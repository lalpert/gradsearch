S"<p>Dor Abrahamson studies mathematics learning from the complementary perspectives of cognitive science, socio-cultural theory, and semiotics. Central to his research is the creation of mathematics learning systems. This craft is motivated by an emerging thesis that the human mind is embodied and, therefore, mathematics learning depends on stimulating, blending, and anchoring imagistic fragments drawn from simple sensorimotor activity -- students build personal meaning for disciplinary notation through abductive reasoning and semiotic leaps.</p><p>Abrahamson directs the Embodied Design Research Laboratory. EDRL projects are typical of the design-based research multi-disciplinary approach: inspired by all students's capacity to deeply understand mathematics subject matter, e.g., rational numbers, probability, and statistics, and driven by specific conjectures as how to engender such understanding, EDRL members build task-based activities involving mixed-media materials they engineer, construct, and iteratively modify. By analyzing student multimodal behaviors -- speech, gesture -- as they engage in these activities, EDRL develops theoretical models of learning linked to pragmatic design frameworks.</p><p>Recipient, National Academy of Education/Spencer Postdoctoral Fellowship for Seeing Chance, a design-based research project that investigates how students build personal meaning for probability concepts.</p>"

S'<p>&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;Much of my research is focused on the development of new algorithms and methods for addressing problems in structural biology. In collaboration with researchers from Los Alamos National Lab, Duke University and Cambridge University we are developing a new software system with NIH Program Project funding, called PHENIX, for the automated solution of macromolecular structures using crystallographic methods. With other NIH funding we are also pursuing projects that expand the scope of PHENIX to include the analysis of neutron diffraction data, and single particle cryo-EM reconstruction methods.    &amp;lt;P&amp;gt;As Head of the Berkeley Center for Structural Biology I oversee the development, maintenance and operation of five synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular crystallographic data collection. We are constantly upgrading the facilities to provide researchers with the best tools for data collection and structure solution. An area of particular interest to me is the structural study of large macromolecular machines combining multiple experimental and computational methods.    &amp;lt;P&amp;gt;Global warming has become a major world issue and carbon dioxide gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a significant contributor to the problem. The need to develop carbon-neutral and renewable sources of energy has become a priority. The conversion of cellulosic (plant) material to fuels such as ethanol has the potential to provide a significant fraction of fuel in the future. As part of the Joint Bioenergy Institute I am developing new technologies to improve the conversion of biomass to fuels. As part of the Energy Biosciences Institute I am collaborating with others to develop new methods for the chemical imaging of plant call wall material.</p>'

S'<p>String theory is the only known solution to the problem which is at the core of modern physics: the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and gravity. Moreover, the most important physical principles: gauge theory and general relativity, are predicted by string theory. Finally, it is a realization of an old dream: that physics at the fundamental level should be determined by mathematical principles alone, and no arbitrary dimensionless parameters.</p><p>Duality is a cornerstone of our current understanding of string theory. Duality means that there can be different descriptions of the same theory, some very simple and classical, and others highly complicated and quantum mechanical. Dualities have taught us that what originally appeared as distinct superstring theories are in fact the weakly coupled descriptions of a single theory in various regimes. It is this uniqueness, together with the properties mentioned above, that make string theory the leading candidate for the fundamental theory of nature. </p><p>While duality as a phenomenon is not specific to string theory, in string theory duality is pervasive. The various dualities discovered in string theory have led to numerous advances in quantum field theory (e.g., the exact solutions of some supersymmetric gauge theories), mathematics (e.g. Calabi-Yau mirror symmetry), and quantum gravity (the counting of black hole entropy). </p><p>It is almost certain that we understand but a small corner of string theory, and that in many regimes string theory looks nothing like the theory of the small loops of string that it started out as. I work on improving our understanding this marvelous structure that we call string theory, uncovering its dualities and studying their consequences in the physics and mathematics contexts. </p>'

S'<p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pathogens afford a unique perspective on the molecular logic of regulatory circuits in physiology and disease. We are focusing on understanding signaling systems in  tuberculosis and AIDS in order to discover molecular mechanisms in human biology and  to define targets for new therapeutics.  The primary tools we use are X-ray  crystallography, molecular biology, genomics, genetics and physical biochemistry.   To open new systems to biochemical and structural characterization, we are  developing methods to detect protein ensembles using X-ray crystallography and to  automate protein production.  Large-scale projects include the Keck MacroLab (PI),  the UCB/UCSF Protein Crystallography Beamline (PI), the TB Structural Genomics  consortium (founding member) and the HIV Accessory and Regulatory Complex Center  (founding member).&amp;lt;p/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    Current projects&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regulatory mechanisms in infectious disease.  Despite the availability of  therapeutics, annual TB (along with AIDS and malaria) remains among the \xc3\xaf\xc2\xbf\xc2\xbdbig three\xc3\xaf\xc2\xbf\xc2\xbd  causes of infectious disease mortality worldwide. To develop faster TB treatments  and blunt the spread of emerging drug resistant strains, we need a better  understanding of the host interactions of the TB bacillus, Mycobacterium  tuberculosis (Mtb).  Toward this end, a major goal of our group is to define the  mechanisms signaling through Ser/Thr/Tyr protein phosphorylation in TB.  Through  reversible protein phosphorylation, protein kinases and phosphates provide the  machinery for environmental sensing and physiological signaling.  In addition to the  traditional two-component signaling systems Mtb expresses 11 &amp;quot;&amp;quot;eukaryotic-like&amp;quot;&amp;quot;  Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs) and four protein phosphates that are candidate  mediators of developmental changes and host interactions.  The biological functions  of these systems are largely unknown.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;P&amp;gt;Using a combination of structural and biochemical methods, we have established a  framework for understanding the Mtb systems for Ser/Thr/Tyr protein phosphorylation.   We determined the first structures of the major phospho-signaling modules, which in  concert with biochemical studies, support the central idea that universal mechanisms  of regulation and substrate recognition govern the functions of prokaryotic and  eukaryotic STPKs and phosphatases.  We discovered that the bacterial STPKs are  activated by dimerization through an ancient allosteric interface in the kinase  domain.  Recently, we defined the mechanism of activation by autophosphorylation,  and evidence suggests that this pathway also applies to eukaryotic protein kinases.   Our collaborative study with Jeff Cox (UCSF) demonstrated that at least one of the  Mtb STPKs controls a global regulator or transcription, allowing Mtb to change the  expression of numerous genes in response to environmental cues.  In collaboration  with Prof. Jon Ellman (UCB Chemistry), Merck-Serono and Plexxikon, we have developed  potent inhibitors of Mtb STPKs and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).  Our future  work focuses on the systems functions and localization of the Mtb STPKs and PTPs in  vivo, and on characterizing substrate interactions, Mtb mutants and inhibitors.&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mtb also uses secreted lipids to thwart host defenses.  We are characterizing the  structure, biosynthesis pathway and function of a novel Mtb terpene that is crucial  for virulence.  An emerging goal is to test the linkage between lipid production and  virulence in clinical strains.  A second focus is to define the function and  structure of a complex membrane channel that plays a critical role in infections in  vivo.  Our structural studies are defining the architecture of the channel with the  aim of discovering the key metabolite that is transported.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In collaboration with investigators at UCSF, we are exploring the mechanisms by  which HIV takes over host cells.  This project, part of the HIV Accessory and  Regulatory Complex Center headed by Prof. Alan Frankel (UCSF), focuses on  identifying the recognition determinants and allosteric effects of HIV Nef.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Structural studies lie at the heart of our exploration of regulatory mechanisms. To  speed crystallographic work, we developed a program called Elves, which automates  the computational steps of X-ray structure determination.  In addition, we operate  collaboratively a shared X-ray beamline at the Lawrence Berkeley National  Laboratory. We routinely use this facility for crystallographic work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Protein polymorphism.  Protein recognition and function depend on a balance between  structural rigidity and flexibility.  We have developed two new methods for defining  conformational polymorphism in protein structures.  Mathematical analysis of dozens  of structures in the Protein Data Bank suggests that native proteins adopt a large  number of specific, alternate conformations that previously have escaped detection.   Our results indicate that native protein structures generally are much less unique  than currently believed.  The alternate native conformations provide specific  reservoirs of structural polymorphism that can facilitate folding, function and  evolution.  Coupled shifts may reflect intramolecular signaling pathways while  uncoupled conformations contribute to the residual entropy of the native state.   Modeling these ensembles and exploring their functional significance in enzymes and  signaling proteins represent fruitful directions for ongoing work.  These studies  have practical applications in drug discovery.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</p>'

She teaches primarily in the Jurisprudence and Social Policy program, an interdisciplinary doctoral program focused on the study of legal and political institutions through the perspectives and methods of economics, history, sociology, political science, and philosophy. Albiston\'s legal expertise is in employment law, with an emphasis on gender and work/family policy.</p><p>Following law school, Albiston clerked for Judge Susan Illston of the Northern District of California and practiced law at the Employment Law Center, a project of the Legal Aid Society of San Francisco. From 1995 to 1997, she held a Skadden Fellowship and litigated some of the first federal cases brought under the Family and Medical Leave Act. After completing her Ph.D., Albiston joined the law faculty at the University of Wisconsin, where she also held affiliate appointments in Sociology and Women\'s Studies. In 2005, she was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Law &amp; Society Association.</p><p>Albiston\'s research addresses the relationship between law and social change through a variety of empirical projects. She is currently conducting a study of more than 200 public interest law firms that examines how funding sources and other environmental factors affect their strategy, structure, and mission. Her other work includes investigating how law affects normative bias against workers who use family leave, barriers to exercising mandatory leave rights, how litigation affects social movements and social change, judicial deference to institutionalized employment practices, and the politics and effects of unpublished opinion rules. In 2002, her work won the Law &amp; Society Association Dissertation Prize, and she received honorable mention for the Law &amp; Society Association Article Prize in 2001 and again in 2007.</p><p>In 2010, Cambridge University Press published her book, Institutional Inequality and the Mobilization of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Rights on Leave, which examines how the Family and Medical Leave Act operates in the courts and in the workplace. Albiston\'s other recent work includes "Institutional Inequality" in Wisconsin Law Review, "Institutional Perspectives on Law, Work, and Family" in Annual Review of Law &amp; Social Science, "The Procedural Attack on Civil Rights: The Empirical Reality of Buckhannon for the Private Attorney General" in UCLA Law Review (with Nielsen 2007), "The Organization of Public Interest Practice: 1975-2004" in North Carolina Law Review (with Nielsen, 2006), "Anti-essentialism and the Work/Family Dilemma" in Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice (2005), and "Bargaining in the Shadow of Social Institutions: Competing Discourses and Social Change in Workplace Mobilization of Civil Rights," in Law &amp; Society Review (2005).</p>'

With other colleagues, I am studying spring systems in oak woodland/annual grass dominated rangelands to determine spring type, relationship to site, and response to herbivory. I am experimentally manipulating cattle grazing intensity in replicated sub-watersheds containing springs and riparian areas to determine vegetation, channel, and water quality response. I am simultaneously monitoring an ungrazed watershed to determine the yearly cycle of water movement in and through the system.</p><p>I am also interested in grazing season and fire effects on plant community composition, native plant distribution, and water quality and runoff.

S'Our research group uses the concepts of agroecology to obtain a deep understanding of the nature of agroecosystems and the principles by which they function. Throughout our research and writings we have aided in the emergence of agroecology as the discipline that provides the basic ecological principles for how to study, design, and manage sustainable agroecosystems that are both productive and natural resource conserving, and that are also culturally-sensitive, socially-just and economically viable. In particular, our research has focused on the ways in which biodiversity can contribute to the design of pest-stable agroecosystems. Several of our studies concentrate on elucidating the effects of intercropping, covercropping, weed management, and crop-field border vegetation manipulation on pest population density and damage and on the mechanisms enhancing biological control in diversified systems. <p>Our research has also extended into Latin America where the enhancement of biodiversity in agriculture can help the great mass of resource-poor farmers to achieve year-round food self-sufficiency, reduce their reliance on chemical inputs and develop agroecosystems that rebuild the production capacities of their small land holdings. Our approach has consisted of devising integrated farming systems emphasizing soil and water conservation, natural crop protection, and achievement of soil fertility and stable yields through integration of trees, animals, and crops. Much of this work is conducted through inter-institutional partnerships with NGOs, International Research Centers and Universities including networks such as SANE, ANGOC and CLADES, as well as international organizations such as UNDP and the CGIAR.</p>'

S'The research of the Ames lab involves various aspects of tuning-up metabolism tooptimize health. Inadequate intakes of vitamins and minerals are very common and canlead to DNA damage, mitochondrial decay, and other pathologies. Inadequate intake offolate, B12, or B6 leads to uracil incorporation into DNA and chromosome breaks \xe2\x80&#148;aradiation mimic. Inadequate zinc in human cells causes release of oxidants, DNAoxidation, and inactivation of p53 and other zinc enzymes involved in oxidantdefense and DNA damage repair. Inadequate iron intake inactivates Complex IV inmitochondria, which causes oxidant release and mitochondrial decay; in the braincomplex IV inactivation mimics the neurodegeneration of aging. High dose B vitaminscan counteract a poorer Km. As many as one-third of mutations in a gene result inthe corresponding enzyme having an increased Km (decreased binding affinity) for acoenzyme, resulting in a lower rate of reaction. About 50 different human geneticdiseases due to a poorer binding affinity of the mutant enzyme for its coenzyme, canbe remedied by feeding high dose B vitamins, which raise levels of the correspondingcoenzyme; many polymorphisms also result in a lowered affinity of enzyme forcoenzyme. Mitochondria decay with age due to oxidation of RNA/DNA, proteins, andlipids, is a major contributor to aging, and can be ameliorated by feeding old ratsthe normal mitochondrial metabolites acetyl carnitine (ALCAR) and lipoic acid (LA)at high levels. The principle behind this effect appears to be that with ageincreased oxidative damage to protein causes a deformation of structure of keyenzymes, with a consequent lessening of affinity (Km) for the enzyme substrate. <p>The effect of age on the enzyme binding affinity can be mimicked by reacting it withmalondialdehyde (a lipid peroxidation product). Feeding the substrate (acetylcarnitine) with lipoic acid, a mitochondrial antioxidant, restores the velocity ofthe reaction, Km for acyl carnitine transferase, and mitochondrial function. In oldrats (vs. young rats) mitochondrial membrane potential, cardiolipin level,respiratory control ratio, and cellular O2 uptake are lower; oxidants/02, neuron RNAoxidation, and mutagenic aldehydes from lipid peroxidation are higher. Ambulatoryactivity and cognition declines with age. Feeding old rats acetyl carnitine andlipoic acid for a few weeks restores mitochondrial function; lowers oxidants, neuronRNA oxidation, and mutagenic aldehydes; and increases rat ambulatory activity andcognition (as assayed with the Skinner box and Morris water maze). An optimum intakeof micronutrients and metabolites, which varies with age and genetics, should tuneup metabolism and markedly increase health at little cost, particularly for the poorand elderly.</p>'

S'<p>The people in my laboratory study (1) the processes of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling, (2) environmental and ecological conditions of the past, and (3) ways of developing improved means of dating soils and landscapes, using a combination of stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry. </p><p>We are actively engaged in better understanding the climatic and geological controls on the rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling in soils from around the world and the way in which soils serve as an important control on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. We have been using natural levels of 14C in soil organic matter to understand how climate and soil age control natural rates of carbon cycling in soils from a wide spectrum of field settings. We have examined how agriculture and forestry alter these rates of cycling. We are studying how the natural abundances of 18O/16O in soil CO2 may help to better serve as a tool in understanding the rates of sources and sinks to the atmospheric CO2 budget.</p><p> For more than a decade, we have been examining the way in which the isotopic composition of soils reflects climate and vegetation. Using ratios of stable carbon (13C/12C), nitrogen (15N/14N), and oxygen (18O/16O). We have shown that soil organic matter and calcium carbonate can reflect important characteristics about vegetation and climatic patterns. We, and others, have used these relationships to learn more about past climates using paleosols (soils that have been buried and preserved in sedimentary rock). Our research has extended to include fossil plants, in order to learn more about how physiological processes in plants record information about climatic conditions through variations in isotopic ratios in their tissues. We are also investigating the isotopic composition of modern and fossil animals as a means of determining their diet and environmental conditions. </p><p><i><b>Current Field Projects:</b></i>, , Atacama Desert, Chile: We are collaborating with NASA investigators to study the biology and chemistry of soils in extreme environments, to better understand (through earth analogues) the past (or present) biogeochemistry of Mars. </p><p>Great Valley and Sierra Nevada, California: We are currently studying the rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling in soils that range in age from about 1,000 to 3,000,000 years in the Great Valley of California, and along elevation (climate) gradients of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. </p><p>Wind River Basin, Wyoming: We are collaborating with colleagues from UC Santa Barbara and the Berkeley Geochronology Institute to develop U/Th isotope techniques to date the soils and landscapes of the Wind. </p><p>River Basin.

S"The Andersen research group is primarily interested in synthesis and reactions of molecules that alter the way chemists think. The traditional view of the f-block metals is that they do not form compounds with pi-backbonding ligands, such as CO. This classical view is no longer tenable since CO does bind to these metals, in their metallocene derivatives, with small but measurable bond enthalpies. A molecule that is somewhat similar to CO in its' ability to act as a pi-acceptor ligand is bipyridyl.  The f-block metallocene derivatives of this ligand is used to change the population of various electron-exchange tautomers, which in turn changes their equilibrium population.  Thus, the chemical identity and reaction chemistry of each species can be studied.  Studies such as these are defining new ways to look at f-element chemistry. New preparations of f-block metallocenes with pi-donors, such as oxo and imido ligands, make these multiply bonded species available so that their intrinsic reactivity patterns can be studied experimentally and computationally."

S'<p>The Anderson Group works to develop the applications and foundation technologies for Synthetic Biology, a ground-up approach to genetic engineering with applications in chemical production, healthcare, bioenergy, and environmental remediation.  Anderson is the tumor-killing bacteria testbed leader of SynBERC, an NSF Engineering Research Center with members at MIT, Harvard, UCSF, UC-Berkeley, and Prairie View A&amp;amp;M University.  This collaborative project seeks to engineer bacteria starting with non-pathogenic laboratory strains of E. coli that can be safely introduced into the bloodstream, localize to and invade cancer cells, and kill them.  Technically, this involves computer modeling, molecular biology techniques for building the DNAs, and a battery of biochemical, microbiological, immunological, and histological assays for analyzing the behavior of the bacteria both in vitro and in mice.  In addition to its therapeutic goals, the project challenges our technical abilities to engineer biological systems on the level of complexity of natural systems and provides a testbed for evaluating new foundational tools being developed in the center.  Additionally, the Anderson lab develops tools for protein engineering and automated DNA assembly.  Tools for the genetic selection of new biological activities from large combinatorial gene libraries are being developed.  These tools have application in identifying DNA sequences encoding proteins with new enzymatic and regulatory properties or the identification of environmentally-responsive regulatory elements.  At the core of all synthetic biology activities is a need for rapid and cost-effective strategies for constructing DNAs of defined sequence.  The Anderson lab is developing a method for automated Biobrick DNA assembly.  Using a combination of engineered bacteriophages and E. coli strains with robotic liquid handling systems, the system will allow the convergent, parallel synthesis of DNAs with defined sequence thereby alleviating the rate-limiting step in the construction of synthetic organisms.</p>'

S"Work in Professor Arnold's research group is directed toward the synthesis and study of new and unusual molecular inorganic and organometallic compounds of the d- and p- block, and lanthanide elements. The emphasis is on preparing compounds that exhibit novel reactivity and/or catalytic behavior (both homogeneously and heterogeneously). In addition to the dry-box and Schlenk techniques used to prepare and manipulate compounds, we exploit a variety of characterization methods, including multinuclear NMR, X-ray crystallography, ESR and cyclic voltammetry. In the solid-state, we employ TGA/DTA, RBS, SEM and powder diffraction to determine the compositionand purity of our materials.Research is concentrated in two main areas spanning organometallic and coordination chemistry, catalysis, and the design of new materials:, , <b>Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis</b>, <p>The focus here is on the design and synthesis of new ligands that are capable of supporting novel structural features and reactivity. Currently, we are investigating ligand architectures based on triazacyclononane, amidine, and diamide frameworks. An important aspect of this work is its application to catalysis. Our recent efforts have focused on polymerization of a-olefins and lactide, and we are especially interested in developing new complexes for use in enantioselective synthesis. </p><b>Materials Chemistry</b><p>Our recent work has explored two areas of materials chemistry. New routes to important solid-state semiconductorts, such as GaN and ZnSe, have been developed using single-source precursor chemistry. We are especially interested in the development of new ion conducting systems and their application as solid electrolytes for lithium batteries.

I am intrigued by the bizarre behavior of fully <b>ionized plasmas</b>, which mix long range electromagnetic forces with kinetic particle behavior. I merge these interests by studying the magnetospheres of neutron stars and their interactions with their environs, and their role in the acceleration of the highest energy <b>cosmic rays</b>. I also have interests in the <b>magnetized accretion disks</b> around <b>black holes</b>, whose physics has similarities to that of the outflows from rotation powered pulsars. In a new adventure, I am studying the interactions between stellar magnetic fields and the recently discovered <b>planets</b> around nearby solar type stars.</p><p><i>Current Projects</i></p><p><b>Time Dependent Structure of Relativistic Shocks in Pulsar Driven Nebulae:</b> Theory and simulation of relativistic collisionless shock wave structure, with application to the termination shocks of the pulsars' winds in the Crab Nebula and in other nebulae energized by the winds from rotation powered neutron stars. Recent and current projects include a) a hybrid (MHD electrons and positrons, kinetic high energy ions) theory of the shock structure teminating the wind in the Crab Nebula - a Chandra inage of the Crab showing the inner X-ray ring whose time dependent properites are similar to the hybrid model, is shown on the left, the wave strudture in the hybrid model is in the middle, and a Chandra image of the galactic supernovsa remnant G320.4 around the young pulsar PSR1509-54, to which the theory also applies, appears below right; b) a calculation of the nonthermal particle spectrum generated in hybrid shock structures of this type. These projects are all carried out with students.</p><p><b>Theory of Particle Beam Acceleration and Transport in Pulsars; the Theory of Pulsar Pair Creation:</b> Pulsars' winds are primarily composed of electron-positron plasmas, created from gamma rays emitted by a relativistic electron beam accelerated from the stellar surface. Current theoretical efforts include: a) a determination of the maximum rotation period beyond which the gamma rays no longer convert to electron-positron pairs, with a comparison to the observed periods beyond which pulsars stop being radio photon emitters; b) the solution of the cascade equations describing the development of the pair plasma's momentum space distribution with height about a pulsar's surface, with a prediction of the residual gamma ray spectrum that escapes to infinity, including modeling the plasma's radial and transverse inhomogeneity; c) a study of the instability of the primary particle beam's flow, in the weaker magnetic field at large radii of the pulsar, with application to modeling the beaming fluctuations of radio pulsars. These are also student projects.</p><p><b> Theory of Pulsar Radio Emission:</b> Calculations of the electromagnetic emission due to the shear flow of the boundary layer between the polar flow of pair plasma and the neighboring region of closed magnetic field lines. These calculations, involving both linear and weakly non-linear analytic calculations of plasma instability and saturation as well as numerical calculations of non-linear saturation of the plasma emission processes, will be applied to the quantitative interpretation of pulsar radio signals.</p>"

S'<p>Albert Russell Ascoli, Ph.D. Cornell University, is Terrill Distinguished Professor in the Department of Italian Studies. His principal field of study is Medieval and Early Modern Italian culture from the 13th to the 16th centuries. Teaching and research interests include the relations between literary form and history; intertwined configurations of authorship and readership; the construction of Italian national identity from the Renaissance to the Risorgimento; literary politics of gender; Dante, Machiavelli, Ariosto. His point of departure is the close, historically and culturally informed, reading of texts, literary and other; these readings, however, frequently give rise to methodological and/or theoretical interrogation of critical practice. Most significant recent published work includes "Italian Futures," edited, with Randolph Starn(special issue of California Italian Studies, 2011); "A Local Habitation, and a Name: Imagining Histories in Renaissance Italy"(Fordham University Press, 2011); "Italy in the Drama of Europe," edited, with William West (special double issue of Renaissance Drama, 2010); "Dante and the Making of a Modern Author" (Cambridge University Press, 2008);  "Making and Remaking Italy: The Cultivation of National Identity around the Risorgimento," edited, with Krystyna von Henneberg (Berg Press, 2001).</p>'

S'<p>The central focuse of my research is on the physical, biological, and chemical processes that control trace gas and energy exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, ozone, sulfur dioxide, isoprene, monoterpenes, methane, NOx and nitrous oxide are among the trace gases that interest me. Theoretical and field studies on trace gas exchange between the bio-sphere-atmosphere interactions are being performed to understand an array of global change issues. These issues include the radiative balance and oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, the carbon, water and nutrient balances of ecosystems and the daily growth of the planetary boundary layer.  A secondary focus of my research is on micrometeorology of plant canopies. This work involves studying the characteristics of wind, turbulence, radiation and scalar fields above and within plant stands and footprints of trace gas exchange above and within vegetation. A detailed understanding of canopy micrometeorology is needed to quantify the light, temperature, wind and humidity environment that is in contact with plants and the underlying soil, as these factors drive many trace gas exchange processes. Information on these variables used to develop and implement a hierarchy of soil-atmosphere-vegetation transfer (SVAT) models.</p><p><strong>Current Projects </strong></p><p>Information on carbon dioxide, water vapor and energy fluxes between land and the atmosphere is needed to quantify and understand how the state of the atmosphere is varying with time and in space. Knowing how strong terrestrial carbon sources and sinks are, how they will respond to environmental perturbations and how they vary diurnally, seasonally and inter-annually are the among the questions that remain unresolved within the carbon cycle research community. We are currently conducting a multi-year modeling and field study on the seasonal, annual and inter-annual variations of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy, exchange above and below an oak-grass savanna, near Ione, CA. This forest represents a system that experiences seasonal water deficits and forms an open canopy, causing it to be vertically and horizontally heterogeneous. This study is supported by the US DOE Terrestrial Carbon Project and a member of the AmeriFlux project and FLUXNET Program.</p><p>In addition to our site-specific work, we are coordinating an international group of long term carbon, water and energy measurement sites in a NSF sponsored project called FLUXNET. This project combines the efforts of regional flux networks (i.e., EUROFLUX, AmeriFlux, AsiaNet) into an integrated global network. An aspect of this research activity is to use field data to understand and synthesize how climate, soil, and plant variables affect trace gas fluxes to and from a variety of ecosystems (crops, grasslands, conifer and broadleaved forests, savanna). We endeavor to use field data to test and validate process-level trace gas flux models and develop algorithms that can be used by satellite-driven measurements to conduct global ecology calculations on net primary productivity.</p><p>A third project involves the study of methane and CO2 change over a peatland in the SanJoaquin-Sacramento Delta.  We are examining the roles of land use change on net greenhouse gas fluxes</p>'

S'My research program encompasses vascular-plant systematics, floristics, and conservation biology, with an emphasis on biosystematic and phylogenetic studies. I am particularly interested in systematic questions that address evolutionary processes, historical biogeography and ecology, and relationships of California plants and their descendant lineages elsewhere (e.g., Hawaii). My research on the California tarweeds and the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Compositae: Madiinae) has involved testing of hypotheses concerning diversification processes and rates, chromosomal and morphological evolution, ecological shifts, dispersal events, and the evolutionary importance of hybridization. I am also involved in collaborative investigations focused on evolution of breeding and pollination systems in flowering plants. <p>Laboratory techniques used in my research include DNA sequencing, restriction site mapping, and cytogenetic and morphological analyses. Recent theoretical and technological advances in systematics offer exciting opportunities for studies of California plant evolution and relationships. The rich diversity of the California flora and the extensive literature from evolutionary research on California plants pose well-defined and important systematics research problems for graduate study.</p>'

S'<p>I am interested in plasma astrophysics from the experimental point of view. Much of the universe is in the plasma state and we are just coming to appreciate the role of plasma dynamics and magnetic fields in the large-scale evolution of astrophysical systems. However, many of the fundamental processes are poorly understood and can only be studied in a limited parameter regime in the laboratory. Examples are magnetic reconnection, collisionless shocks, and solar/stellar wind generation and evolution.</p><p>My research is focused on developing experiments to understand these processes and, in particular, how microscale, kinetic phenomena, affect large-scale plasma evolution.</p><p>I am also interested in low frequency (LF) radio astronomy, at frequencies below the ionospheric cutoff (~12 MHz); these observations need to be made from space. Signatures of solar flare electrons and CMEs dominate the dynamics at these frequencies, however the large-scale structure of the radio sky below 15 MHz remains mostly unexplored. This structure maps the galactic magnetic field and cosmic ray electrons and may hold information from the recombination epoch.</p><p>Our group at the Space Sciences Laboratory develops, builds, and operates space-borne experiments to study in situ the plasma processes active in astrophysical, heliospheric, and magnetospheric systems. These experiments are flown on NASA and ESA spacecraft missions and are often developed as balloon and sounding rocket payloads.</p>'

S"<p>Nitash P. Balsara's received his PhD in Chemical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1988.</p><p> His research program is based on soft microstructured materials such as block copolymer melts, polymer blends, and microemulsions. Principles of solid state physics provide a recipe for creating soft materials. The modulus of an ordered phase is inversely proportional to the thermally driven mean square displacement of the ordered units and the lattice spacing. The soft materials he studies are thus characterized by large lattice spacing ranging from nanometers to microns, and large fluctuations wherein the magnitude of the mean square displacement approaches, and sometimes exceeds, the lattice spacing. These characteristics often lead to slow relaxation processes, which, in turn, enable fundamental investigations of non-equilibrium phenomena such as nucleation. </p><p> He specializes in the study of soft structures that self-assemble from the liquid state. The self-assembled nature of these structures has important consequences-they form spontaneously and do not require machining or lithography. The structure need not be permanently fixed; it can be altered by changing external variables such as temperature, pressure, and electric fields. Subtle changes in the external variables could lead to profound changes in the mechanical, optical and electrical properties of the material if they are accompanied by a microstructural transition. These changes could be accomplished repeatedly and reversibly if the structures are at equilibrium. These materials thus have the potential of performing complex functions, if we can understand the physical origins of their complex responses and control them to produce useful results.</p><p>His program is concerned with both synthesis and characterization of soft polymer materials. His lab measures soft polymers' response to changes in external variables by a variety of in-situ probes such as small angle neutron scattering and depolarized light scattering. Their objective is to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the measured response and the molecular structure of the components that comprise our system.</p><p></p>"

S'<p>Andrew Barshay received his A.B. in Oriental Languages, his M.A. in  Asian Studies, and his Ph.D in History from the University of  California, Berkeley. <br /><br />His recent research investigates the history of Japanese social  science from the 1890s to the present day.  In The Social Sciences in  Modern Japan he considers the various forms of modernity that the  processes of "development" or "rationalization" have engendered and the  role social scientists have played in their emergence.  Barshay argues  that Japan, together with Germany and pre-revolutionary Russia,  represented forms of developmental alienation from the Atlantic Rim  symptomatic of late-emerging empires. Neither members nor colonies of  the Atlantic Rim, these were independent national societies whose  cultural self-image was nevertheless marked by a sense of difference. <br /><br />Barshay presents a historical overview of major Japanese trends and  treats two of the most powerful streams of Japanese social science, one  associated with Marxism, the other with Modernism (kindaishugi), whose  most representative figure is the late Maruyama Masao. Demonstrating  that a sense of developmental alienation shaped the thinking of social  scientists in both streams, he argues that they provided Japanese social  science with moments of shared self-understanding. <br /><br />Barshay\'s new research examines the collapse of the Japanese empire  in the northeast, particularly the former "puppet state" of Manchukuo,  under the impact of the Soviet invasion at the very end of World War II.   Millions of Japanese civilians were left stranded in their vanquished  empire as Japanese forces dissolved, and at least 600,000 Japanese  soldiers were transported to the USSR and interned in the gulag for  years of forced labor.  This experience has been called one of the "epic  tragedies" of the war, and unless it is understood, Barshay suggests,  Japan\'s troubled postwar relations with Russia and China will remain beyond our grasp.</p>'

He has been working in spline curve/surface representation and their applications in computer graphics and geometric modeling for many years. He is applying his knowledge of curve/surface representations as well as his computer graphics experience to improving videokeratography and corneal topographic mapping, forming a mathematical model of the cornea, and providing computer visualization of patients' corneas to clinicians. This has applications in the design and fabrication of contact lenses, and in laser vision correction surgery. His current research, called Vision-Realistic Rendering is developing new three-dimensional rendering techniques for the computer generation of synthetic images that will simulate the vision of specific individuals based on their actual patient data using measurements from a instrument a Shack-Hartmann wavefront aberrometery device. This research forms the OPTICAL (OPtics and Topography Involving Cornea and Lens) project."

S"The research program of Professor Bartlett and his coworkers is grounded in organic synthesis but closely connected to biological questions. His group is interested in the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitors, in developing strategies for mimicking and controlling peptide conformation, and in devising synthetic methods and other tools for combinatorial chemistry. Biological targets include enzymes that hydrolyze peptidases and carbohydrates, and those of the shikimate-chorismate pathway. Structure-based approaches are used in the design of molecules to induce specific peptide conformations such as a a-helices or b-sheets, as well as small molecules ligands for protein binding sites. Current projects in combinatorial chemistry exemplify the principles of 'combinatorial synthetic design' and involve the development of syntheses of novel heterocyclic molecules that can be applied to the preparation of diverse libraries on solid phase.  Library-based selection strategies are also combined with structural and mechanistic principles for the discovery of enzyme inhibitors. Most projects provide a range of experience in Professor Bartlett's laboratory, from organic synthesis to mechanistic enzymology to structural studies and computer modeling."

S'<p>Rangeland ecosystems form extensive wildland landscapes visually dominated by grassland, shrubland, and savanna vegetation. Two important natural processes that control the structure and function of these ecosystems are herbivory and fire. Successful restoration, conservation, and use of rangelands usually requires the use of fire and herbivory and an understanding of vegetation response.Mediterranean-type savanna ecosystems are found as five small pockets in California, Chile, South Africa, Australia, and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Each area has a distinctive biota which humans have systematically homogenized over the past few thousand years. The Mediterranean-type savanna is an ideal laboratory for examining the relationships among long-lived woody plants, usually native; short-lived herbs, usually non-native; and grazing animals, at different ecological scales. Because people have had highly variable effects on the different systems, usually by changing grazing and burning regimes, comparative study of different regions can yield important insights into how native species may be enhanced and protected in restoration or conservation programs.Current Projects , , We are conducting several field experiments testing the effects of controlled cattle grazing and burning on biomass productivity, vegetation spatial structure, and water quality. This project is designed to test several theories about how grazing and burning may have changed the original California savanna and point the way to successful methods for ecosystem restoration. Results from these studies have shown that livestock grazing and prescribed fire, when properly applied, can enhance native plant recovery, may be useful for modifying vegetation structure, and does not degrade water quality. </p>'

S'<p>David Bates works on two main research tracks. The first is the history of political and legal thought, from the 17th century through the 20th century. He is particular interested in the relationship between violence, law, and political foundation. Topics range from early modern notions of the constitutional state, to 20th century ideas on emergency and political unity. He recently published "<i>States of War: Enlightenment Origins of the Political</i>" (Columbia Univ. Press, 2012) The other research track involves the history of science, technology, media, and cognition. Bates is working on a book that traces ideas of human "insight" in the era of modern science. The project begins with Descartes and early ideas concerning machines and thinking, and continues through major transformations in thought spurred by new technologies and new sciences of the body and nervous systems. The book will end with a study of cybernetics and digital media technology. The project aims to provide a critical history of "Artificial Intelligence" understood in the widest sense of the term.</p>'

S'<p>The goal of my research program is to know how and why forests change. My efforts are guided by the conviction that our understanding must apply to specific forests with all the attendant complexities and idiosyncrasies. Thus robust, quantitative field studies form the core of my approach. Answering these questions is more than just an interesting academic puzzle. As a result of human enterprise (e.g., pollution, land transformations, biotic additions and losses), many forest ecosystems will experience fundamentally novel challenges. In the face of this uncertainty, we need to understand the dynamics well enough to anticipate the likely direction and magnitude of responses.   Change in forests is typically mediated by cycles of disturbance and recovery. A central tenet in forest ecology is that the course and rate of recovery is determined by the extent and intensity of the initiating disturbance. In this sense, the disturbance regime is an integral and relatively predictable aspect of forest dynamics. The increasing prevalence of anthropogenic influences and the prospects for these stresses to interact with natural processes underscore the need to refocus attention from the ordinary to the extraordinary.</p>'

S'In mammals, the initial detection of noxious chemical, mechanical or thermal stimuli\xe2\x80&#147; a process referred to as nociception \xe2\x80&#147; is mediated by specialized somatosensoryneurons called nociceptors. Surprising little is known about the moleculesunderlying nociception. How painful stimuli excite nociceptors and how injurychanges sensitivity to touch and pain are open questions. Our current researchfocuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of somatosensorymechanotransduction. Because many forms of injury are accompanied by mechanicalhypersensitivity, understanding the molecular basis of mechanosensation will help toelucidate chronic pain mechanisms. Despite its widespread importance, little isknown about the molecular mechanisms that mechanosensitive neurons use to detectbenign and harmful touch. We are using two approaches to identify the transductionevents underlying somatosensory mechanotransduction. First, we are developing newtools for the functional analysis of somatosensory neurons. Second, in collaborationwith Dr. Ken Catania (Vanderbilt U.), we are investigating the cellular andmolecular basis of touch reception in star-nosed moles.'

S'<b>Current Projects</b>, <p><i>Salivary gland development</i> We have chosen to study the development of an apparently simple organ, the salivary gland of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, with the hope of characterizing the entire genetic pathway which controls its determination and morphogenesis. Because each gland is assembled from a small number of cells (about 100), because the glands are the first functional organs to form in the embryo, and because we can examine the genetic control of both their determination and morphogenesis, we can use salivary gland development to address many important questions about organogenesis. </p><p>The salivary glands develop from the ventral epidermis of a single embryonic segment. We have shown that the salivary primordium is initially specified by the homeotic gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) which induces the transcription of all early salivary-specific genes. The primordium is then divided into pregland and preduct cells by signaling from the ventral midline via the EGF receptor pathway. This signal restricts the FORK HEAD transcription factor to the pregland cells and the TRACHEALESS transcription factor to the preduct cells. A third transcription factor, EYE GONE is restricted to a few posterior pregland cells and the posterior half of the preduct cells. As a result of their overlapping domains of expression, these three transcriptional regulators define the fate of four distinct regions of the salivary glands. </p><p>After the fate of the cells is determined, morphogenesis begins. The primordium invaginates into the interior of the embryo in a complex and coordinated process to form tubular salivary glands that are connected to the pharynx by Y-shaped tubular ducts. Cells in the four defined regions invaginate by at least three different mechanisms, apparently specified by combinations of the three transcriptional regulators. We now want to investigate how genes downstream from these transcription factors direct the changes in cell shape that accompany these complex cell rearrangements and how the rearrangements are coordinated so that a continuous lumen links cells invaginatedby different mechanisms. We have initiated a variety of genetic and molecular screens to identify downstream genes and to determine their roles in salivary morphogenesis. </p><p><i>Oogenesis and the Tec29 tyrosine kinase.</i> During oogenesis in Drosophila, the growth of the oocyte as well as the determination of its dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes relies on gene products made in the adjacent nurse cells. These nurse cell gene products are transferred to the oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges known as ring canals. The ring canals are dynamic structures that increase in diameter more than ten-fold during oogenesis by the addition of large amounts of filamentous actin and the slippage of preexisting actin filaments past each other. We have shown that the TEC29 tyrosine kinase is localized to the ring canals and regulates their growth. We have begun to define a TEC29 signaling pathway by showing that a second tyrosine kinase, SRC64, is required for TEC29 localization to the ring canals and that both proteins are required for tyrosine phosphorylation of ring canal proteins. These are intriguing results because mammalian SRC and TEC family kinases have been shown to interact and to regulate cytoskeletal organization. The rest of the signaling pathway is, however, largely undefined. We are now using both genetic and physical interaction screens to identify other members in this pathway, especially the downstream targets that interact with the actin cytoskeleton.</p>'

S'<p>Professor Bell is interested in understanding the fundamental relationships between the structure and composition of heterogeneous catalysts and their performance. The study of reaction mechanisms and the identification of factors limiting the activity and selectivity of catalysts are also objectives of his research. Reaction systems being investigated include the synthesis of oxygenated compounds from COx (x = 1, 2), the conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygenated products under oxidizing conditions, and the reduction of nitric oxide under oxidizing conditions. The objectives of his program are pursued through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Spectroscopic techniques, including IR, Raman, NMR, UV-Visible, and EXAFS, are used to characterize catalyst structure and adsorbed species under actual conditions of catalysis. Isotopic tracers and temperature-programmed desorption and reaction techniques are used to elucidate the pathways via which catalyzed reactions occur. Quantum chemical calculations are conducted to define the structure and energetics of adsorbed species and the pathways by which such species are transformed. The combined use of theory and experimental methods enables the attainment of a deeper understanding of the core issues of interest than can be achieved by the use of either approach alone. In pursuing his research Professor Bell draws upon 32 years of experience in the pursuit of fundamental issues relevant to catalysis. He is the author or co-author of over 370 technical publications.</p>'

S"<p>Our research interests lie in understanding the molecular basis of protein function. In particular, we aim to develop mechanistic models that explain how proteins physically exploit shape and chemistry to assemble into large complexes and transduce energy into work. The primary focus of my group's investigations is on proteins that replicate, manipulate, and organize nucleic acids in the cell, and on structural genomics of the pathogenic bacterium, M. tuberculosis. A combination of structural analyses, such as X-ray crystallography, coupled with biochemical experimentation, forms the core of our methodological approach.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Replication initiation and replisome assembly.</i> The initiation of DNA replication relies on a multifunctional complement of proteins that coordinately recognize origin sequences, unwind the origin DNA, and assemble the replisome. Initially, sequence data suggested that replication factors fall into two general classes, bacterial and eukaryotic/archaeal; however, structural and biochemical data indicate that these proteins share fundamental architectural and functional features. To better understand how cells regulate and initiate replication of their genomes, we are studying origin-binding proteins, helicases, primases, and accessory remodeling factors from a variety of organisms within the three cellular domains of life. Work from our group is revealing important information about the mechanisms of origin processing, primer synthesis, and macromolecular assembly that occur during replisome construction. We are now biochemically and structurally dissecting the reaction cycles of these initiation proteins, both individually and complexed with various targets, to better model their molecular activity. </p><p><i>Nucleic acid-dependent motors.</i> The length and double-helical properties of DNA present the cell with topological and information processing challenges. For example, transcription and replication require melting of duplex DNA to read out the coded nucleotide sequence, while chromosomal tangles and knots can arise during replication, recombination, and DNA compaction. To resolve these problems, cells use a host of molecular motor proteins, including type II DNA topoisomerases, helicases, and chromosome-condensation assemblies to modulate and reorganize DNA structure. All of these motor proteins use ATP, but direct it toward different purposes, such as transporting one DNA duplex through a transient break in another, or translocating along a DNA or RNA chain while concomitantally unwinding paired nucleic acid strands. Despite general functional differences, each of these proteins nonetheless uses ATP binding and hydrolysis to trigger cascades of conformational changes that result in motion and force generation. We are currently studying DNA- and RNA-dependent motor proteins from bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic organisms. Using structural analyses of different conformational and substrate-bound states, combined with directed biochemical and enzymological studies, we are determining how such proteins interact with nucleic acids and partner proteins, and how they use ATP to drive the architectural changes required for catalysis and physical movement. </p><p><i>Structural genomics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</i> The bacterium M. tuberculosis is a widespread pathogen that is estimated to have infected nearly a third of the world population. We are working as part of an international consortium to determine the structures of over 400 proteins from this organism. A major goal of this work is to produce structural data of essential M. tuberculosis proteins that may be used to speed vaccine and drug design to combat the spread of the pathogen. The efforts in my lab are focused in several areas including: 1) membrane proteins and their regulatory regions, 2) RNA metabolism, and 3) DNA replication, segregation, and repair.</p>"

S"<p>Professor Bergman and his coworkers utilize a range of chemical techniques to discover new chemical reactions, determine how those reactions work, and apply that understanding to their application in catalysis and organic synthesis. In catalytic reactions very small amounts of soluble organometallic complexes are used to transform much larger quantities of organic compounds--such as those found in living organisms, or in natural feedstock sources such as petroleum--into more complicated substances that might ultimately be useful in the synthesis of important chemical compounds.</p><p>In recent research, Professor Bergman's group has generated reactive organometallic intermediates capable of undergoing intermolecular oxidative addition with the normally inert C-H bonds in alkanes and other organic molecules. This process holds potential for converting alkanes into functionalized organic molecules such as alkenes and alcohols. Liquid xenon and liquid krypton have been developed as useful low-temperature solvents for these reactions, and experiments carried out in collaboration with the Moore and Harris groups, using both conventional and flash kinetic studies, have identified xenon-metal and alkane-metal complexes as intermediates. In recent collaborations with the Ellman and Tilley groups, C-H activating reactions have been used to develop new ring-forming reactions, some of which are enantioselective.</p><p>Another area of investigation involves the study of organometallic complexes having metal-oxygen, -nitrogen and -sulfur bonds to obtain information about the mechanisms of metal-mediated oxidation, amination and desulfurization processes. Some of the compounds prepared in these projects have been utilized in highly enantioselective asymmetric induction reactions, and others act as homogeneous catalysts for new carbon-hydrogen and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming processes such as hydroamination of alkynes and allenes.</p>"

S'<p>My research and teaching focuses largely on comparative social inequality. Other interests include environmental issues and movements, human rights, anthropological ethics, ethnographic methods, and social change in urban, rural and small-scale societies. Geographic areas of special concern are South Asia (especially Himalayan regions of India and Nepal), with secondary interests in American society, the Aleuts and other Arctic and Native American peoples. </p><p>My theoretical approach, and its apposite methodology, I call "social interactionist," which articulates with "symbolic interactionism," "ethnomethodology," "cognitive sociology," and recently, "practice theory." That is, it focuses on the relationship among cognition (including perception and understanding), belief (including value), power and behavior. I have taught on these and other topics in Sweden, India and Nepal, and have been awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Stockholm and Garhwal University, India.</p><p> Recent and current research has been in India and Nepal, dealing with issues of environment and development, and responses to them by local people and by administrators and other outsider elites. My most intensive such work has dealt comparatively with Chipko, the famous grassroots environmental movement in India\'s Garhwal Himalayas, and the anti-big dam movements in India and Nepal, together with governmental responses to them.</p><p> For some 40 years I have pursued a longitudinal study of social inequality (caste, gender, class) and environment in their historical context in a Garhwal village (Sirkanda) and its region. By way of comparison in both culture and scale, I have studied ethnic diversity and inequality in the central bazaar of a city of the adjacent plains (Dehra Dun) and its surroundings. </p><p>Earlier I worked in an Aleutian village on issues of economic, political and social change. This first-hand contact with a "small-scale" society in 20th Century America led to my interest in "The Great Hunter-Gatherer Debate," and its pragmatic and theoretical implications. I became heavily involved in the deconstruction of the "Tasaday hoax", which involved a fraudulent claim during the 1970s-80s, of the discovery of a "stone-age tribe" in Mindinao, Philippines. With regard to ethics, I was co-drafter of the American Anthropological Associations "Principles of Professional Responsibility" (read: "Code of Ethics"), and have engaged in subsequent debates about it.</p>'

S"<p>A major lesson from eukaryotic genome sequencing projects is that the absolute number of genes an organism's genome encodes is not the best parameter for defining biological complexity. Instead, the complex functions associated with human health and disease are determined by combinatorial expansion of genomic information in the form of posttranslational modifications. Of these, the most ubiquitous is glycosylation, highlighting the importance of glycobiology in the postgenomic era. Our research group comprises three major project areas: <b>(1)</b> development of chemical approaches for perturbing and studying glycan function within the context of living cells; <b>(2)</b> investigating the roles of microbial glycoconjugates in pathogenesis, with an emphasis on Mycobacterium tuberculosis; and <b>(3)</b> development of tools for proteomics analysis of protein glycosylation.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Chemical approaches to glycobiology:</i> Cell surface oligosaccharides are major determinants of cell-cell interactions during development, the immune response, and pathogenic processes such as microbial infection and tumor cell metastasis. The presentation of specific carbohydrate epitopes is a reflection of the biosynthetic machinery within the secretory compartments of the cell. Organized among the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi cisternae, the glycosyltrasnferases act in an assembly line to generate functional oligosaccharide structures. The organization of these enzymes within subcellular compartments can be a key determinant of cell surface glycosylation patterns and, accordingly, cell-cell interactions. We have developed a strategy for modulating the activities of glycosyltransferases with small molecules that affect their Golgi localization. We separate their catalytic and localization domains and fuse these to engineered protein modules that will associate in the presence of a synthetic molecule. Thus, the enzymes are conditionally localized in the Golgi compartment by the small molecule drug, and inactive in its absence. We are applying this technique to study the biological functions of glycosyltransferases in cells and in model organisms. </p><p>Another chemical strategy we employ to study glycosylation involves metabolic engineering of unnatural sugar structures. When fed to cells or introduced into laboratory animals, unnatural metabolic precursor sugars can be incorporated into cell surface glycans, thereby altering their biological activities. For example, recognition of sugars by the immune system can be altered by metabolic introduction of unnatural modifications into their structures. We are applying this phenomenon to thedevelopment of a tumor vaccine strategy that targets unusual glycans found only on tumor cells. In addition, we can deliver novel chemical functional groups into glycans by metabolism and target these with exogenous probes by covalent reaction. Applications to tumor targeting with non-invasive imaging reagents are under investigation.</p><p><i> Mycobacterial metabolites involved in pathogenesis:</i> Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of TB and is responsible for around 3 million deaths per year. Current treatment protocols are lengthy and complicated, and multidrug resistant strains have arisen in recent years that remain impossible to treat. Mycobacteria have many unusual features, including a complex cell wall structure comprising sulfated trehalose metabolites that are thought to mediate host-pathogen interactions. We are interested in the biological activities of these metabolites and their biosynthetic origin inside the bacterial cell, with an eye for identifying new avenues for drug development. Toward this end, we are knocking the genes, identified using bioinformatics techniques, that encode key biosynthetic enzymes, analyzing their phenotypes in mouse models of TB, and screening compound libraries for inhibitor leads. We are also pursuing X-ray crystal structures of the most promising enzyme targets. </p><p><i>Proteomics analysis of protein glycosylation:</i> Glycosylation is the most common and complex form of posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. For most glycoproteins, the structures of the glycans and their specific sites of attachment are not known. We are applying the technique of metabolic glycan engineering to the systems-level analysis of protein glycosylation, with a focus on O-linked glycosylation of membrane proteins and GlcNAcylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins.</p>"

S'<p>My main research interest lies on Medieval Latin literature which I approach from a set of related questions that all revolve around a practice of contextualizing and re-contextualizing: what is the relation between literary texts and the intellectual, institutional, and political milieus in which they originate? In what way did medieval and Neo-Latin literary texts negotiate ideas, values, and political claims from within these milieus? Which critical categories are necessary to explore and analyze the undervalued role of a symbolic medium as Latin literature as part of medieval and post-medieval contexts? And how, in turn, do our accounts and histories of these contexts \xe2\x80&#147; of medieval institutions, intellectual fields, and political sites \xe2\x80&#147; change in the light of these often ignored literary texts? What interests me, in short, is an intellectual and cultural history of medieval and post-medieval Latin literature and literary culture. So far, I have worked on a new account of medieval allegory in the Latin culture of the 12th century Renaissance (F.Bezner, Vela Veritatis, Brill 2005) and a genealogy of late-medieval historiography (F. Bezner, Von der Liturgie zur Geschichte, 2011). My current research interest is a re-interpretation of medieval Latin love poetry.</p>'

S'<p>Metazoan animals contain a bewildering variety of cell types whose forms are highly specialized for their functions.  Yet how cells adopt these diverse shapes and structures remains mysterious.  We are exploring this fundamental question of cell biology using a simple cell type \xe2\x80&#148; epithelia\xe2\x80&#148; in a genetically manipulable organism \xe2\x80&#148;Drosophila.  We have adapted targeted mosaic techniques to screen, in vivo and in an unbiased manner, for genes required for cells to assume the highly regular epithelial organization.  Cloning and characterization of these genes will reveal the mechanisms that regulate general cellular elements, such as the cytoskeleton and protein trafficking systems, in order to confer specific cellular architectures.  Since epithelial organization is compromised during the progression of mammalian malignant tumors, we also study how polarity disruption in the fly can promote the acquisition of cancer-like cellular properties.</p><p> Current research focuses on three questions:</p><p>1).  How is the polarity of epithelial cells regulated?</p><p>2).  How can misregulation of epithelial polarity led to tumorigenesis? </p><p>3).

S'<p>Research Interests</p><p>Professor Birgeneau\xe2\x80\x99s research is primarily concerned with the phases and phase transition behavior of novel states of matter. These include one and two dimensional quantum magnets, liquid crystals, physisorbed and chemisorbed surface monolayers, graphite intercalates, highly disordered magnets and lamellar CuO2 superconductors. He uses primarily neutron and x-ray scattering techniques to probe these systems.</p><p>Current Projects</p><p>Research follows two general themes. In the first, we are studying the properties of conductors and superconductors which are highly disordered and have reduced dimensionality. We deposit ultra thin films (as thin as one atomic layer) on cold substrates and study their conduction properties. Depending on various properties (thickness, temperature, material) these films can be metallic, insulating or superconducting. Furthermore, using electron beam lithography techniques developed in our laboratory, we can make these films as narrow as \xe2\x80\xb0 100\xc3\x85 (only 30 atoms across). This allows studies in both 2 dimensions and one dimension and puts us, at low temperatures, into the quantum mechanical regime. We are extending our work to include ferromagnetic materials.</p><p>The second area of study is on high Tc superconductors. Transport, Hall effect and electron tunneling measurements are employed to shed light on the mechanism responsible for superconductivity in these materials. In addition, we are investigating various device ideas employing these novel materials and the physics knowledge we obtain.</p><p>These studies incorporate graduate students in physics and materials science as well as undergraduates.</p>'

He has focussed his attention on dietary vegetables of the Brassica genus, including cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. It is now well established that diets rich in these vegetables are protective against hormone-dependent cancers, especially cancers of the breast and prostate glands. A group of indole-containing phytochemicals present in these plants is thought to contribute to their protective effects. He has shown that these indoles are converted by the acid of the stomach to chemicals that can activate or inhibit the function of nuclear hormone and xenobiotic receptors in human cancer cells. He has shown further that these indoles inhibit tumor metastasis by mechanisms that include increased immune response and blockage of blood vessel development in tumors. He seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms of action of these dietary substances with the aim of establishing the safety and efficacy of their use, and in so doing, to uncover new cellular regulatory pathways that may be  exploited in the control of cancer.</p>"

S'1. Protein interactions: The broad objectives of this research are to develop molecular-thermodynamic descriptions of the behavior of proteins in electrolyte solutions, to provide a framework for the design and optimization of protein separation systems, in particular protein separation by precipitation and protein crystallization. 2. DNA Electrophoresis: By observing single-molecule DNA-polymer entanglements directly as DNA electrophoreses through a capillary, we see that DNA/polymer collisions depend on the size and concentration of each species, and that multiple entanglements are possible. We have obtained data on the entanglement time as a function of the Porod-Kratky persistence length of the polymer (a measure of its stiffness), the collision frequency, and probability distribution of multiple entanglements. Using these data, a mechanistic model for DNA separations has been developed. It is able to predict DNA separations as a function of DNA size and polymer properties.3. Mammalian Cell Metabolism: While conditions for growth of bacterial, yeast and fungal systems are well established, much less is known about the growth, physiology and regulation of mammalian cells. In earlier work, we studied the environmental factors important in hybridoma growth, and developed an NMR-based method to follow intracellular metabolites in a hollow fiber bioreactor, placed in the bore of the NMR magnet. This has been continued to study glutamine metabolism in a murine hybridoma in detail. The understanding so obtained has been valuable in guiding industrial bioreactor operation for production of monoclonal antibodies and other products. The data and methodology developed now permits the rational design of balanced media, feed strategies and reactor operation to optimize antibody yields, and the approach is now common to most companies producing products from hybridoma, CHO or BHK cell lines.'

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; My current research interests focus mainly on how galaxies (including the Milky Way) form and evolve into the objects we see today and how the interstellar gas within galaxies is collected to form stars (including the Sun and Solar System).  In particular, I work on the earliest stages of star formation, as well as the dynamics, structure and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies.  Items of current active interest include trying to understand the nature of dark matter on galactic scales, particularly in dwarf galaxies and in the outer parts of the Milky Way.  I am also working on how the diffuse interstellar medium generates star-forming giant molecular clouds in different environments to unravel the basic physics of star formation on galactic scales.  We operate an array of twenty-three millimeter-wave radio telescopes as part of the CARMA Array, near Bishop, California.  We are building the Allen Telescope Array, a new type of radio interferometer of 350 dishes using commercial satellite dish technology to synthesize an aperture of 10,000 square meters for use at centimeter wavelengths. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>Irene Bloemraad (Ph.D. Harvard; M.A. McGill) studies the nexus between immigration and the political system. She is the author of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Becoming a Citizen: Incorporating Immigrants and Refugees in the United States and Canada</span> (University of California Press, 2006), which argues that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 lack of general integration policies has led to lower levels of citizenship among immigrants in the United States compared to Canada, and poorer outcomes in political incorporation. Professor Bloemraad\xe2\x80\x99s work suggests that any effective immigration policy must examine not just border control, but also integration and settlement policies.    Bloemraad is also the co-editor of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Civic Hopes and Political Realities</span> (RSF Press, 2008) about the civic inequalities that arise from unequal voice and visibility for immigrant organizations.  More recently, she co-edited <span style="text-decoration:underline">Rallying for Immigrant Rights</span> (University of California Press, 2011), the first book-length treatment of the 2006 immigration rallies that brought millions of people into the streets to march against legislation criminalizing undocumented status and for greater rights for those without papers and the foreign population more generally.  Current work looks at the relative effects of multiculturalism policy for various socio-political outcomes, the prevalence of immigrant nonprofits in suburbs and central cities, and the political socialization of people living in mixed legal status families.</p>'

Photochemistry and reaction dynamics experiments are aimed at providing an understanding of unusual isotope effects on the molecular scale. Global-scale field measurements and computer simulations are aimed at using stable isotopes as tracers of atmospheric chemistry and transport in today's atmosphere and of the exchange of gases between the atmosphere and biosphere on annual to millennial to billion year time scales from atmospheric, ice core, and rock measurements, respectively. This insight is extended to the early Earth and other planets through laboratory investigations of photochemical haze production and other atmospheric phenomena that could serve as significant regulators of climate and habitability.</p>"

S"<p>Experimental high energy astrophysics is the study of some of nature's most exotic creations. Steven Boggs's research is focused on developing and flying new gamma-ray telescopes to probe these environments from space. His primary interest is the detailed measurement of radioactive nuclei produced in the inner regions of a supernova explosion. Through their conversion of gravitational energy to nuclear energy, supernovae are the dominant engines of evolution in the Universe \xe2\x80&#147; controlling the production of the elements making up the world around us, the internal structure of galaxies, and the acceleration of cosmic rays. The radioactive nuclei produced in these explosions emit gamma-rays of characteristic energies for each isotope. These photons serve as sensitive probes of the detailed nuclear physics in the extreme conditions at the heart of a supernova, conditions far from the laboratory environment. These nuclei also allow us to discover and study the active sites of nucleosynthesis in our Galaxy.</p><p>Gamma-ray astrophysics also studies matter in even more exotic environments. We can't see a black hole by definition, but high energy particles \xe2\x80&#147; accelerated by the deep gravitational well \xe2\x80&#147; emit gamma-rays before disappearing over the event horizon. These photons directly reflect the complex physics of particle interactions in highly-curved spacetime. Neutron stars are the ultimate balancing act between modern and classical physics, with the baryon degeneracy pressure precariously halting the collapse of the star to a black hole. The study of gamma-ray emission from the surface of these objects allows us to probe the nuclear equation of state in extremely general-relativistic conditions.</p><p>A key to these studies is the development of gamma-ray instruments with high spectral resolution, so that Doppler effects on nuclear gamma-ray lines can be measured with high precision. My group is actively involved in the scientific planning and data analysis of several current and upcoming missions, as well as the development of novel gamma-ray laboratories for satellite and balloon flights.</p>"

These optical systems are designed for the sub-40-nm generations of pattern transfer technology. Operating at wavelengths between 11 and 14 nm, EUV projection optics must be fabricated and aligned to sub-nanometer tolerances. Measurements made at-wavelength enable these systems to reach diffraction-limited performance. With measured, sub-half-angstrom accuracy, EUV interferometry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has become one of the most accuracte optical system testing techniques ever developed. </p><p>Our group is currently working with its ninth EUV projection lens, with the potential for three times higher resolution that we have ever achieved.

S'My research group is a team of evolutionary biologists who are working at a major genome center (the Joint Genome Institute, i.e., JGI) off campus in Walnut Creek. The JGI produces about 65 million nucleotides of DNA sequence each day, and has drafted the complete genomes of a pufferfish, a tunicate, a diatom, a fungus, an algae, and about 100 prokaryotes, along with a significant portion of the human and mouse genomes. In progress are the genome sequences of a poplar tree, a frog, a choanoflagellate, two basidiomycetes and two oomycetes (including the one that causes "Sudden Oak Death"). Our Evolutionary Genomics Department operates in "academic style", including postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students, and guest researchers. We are working on many diverse research projects, including comparisons of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes (e.g., using gene rearrangements as a character for reconstructing evolutionary relationships) and Hox gene clusters (e.g., identifying the phylogenetic footprint of gene regulatory signals), and various comparative analyses of large-scale sequencing projects (e.g., addressing whether a whole genome duplication occurred at the base of the vertebrates). We have developed specialized software and databases and innovative laboratory techniques, such as the use of rolling circle amplification for studying organellar genomes. Some projects require significant molecular biology work, whereas others are primarily analytical. These projects address scientific questions ranging from issues of conservation biology and population genetics to reconstructing the deepest branches of the tree of life, all united by the theme of better understanding the evolution of organisms and their genomes.'

S'<p>We study the mechanisms and regulation of the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes and how this process is coupled to the cell cycle. Drosophila chromosomes and papilloma viral DNA provide unique opportunities to learn about chromosomal dynamics.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The chromosomes of eukaryotic cells contain cis-acting elements important for gene expression, replication, folding and structure, segregation and recombination. Among these regulatory sites only those involved in gene expression are well studied. </p><p>In eukaryotes each chromosome has many sites that serve as initiators for DNA replication in dividing cells. For multicellular eukaryotes the utilization of these sites changes during the course of development, and though the program of activation is poorly understood the process is known to affect both gene expression programs and chromosomal folding. </p><p>We have purified a complex of six polypeptides from Drosophila embryos that is called the Drosophila origin recognition complex (ORC), as it has structural and biochemical homologies to the well defined budding yeast ORC protein. This complex is part of the machinery that marks chromosomal DNA as sites "to be initiated" for replication. Presently we are developing biochemical and genetic assays to learn in detail how such temporal and spatial regulation for DNA replication initiation is achieved. We have cloned the genes encoding for each of the 6 subunits of the Drosophila ORC and are investigating the DNA binding specificities of the complex. It is well established that ORC persists on chromosomes throughout the cell cycle and in late mitosis/G1 the cdc6 protein associates with ORC creating a preinitiation complex of unknown complexity. We have cloned the Drosophila cdc6 gene and are testing the hypothesis that the activity of cdc6 is regulated by the cdk2:cyclin E kinase.</p><p> Most intriguingly we have observed that there is a very high density of ORC-2 protein associated with centric heterochromatin, a region of the chromosome likely to play an important role in chromosome folding, segregation and pairing. It is also known that this compact region of the chromosomes causes severe repression of "euchromatic" genes translocated into this environment, resulting in what is called position effect variegation (PEV). An abundant trans-acting protein known to be important for PEV and heterochromatin folding is called HP-1 and ORC interacts with HP-1. Further it is ORC-1 that has the strongest interaction with HP-1. We have proposed that ORC may have multiple functions in the cell cycle including coordination of folding and unfolding of DNA with the replicationcycle. These ideas are presently being tested through biochemical and genetic means.</p><p> DNA tumor viruses use host cell protein for their DNA replication, but encode for site specific DNA binding and helicase activity to sequester the cellular enzymes on their chromosomes and to unwind DNA. We have thus used these viruses to learn about specialized DNA replication initiation. Papillomaviruses oncogenically transform cells, and stably maintain the viral genome in these cells as multicopy nuclear plasmids. The DNA binding protein E2 brings viral plasmids to mitotic chromosomes to hitch-hike for segregation purposes during cell division.</p><p> All papillomaviruses encode for a 45 kd transcription factor called E2. E2 is a site-specific DNA binding protein, and 17 such binding sites are juxtaposed near five viral promoters in the prototype Bovine virus, BPV-1. The protein can stimulate transcription from four of these promoters, and in fact stimulates transcription of its own promoter. The protein also induces transcription of a viral promoter encoding for a trans-repressor. In G0 cells the repressor protein predominates, while in S phase the enhancer protein is induced. The positive factor is a paradigm eukaryote enhancer protein, as its cis sites can stimulate transcription from heterologous promoters in a distance- and orientation-independent manner.</p> The replication factor (called E1) encoded by these viruses is a 68 kd phosphoprotein. It binds ATP, and is a DNA helicase. The E1 protein binds to the origin of DNA replication directly, but is aided by E2. The E2 protein is thus an enhancer of both replication and transcription. Our work shows that E1 can form a complex with the E2 factor. The transcription factor thus serves as a molecular chaperone for the initiating helicase. We are presently engaged in structural studies to learn more about the mechanism of action of DNA helicases and how the activation domain of E2 interfaces with both the transcription and replication machinery.'

S'<p>The laws of quantum mechanics and those governing gravity seem incompatible, and will likely turn out to arise as limiting cases of a more fundamental theory. My research seeks to identify features of this elusive unified description of nature. String theory, in its present form, may be part of this description, and I continue to explore its structure.</p><p>Because string theory is difficult to apply to a realistic universe, it is important to extract key properties of quantum gravity that hold even in cases where string theory is presently inapplicable or intractable. This includes semiclassical results such as the quantum properties of black holes. More broadly, much evidence points to a surprisingly strong and counterintuitive relation between quantum-mechanical information and the geometry of spacetime, which has been recognized over the last decade.</p><p>The most general such relation currently known is the covariant entropy bound. This conjecture states that the area of spatial surfaces always exceeds the entropy of the matter present in adjacent spacetime regions. (The main content of this statement lies in the definition of "adjacent", which can be found in the references below.) This motivates the "holographic principle", which asserts that geometry and its matter content must arise from an underlying theory in such a way that this otherwise mysterious bound on entropy is guaranteed to hold from the start. Nowhere has this principle been realized more explicitly than in string theory (in the celebrated AdS/CFT correspondence), but it appears to apply in a far broader regime than what can currently be addressed by string theory.</p><p>Joe Polchinski and I have proposed an explanation of the mysterious accelerated expansion of the universe that has recently been observed. We showed that string theory predicts an enormous universe containing diverse regions (each still larger than the observed universe), including regions with the right amount of the "dark energy" to account for the above observations. Thus, what we think of as physical laws and constants of nature may be only one among many possibilities realized in what is now called the "string theory landscape".</p><p>In order to make predictions in this framework, it is important to begin mapping out the landscape (though it is not obvious that we already understand string theory well enough to get a representative sample). But it is also crucial to understand whether, and how, cosmological expansion in the early universe affects the probabilities for different kinds of low energy physics. This is related to an old and notoriously tricky question of how to define relative probabilities in an infinite, ever expanding universe.</p><p><b>Current projects</b></p><p>I am interested in understanding which known (or strongly believed) laws of physics can be regarded as consequences of the holographic principle. By identifying such implications one can hope to anticipate in more detail the manner in which familiar physics may arise from a more fundamental quantum gravity theory. In particular, I am exploring the so-called Bekenstein bound, which appears to relate to the emergence of non-gravitational physics. The question is whether it admits a sharp formulation, and if so, how it constrains physical laws.</p><p>I am also studying various aspects of the problem mentioned above: how to define the probabilities in the landscape of string theory.</p>'

S"<p>For more than thirty years, I have been immersed in the study of European and Latin American ethnography. My work has focused about equally on Spain and Mexico, although I have also written on the United States and Guatemala. During the course of my career, I have turned my attention to a wide variety of topics, including peasant society and culture, demographic anthropology (particularly issues revolving around migration and nuptiality), folklore (particularly jokes, banter, and humor of all kinds), the life course (including, most importantly, middle age), symbolism, ritual and religion, food and drink, and, most recently, visual anthropology. While abroad, I have lived and worked in both rural and urban settings and believe that, whether writing about Spain, Mexico, or the United States, my work is grounded in direct observations of a given people and reflects a sensitivity to regional, ethnic, class, and gender diversity. I believe strongly in the ethnographic field tradition.</p><p>  I am currently engaged in three topics of investigation. First is Mexico's Day of the Dead, which I write about from an historical and ethnographic perspective, and includes material from Latin America, Europe, and the U.S. Second is Alcoholics Anonymous in Mexico City, an intensive study over nearly two years of a single group of recuperating alcoholic men, all from working class, migrant backgrounds. Third is photography and anthropology, particularly the ways in which ethnographic photographs, intentionally or not, have communicated information and impressions about the Other. Most of my research on this last topic has been carried out in the context of Spain. </p>"

S'Work in my group will focus on transcriptional regulatory networks and their variation between members of a species.  When geneticists study a panel of DNA sequences from genetically distinct individuals, they often find that the genomes are riddled with differences, which can confer changes in mRNA expression level for thousands of genes.  These naturally occurring regulatory differences can impact medically and agriculturally important phenotypes; in its own right, the genetics of regulatory variation also serves as a rich model system for the study of complex traits.  The goal of my group will be to understand the molecular genetic principles that underlie regulatory variation, using computational and experimental approaches, principally in budding yeast.'

S"<p>The Brenner research lab has four key research interests involving computational and experimental genomics. <br /><br /><b>Gene regulation by alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. </b><br /> Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a cellular RNA surveillance  system that recognizes transcripts with premature termination codons and  degrades them. Several years ago, we discovered large numbers of  natural alternative splice forms that appear to be targets for NMD, and  we speculated that this might be a mode of gene regulation which we  termed RUST (regulated unproductive splicing and translation). This  seems to be confirmed by our finding that all conserved members of the  SR family of splice regulators have an unproductive alternative mRNA  isoform targeted for NMD. Strikingly, the splice pattern for each is  conserved in mouse and always associated with an ultraconserved or  highly-conserved region of ~100 or more nucleotides of perfect identity  between human and mouse. Remarkably, this seems to have evolved  independently in every one of the genes, suggesting that this is a  natural mode of regulation. We are using microarray data to explore the  pervasiveness of NMD in humans and in Drosophila, in collaboration with  Don Rio. As part of a modENCODE consortium, we plan to discover the  repertoire of cis-regulatory sites for alternative splicing in insects.  Future directions include detailing the regulators in the SR family and  exploring the evolution of this gene-expression regulation mechanism. <br /><br /><b>Prediction of protein function using Bayesian phylogenomics.  <br /></b> We are awash in proteins discovered through high-throughput  sequencing projects. As only a minuscule fraction of these have been  experimentally characterized, computational methods are widely used for  automated annotation. Unfortunately, these predictions have littered the  databases with erroneous information, for a variety of reasons  including the propagation of errors and the systematic flaws in BLAST  and related methods. In collaboration with Michael Jordan's group, we  have developed a statistical approach to predicting protein function  that uses a protein family's phylogenetic tree, as the natural structure  for representing protein relationships. We overlay on this all known  protein functions in the family. We use a model of function evolution to  then infer the functions of all other protein functions. Even our  initial implementations of this method, called SIFTER (statistical  inference of function through evolutionary relationships) have performed  better than other methods in widespread use. We are presently making  numerous improvements to the underlying SIFTER algorithm and enhancing  its ability to work on a wide range of data. We are collaborating with  the Joint Genome Institute and numerous protein databases to improve  annotation on a large scale. In collaboration with Jack Kirsch, we are  also experimentally validating the function predictions, with a focus on  the Nudix family. <br /><br /><b>Medical and environmental metagenomics; personal genomics. </b><br /> The Sorcerer II global ocean sampling project revealed the sequences  millions of new putative protein sequences, arguably doubling the known  repertoire of proteins. We collaborated with the Venter Institute in  the analysis of these proteins, understanding how they differ from those  previously seen, and discovering ancient relationships amongst them. We  are developing a new binning method that will help assign individual  sequence reads and contigs to clades, and we are collaborating with Jill  Banfield to apply this to the acid mine drainage community. Our initial  medical/metagenomics project is to understand the role of gut  microbiota in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease has long been known to be  associated with microbial communities in the intestine, but the exact  etiology has been unclear. By explicitly sampling these communities we  aim to better understand how they cause disease. In addition, by  studying how gut flora change during the withdrawal of long-term  antibiotics, we hope to gain insight into the action of these drugs on  the intestinal microbiota. We also have a longstanding interest in  personal genome interpretation and developing a genome commons. <br /><br /><b>Structural genomics and proteins complexes. </b><br /> Structural genomics ultimately aims to provide an experimental  structure or a high-quality model for every protein. We are involved in  maintaining the SCOP: Structural Classification of Proteins and ASTRAL  databases which are key resources for accessing and understanding  protein structure data. We therefore analyze structural genomics efforts  and guide their future directions. Using kernel methods and selected  features, we are building systems to recognize ancient protein  evolutionary relationships. We are also involved in the Protein Complex  Analysis Project, which uses mass-spectrometry, electron microscopy, and  electron tomography to understand protein complexes and their cellular  distribution.</p>"

S'<p>My research focuses on factors affecting the dynamics of animal populations. In particular, I am interested in how stage-specific processes, life-history traits and behaviors of individuals translate into effects on dynamics at the population level. My approach is to combine predictions from theoretical models with laboratory or field observations and experiments. I am especially interested in how population dynamics theory can be applied to species interactions in host-parasitoid or host-pathogen systems. I have worked on a range of different systems, including the biological control of California red scale by its parasitoid, Aphytis melinus, the interaction among the autoparasitoids of whitefly, and the impact of disease on insect population dynamics. </p><p>One of my ongoing projects involves studying the assemblage of parasitoid species that attack the gall-forming midge, Rhopalomyia californica, in coastal areas of California. My research on this system has both experimental and theoretical components, and centers on (1) the role of multiple parasitoid species in regulating midge populations, and (2) the effects of spatial processes and movement of individuals on the dynamics of the midge populations and on the coexistence of the multiple parasitoid species. In a new project in my lab we are attempting to understand and quantify the impacts of a newly-identified disease caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, on the spatially-fragmented populations of mountain yellow-legged frogs, Rana muscosa, in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. This project combines experimental studies of the details of the disease transmission process and dispersal behavior of the frogs, large-scale surveys, and spatially-explicit modeling. </p>'

S'<p>The research emphasis in the Exercise Physiology Laboratory is in the  area of metabolic adjustments to exercise. In recent years, we have  developed two working hypotheses: the "Lactate Shuttle," and the  "Crossover Concept." Research on the Lactate Shuttle is to elucidate the  pathways and controls of lactic acid formation and removal before,  during and after exercise. This work involves studies on humans and  animals, indirect calorimetry, isotope tracer technology, classic  arterial-venous difference measurements, lactate and glucose clamp  technology and muscle biopsies. As well, using in vivo studies and cell  culture techniques we seek to determine the factors that determine the  expression of lactate transport proteins and their cellular domains. In  the main, work is of a basic nature, but with others we seek to identify  the causes and develop treatment modalities for lactic acidosis in  persons suffering from HIV infection. Research on the Crossover Concept  is to describe and understand how the body selects combinations of fatty  acids, carbohydrates and amino acids for use during sustained exercise  and other conditions. Aspects of our work involve the effects of  exercise training, gender, age, and high altitude on substrate  utilization. Again, much of the work is of a basic nature, but results  have direct implications for the prevention and management of obesity in  youth and aging and the development of Tyoe 2 Diabetes. To support this  work, significant research collaborations with other laboratories in  the University of California and elsewhere have been established. These  arrangements offer students, post-doctoral fellows, research staff, and  visiting scientists the opportunity to work in an important and exciting  area of science.</p>'

She argues for a more permissive theory of rationality than is standardly assumed: her theory is a mathematical generalization of the orthodox theory. She is currently working on a book in this area, entitled Risk and Rationality. Further work in formal epistemology explores the questions of when an why one ought to stop one\xe2\x80\x99s search for further evidence.

S'<p>Bob Buchanan and his team focus primarily on thioredoxin-linked regulatory mechanisms in plants.</p><p>In the past several years, they have found that a thioredoxin system occurring in the cytosol of plant cells--the NADP/thioredoxin system--acts as a signal in seed germination. Thioredoxin, a small protein with a catalytically active disulfide group, is reduced early in germination by the NADPH generated by metabolic reactions of the seed. In the best understood case (wheat), thioredoxin reduces selected proteins of the seed endosperm, thereby leading to the mobilization of storage proteins and starch. Thioredoxin acts by reducing disulfide (S-S) groups of storage proteins, increasing their susceptibility to proteolysis. Thioredoxin also reduces enzyme inhibitor proteins, leading to their inactivation, and enzymes, leading to their activation. They currently are characterizing these and other regulatory events promoted by thioredoxin during germination.</p>'

S'<p>Budker\xe2\x80\x99s research interests are related to the study of violation of  discrete symmetries - parity and time reversal invariance - using the  methods of modern atomic physics. In particular, he has been involved in  exploring the rare earth elements - samarium, dysprosium and ytterbium -  where enhancement of P and P,T violating effects occurs due to close  proximity of states with opposite nominal parity. Experiments on P and  P,T violation involve many aspects and techniques of atomic physics, as  well as of linear and nonlinear optics and spectroscopy. Therefore, in  the broader sense, Budker\xe2\x80\x99s interests also include the following  subjects: precision spectropolarimetry, Doppler-free spectroscopy,  isotope shifts and hyperfine structure, spectral line broadening and  shift due to atomic collisions, linear and nonlinear magneto-optical  (Faraday) rotation, photo-ionization, multiphoton processes, lifetime  measurements, molecular spectroscopy, hypersonic beams, optical pumping,  radio-frequency resonance, and others. Budker and his group are also  studying applications of nonlinear optical phenomena in resonant vapors  and color centers in diamond to sensitive magnetometry.  <br /><br /><b>Current Projects </b><br /> The experiments currently being carried out include: <br /><br />- Experimental searches for P-violating effects in ytterbium.  Ultimately, this work may lead to a precision comparison of PNC effects  on different isotopic and hyperfine transitions.</p><p>- Investigation of nonlinear optical rotation and its applications to sensitive magnetometry and fundamental physics.</p><p>- Investigation of spin-relaxation properties of atoms in cryogenic buffer gas environment.</p><p>- Experimental tests of Bose-Einstein quantum statistics for photons.</p><p>- Experimental search for a possible temporal variation of the  fine-structure "constant" using radio-frequency electric-dipole  transitions in dysprosium.</p><p>Collaborators in this work include D. English, S. J. Freedman, A.  Pines (UCB Chemistry), S. K. Lamoreaux (LANL), M. Auzinsh (Latvia), W.  Gawlik (Poland), D. F. Kimball, C.-H. Li, A.-T. Nguyen, S. Rochester, J.  E. Stalnaker, A.

Lapierre, as well as several visitors and  undergraduate students. These experiments ideally suit the university  environment since, in spite of their potential to produce results  significant to our understanding of fundamental interactions, they are  relatively small-scale; thus they can be carried out in a small research  group and allow graduate and undergraduate students to actively  participate in all aspects of the experiment - from planning and design  and apparatus construction to data taking and analysis.</p>'

S'Michael Burawoy has studied industrial workplaces in different parts of the world -- Zambia, Chicago, Hungary and Russia -- through participant observation. In his different projects he has tried to cast light -- from the standpoint of the workplace -- on the nature of postcolonialism, on the organization of consent to capitalism, on the peculiar forms of working class consciousness and work organization in state socialism, and finally on the dilemmas of transition from socialism to capitalism. Most recently he has been studying the peculiar form of capitalism that has arisen in Russia: how the economy has been driven by the expansion of a range of intermediary organizations operating in the sphere of exchange (trade, finance, barter, new forms of money), and how the productive economy has been recentered on households and especially women. He refers to these processes of decline as "involution". He has developed theoretically driven methodologies that allow him to draw broad conclusions from his ethnographic research and case studies. Thus, most recently he coauthored a book with 9 graduate students on "Global Ethnography," that showed how globalization can be studied "from below" through participation in the lives of those who experience it. Throughout his sociological career he has engaged with Marxism, seeking to reconstruct it in the light of his research and more broadly in the light of historical challenges of the late 20th century.

Drosophila NINAC, the first class III myosin to be discovered, was initially identified as the defective gene responsible for causing photoreceptor degeneration in flies. We have cloned the first vertebrate homologues of NINAC to be identified, and shown that one of these, Myo3A, is selectively expressed in sensory neurons, including photoreceptors, where it is localized in microvillus-like processes that cup the base of the photopigment-bearing outer segment. Others have found that Myo3A defects lead to deafness in humans. We are now investigating the function of Myo3A by a variety of approaches, including heterologous expression in COS and HeLa cells, transgenic overexpression of Myo3A in Xenopus laevis photoreceptors, biochemical and molecular characterization of Myo3A kinase, motor, and tail domains, and mouse knockouts.</p><p>Fascin II is an actin bundling protein expressed uniquely in retina.

S'<p>Our research is focused on the structural characterization of nucleo-protein assemblies. The structure of chromatin and the global structure of protein-nucleic acid complexes relevant to the molecular mechanisms of control of transcription in prokaryotes are investigated using high resolution scanning force microscopy (SFM). This microscope, also known as Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) works by scanning a tip over the sample to sense the topography of the surface, thus functioning in much the same way than old record players. In addition, we are studying the elastic response of long linear polymers, the forces responsible for maintaining the tertiary structure of proteins, and the mechanical properties of molecular motors, using methods of single molecule manipulation such as laser tweezers and the SFM.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Our laboratory is involved in the study of the structural basis of protein-DNA interactions and their relevance in the processes of control of gene expression. In prokaryotes, and especially in eukaryotes, replication and transcription regulation involve the interaction of many specialized protein factors at regulator locations on the sequence to ensure correct sequence recognition, initiation, processivity, fidelity, and kinetic control. We wish to understand the multiple structural, spatial, and functional relationships among these regulatory factors. We are using the SFM as a high resolution tool to image initiation and elongation transcription complexes of E. coli RNA polymerase to characterize the spatial relationships between the enzyme and the DNA template. We are also beginning to investigate what structural changes are negotiated between RNA polymerase and chromatin during transcription. To this end, we are using the SFM to image complexes of nucleosome-containing DNA fragments carrying a promoter and a terminator upstream and downstream of the nucleosome positioning sequence, respectively. We plan to compare the behavior of various prokaryotic and eukaryotic polymerases as they transcribe through the nucleosome, to investigate whether transcription through a nucleosome is an inherent property of the core particle, or a property of each enzyme itself, and to characterize various intermediates of the translocation process. </p><p>Our laboratory is also working actively in the development of methods of single-molecule manipulation, including the use of SFM cantilevers, optical or laser tweezers, and magnetic beads to investigate the mechanical properties of macromolecules. In one project, we first tether a single protein molecule of T-4 lysozyme between a surface and the end of an SFM cantilever. We can then separate the surfaces in a controlled fashion to induce the mechanical unfolding of the molecule to characterize the nature, range, and strength of the forces that maintain its three-dimensional structure. Our objective is to carry out the unfolding of the molecule at equilibrium so as to obtain the potential energy function of the molecule as a function of the mechanical extension. This function represents the most complete description of the folded state of the protein. We plan to investigate how external conditions in the medium, i.e. temperature, denaturant concentration, etc., or point-directed mutations affect the shape of the potential energy function. Finally, our laboratory is also engaged in the study of DNA-binding molecular motors (RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase, etc.) using optical tweezers to investigate the dynamics of these molecules during translocation, as well as the effect of external force load and nucleotide tri-phosphate concentration on their power and force generation. In parallel, we are developing both microscopic (chemical ratchet-type) and phenomenological models of molecular motors which will be tested experimentally. We believe that single molecule experiments can provide a unique look into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the mechano-chemical conversion process in these protein machines.</p>'

More recently he has published books based on lecture series: the 1978-79 Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard published as The Compelling Image: Nature and Style in 17th Century Chinese Painting; the Franklin D. Murphy lectures for the University of Kansas published in 1988 as Three Alternative Histories of Chinese Painting; the Bampton Lectures given at Columbia published in 1994 as The Painter?s Practice: How Artists Lived and Worked in Traditional China; and the Reischauer Lectures delivered at Harvard published in 1996 as The Lyric Journey: Poetic Painting in China and Japan. A fifth lecture series, the Getty Lectures presented at the University of Southern California in 1994 as The Flower and the Mirror: Representations of Women in Late Chinese Painting, is presently being reworked for publication. Another book, completed and to be published in 2005, is titled Pictures for Use and Pleasure: Urban Studio Artists in High Qing China. A companion book is tentatively titled Chinese Erotic Painting: Supplement to Pictures for Use and Pleasure; this will be the first serious study of that subject.</p>"

S'<p>Our research group studies the fundamental properties and behavior of electrodes employed in high-performance rechargeable batteries and fuel cells. We synthesize and characterize new electrode materials in order to gain a fundamental understanding of the relationships among atomic and electronic structure, electrochemical performance, and long-term stability. We investigate fundamental means of enhancing material utilization and stability through modifications in the composition and structure of the electrodes, thereby increasing cell specific energy and lifetime.The performance of electrodes employed in fuel cells that directly react such fuels as methanol and ethanol is typically limited by slow electrochemical kinetics. The goals of our research performed on these electrodes are to synthesize new highly active electrocatalysts and characterize their kinetic and mechanistic behavior. By doing this, we identify electrode structures, electrocatalysts, and electrolyte compositions that lead to improved cell performance and lifetime. We rely heavily upon the use of advanced research tools, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) using synchrotron radiation (in collaboration with Prof. S. Cramer of UC Davis), to characterize the atomic and electronic properties of new electrode materials. We pioneered the use of photothermal deflection spectroscopy for the in situ characterization of electrochemical systems. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has been extended (in collaboration with Prof. J. Reimer of UCB) to the study of adsorbed species on electronically conducting electrode materials. This powerful technique is used for the atomic-level study of electrode materials for both batteries and fuel cells.</p>'

S'<p>My research interests lie in invertebrate behavior and ecology with much of my work centering on the behavioral ecology of stomatopod crustaceans, a group of tropical marine predators. The initial focus of this research was on how the evolution of potentially lethal weapons influenced stomatopod biology. These studies dealt mainly with communication and the function of aggression. More recent research has expanded to include the evolution of mating systems, interspecific communication, sensory ecology, how the raptorial appendages function, and larval biology. We are currently initiating studies on the genetic structure of stomatopod populations attempting to deduce the timing and pathways of dispersal. We are also using stomatopod populations as bioindicators to assess the health of tropical coastal habitats. I am also interested in the behavior of blue-ringed and other pygmy octopuses. We are currently studying the reproductive and aggressive behavior of several Indo-Pacific species.</p><p>Graduate students in my laboratory are not constrained to working on tropical marine invertebrates although an emphasis is maintained on invertebrate behavior and ecology. Current students are studying the impact of blast fishing on Indonesian coral reefs, stomatopod dispersal, monogamous mating systems in stomatopods, and octopus behavior and systematics. </p>'

We have made random insertions in the B. anthracis chromosome and are characterizing specific kinds of mutants that are less pathogenic or unable to absorb two different typing phages. We are constructing an integration vector--a plasmid that can insert any gene into the B. anthracis chromosome at a prophage attachment site. Such a vector will allow us to express particular antigens of B. anthracis at high levels, allowing the production of an improved vaccine. We are characterizing new phages of the B. cereus/thuringiensis/anthracis group, intending to use these phages and their lysins to control B. anthracis.</p>'

The BID lab is a 4000 sq ft space in the Hearst Memorial Mining Building with researchers from CS, ME, Education, Art Practice, SIMS and architecture. The program covers activity-oriented design of workspaces, products and information systems. </p><p>Livenotes is a practice and a technology for small-team collaborative learning in regular lecture classrooms. Livenotes uses wirelessly-networked PDAs or Tablet-PCs to allow students to take notes and annotate lectures collaboratively and in real-time. It leverages the power of small-group learning and integration of student, team-mate and lecturer perspectives (multi-vocality). </p><p>Flexonics is a new class of mechatronic devices that differ from their traditional counterparts in both fabrication and design. Our goal is to build fully functional mechatronic devices without assembly. These devices will integrate structural, mechanical, and electronic components during fabrication using an all inkjet printing process. Our focus is on high-performance dielectric actuators. </p><p>Multiview is a system for displaying multiple distinct views on a single screen. It can be used to provide spatially-faithful video-conferencing for natural eye contact and deixis. It can also be used to provide many views for walk-around inspection of architectural models or other 3D designs. Inter-image spacing ranges from many degrees to a fraction of a degree. </p><p>Ubicomp Privacy aims to develop new tools and techniques for privacy in a variety of situations including: collaborative work, smart spaces, and location-aware services. We are particularly interested in techniques that control how information is used, not just who has access to it. The goal is to develop provably strong (cryptographic and information-theoretic) protocols that are practically realizable. </p><p>Activity-Based Computing (ABC) explores the role of activities in shaping behavior. Activities are patterns of particular people, documents, tools, places, calendar times etc. Probabilistic models are used to build activity maps from low-level log data about email, document use, web browsing etc. Private computation is used so this log data is never exposed. ABC can be used for proactive document sharing, proactive retrieval, disambiguation, and other contextualization tasks. </p><p>Glaze is developing design methods for location-based services. The goal is to support rapid development and customization of location applications via technology probes, using a simple noun-verb programming interface. Our hypothesis is that LBSes should support small as well as large quanta of functionality, and design methods should support both. We also want to support a flexible "design hierarchy" from originating designer through other "customizers" through to the end user. </p><p>The Virtual Development Center (VDC) is a project sponsored by the Institute for Women in Technology and focused on design of technology by and for women.</p>'

I have conducted research with, and provided medical care to, forty different ethno-linguistic groups in fifteen different countries in Africa, Asia, Pacific Islands, South America, and North America. I collaborate with indigenous/local people to learn about their ethnoempirical and ethnotheoretical perspectives on medical and nutritional ethnobotany, ethnotaxonomy, ethnoecology, and ethnoepidemiology. This ethnobiological information is integrated into western empirical and theoretical frameworks to generate hypotheses and design and conduct experimental studies on medicinal and food plant species in physiology, pharmacology; molecular biology, systematics, and ecology. Population based public health and human clinical studies may be conducted to assess the contributions of ethnobotany to the medical and nutritional needs of local communities. My research on local/indigenous ethnoepidemiological perceptions of the ecology and evolution of causes and deterrents of human disease includes assessment of the interrelationships between of ecosystem ecology and human medical ecology. I work to develop systems through which the local/indigenous rural communities can be integrated into research projects and programs of ecosystem management, biodiversity monitoring, and human disease monitoring.</p>'

S'My research is concerned with investigating the neural basis of sensorimotor learning and control, and how we can use this knowledge in a brain-machine interface (BMI) context to improve the quality of life for the neurologically impaired. <p>BMI is about transforming thought into action, or conversely, sensation intoperception. This novel paradigm contends that a user can perceive sensory information and enact voluntary motor actions through a direct interface between the brain and a prosthetic device in virtually the same way that we see, walk or grab an object with our own natural limbs.  Proficient control of the prosthetic device relies on the volitional modulation of neural ensemble activity, achieved through training with any combination of visual, tactile, or auditory feedback. </p><p>BMI is also a powerful tool for modern systems neuroscience to study learning and adaptation in the brain. It allows visualization of neural circuit function through spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity while subjects perform behavioral tasks in both manual and brain control modes of operation. </p><p>At the BMI Systems Lab we use electrophysiological, behavioral and computational techniques to ask scientific questions about how the brain controls movement, as well as to achieve the technological milestones required to bring BMI to the clinical realm.</p>'

The international aid process provides a major focus of this work, largely because of its pervasive influence on development policy and practice in developing countries. Beyond the consideration of international and national level political and economic influences in local development policies, my work focuses on internal ethnic and socioeconomic conditions and the changing nature of the natural resource base itself as factors of recent historical change and future resource management options. Much of her research has involved \xe2\x80\x98indigenous\xe2\x80\x99 populations and their resources, from African agropastoral to coastal agro-fishing economic contexts, including in western Latin America and the southern Pacific region.'

S'<p>Molecular Basis for Protein Synthesis by the Ribosome: Protein synthesis is the universal mechanism for translating the genetic code into cellular function. The machine that carries out translation is the ribosome, a large RNA-protein complex whose structure is highly conserved in all kingdoms of life. Ribosomes, which are over 20 nm in diameter, interact with several different ligands and cofactors, including messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and proteins involved in the initiation, elongation, and termination of protein synthesis. Ribosomes are also dynamic entities; the small and large ribosomal subunits associate and dissociate during one full cycle of protein synthesis. We are exploring the process of protein synthesis by the ribosome. Key questions about the fundamental nature of translation remain unanswered. For example, &gt;b&gt;how does the ribosome read the genetic code? And how do certain antibiotics, so useful in reducing infections, cripple ribosomes?</p><p> We are using x-ray cyrstallographic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to unravel the mechanism of protein synthesis. To investigate translational fidelity, we are studying 70S ribosomal complexes trapped in the process of choosing the correct aminoacyl tRNA. We are also probing the mechanism by which the ribosome translocates tRNAs from one binding site to the next after peptide bond formation. Many antibiotics degrade the accuracy of translation or prevent tRNA shuttling on the ribosome. We are looking at the structure of the bacterial ribosome both in the absence and presence of these antibiotics to decipher their effects on protein synthesis.</p><p> Two different bacteria are being used as the sources of ribosomes. First, we are using a thermophilic bacterium, since "extremophiles" have proven to be good sources for ribosomes in structural studies of translation. In collaboration with Marat Yusupov, Gulnara Yusupova, and Harry Noller, we are studying the structure of a 70S-ribosome complex with two tRNAs and mRNA at a nominal resolution of 5.5 \xc3\x85 (Fig. 1). We have modeled the ribosome based on the recently available atomic-resolution structures of the 30S and 50S subunits [N. Ban et al. (2000) Science 289, 905; B. Wimberly et al. (2000) Nature 407, 327]. The state of tRNA binding in this structure is probably that immediately prior to or immediately after peptidyl transfer. In collaboration with Professor Al Dahlberg and Dr. Steven Gregory at Brown University, we have made mutations in the ribosome which confer resistance or dependence on the antibiotic streptomycin. Streptomycin binds to ribosomes and leads to error-prone protein synthesis. The streptomycin resistance and dependence mutations in the ribosome do not disrupt streptomycin binding, yet are able to counteract the error-inducing effects of the antibiotic. We are looking at the structure of the intact mutant ribosomes, both in the absence and presence of the antibiotic, to decipher its effects on translation.</p><p> More recently, we have begun to study the structure of the ribosome from the common bacterium Escherichia coli. Many decades have been spent to develop both the biochemical and genetic tools to study protein synthesis in E. coli. We suspect, therefore, that ribosomes from this organism may provide the best means for determining the atomic-resolution structure of the ribosome in all stages of protein synthesis. In our preliminary work, we have obtained at least three crystal forms of 70S ribosomes from E. coli, and are in the process of determining the structure of the ribosome in each crystal form. Our crystallographic work with E. coli ribosomes is presently focused on the mechanism of tRNA selection, a process that involves mRNA, aminoacyl tRNA, elongation factor Tu, and the hydrolysis of GTP.</p>'

S'Research in the Cerny group centers on the study of the properties and decay schemes of exotic proton-rich nuclei and on the search for new modes of radioactive decay, such as two-proton radioactivity. Professor Cerny\'s experimental program is concentrated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\'s 88-Inch Cyclotron and utilizes its many high-energy beams of ions ranging from protons to uranium. Current research projects of the group involve high resolution determinations of decay schemes of beta-delayed proton and two-proton emitters; accurate mass measurements of nuclei far from stability; and spectroscopic studies involving the detection of unbound nuclei such as 2He, 11N and 14F as reaction products. The group also uses the newly-completed Berkeley Gas-Filled Separator (BGS) to search for new proton- or alpha-particle emitting isotopes in the region of the Chart of Nuclides near lead. Recently the Cerny Group has lead the effort to develop a radioactive ion-beam capability at the 88" Cyclotron via the Berkeley Experiments with Accelerated Radioactive Species (BEARS) initiative. Short-lived radioactive isotopes are produced at the LB Biological Isotope Facility, transported as a gas through a 300 meter-long capillary to the 88" Cyclotron, injected into the main ion source and accelerated as an ion beam. Upon completion of the BEARS activity-handling system in August 1999, this coupled-cyclotron facility produced 1x108 11C ions/sec on target for nuclear experiments. As of August 2001, BEARS also provides a beam of 7l second 14O. Studies in nuclear astrophysics and on nuclei far from stability are commencing with this new capability. We have completed the first set of experiments and are currently developing new detector systems for studying exotic nuclear reactions made possible by BEARS.'

S"<p>Professor Chandler's research in theoretical chemistry is concerned with a variety of phenomena in complex systems, especially condensed matter. He has created the basic and standard theories of liquid structure.  He has also developed the statistical mechanical techniques for analyzing chemical equilibrium and chemical dynamics in liquids.</p><p> He and his students study both classical and quantum mechanical problems employing the methods of statistical mechanics to understand liquids, solutions and self-assembly. These methods include field theories, perturbation theories and numerical simulation. Exploiting analogies between various disciplines, his students learn the theories of polymers as well as electrons, and theories of solvation as well as chemical dynamics. They become facile with both analytical and numerical techniques. </p><p>In recent research, Professor Chandler and his students have extended their group's earlier work on the molecular theory of hydrophobicity - the nature of liquid water organization in the vicinity of oily species.  Hydrophobicity is believed to play a central role in the formation of biological structures because the microscopic segregation of oily and aqueous components is a most common facet of lipid and protein assemblies.  Now, with emphasis on extended hydrophobic surfaces, he and his students have shown that hydrophobicity can induce phase transitions and powerful inter-surface interactions over lengths scales that are very large compared to typical microscopic distances.</p><p> During the last few years, he and his students have developed a technique of transition path sampling, permitting the computational study of rare but important events without preconceived knowledge of transition states.  Process under investigation include weak acid dissociation in water and in clusters and the folding of solvated polymers.  Other topics of study in his current research group are the theory of self-assembly in liquids such as the formation of membranes and vesicles and the treatment of dielectric response in strongly disordered systems. </p>"

S"George Chang works on foodborne illness and the microbiological safety of our food and water supply (water is, after all, a major food and nutrient). Right now we are witnessing a revolution in food microbiology, as people devise faster and more specific methods for monitoring food and water. Professor Changs's group is contributing to this revolution in several ways. First they have identified some major flaws in the MUG test, a technique introduced in the 1980s for detecting fecal contamination. They have also figured out how to combine the classic fecal coliform and indole tests to make a brand-new fecal E. coli test. Most recently the group has discovered how to make a convenient membrane filter test for E. coli and total coliform bacteria in drinking water, a goal that has eluded everyone for decades. Their style of approaching these problems is simple and straightforward: learn as much about the intermediary metabolism of the target organism as possible, go to the lab bench and plate out the bacteria, and then watch very carefully. The living, growing bacteria teach us more biology than dozens of textbooks could."

At the interface of chemistry and biology, we use organic synthesis and/or protein engineering approaches to create new chemical tools for studying biological problems relevant to human health and disease. These novel imaging and proteomics probes are utilized to discover and study new biology, with applications spanning signal transduction, neurobiology, cancer, stem cell biology, and infectious diseases. On the inorganic side, we synthesize and characterize new earth-abundant, first-row transition metal complexes for energy catalysis and green chemistry applications. The group philosophy is to create new molecules for a targeted function and apply our novel chemistry to problems of broader interest. A selection of current project areas is described below.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Bioinorganic Chemistry</span>: Metals in Neurobiology and Infectious Diseases.The chemistry of the brain offers a grand challenge for a molecular understanding of memory and senses like sight, smell, and taste, as well as developing new therapeutics for stroke, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s. We are developing new fluorescent sensors, MRI contrast agents, and activity-based protein probes for imaging metals to study neurotransmission, neurodegeneration, and neural stem cell function in living cells and animals. Analogous new chemical tools are being developed to study the roles of metals during immune response in major third world infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis as well as in common E. coli. and Salmonella infections.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Chemical Biology</span>: New Chemical Tools for Studying Signal Transduction. Owing to their small size and greater tunability, chemical probes can offer a precise and powerful approach to study biology at the cell and organism level with minimal perturbation to the native system compared to traditional biological methods. We are creating new fluorescent and bioluminescent sensors for imaging small signaling molecules like hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen sulfide, as well as developing new bioorthogonal reactions for proteomic mapping of post-translational modifications and activity-based protein profiling.

S'<p><i><strong>Variable All-Optical Buffer:</strong></i>, A controllable variable optical memory is one of the most critically sought after components in optical communications and signal processing.  In such a buffer, optical data would be kept in optical format throughout the storage time without being converted into electronic format.  The buffer must be able to turn on to store and off to release optical data at a very rapid rate by an external command.  This seemingly simple function to this date has never been realized, in spite of much previous research.</p><p>Recently, we proposed a novel approach of making an all-optical buffer in semiconductors. Our basic idea centers on making a medium that can controllably slow down optical transmission such that it is effectively an optical memory.  By controlling the group velocity reduction factor, the memory storage time can be adjusted to desired values.  Our approach involves engineering both the material and waveguide dispersion curves.  The former can be most effectively achieved with the use of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) under a mechanism called the electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT), whereas the latter with periodic structures such as gratings or micro-resonators.</p><p><i><strong>High Speed Diode Lasers Using Optical Injection Locking:</strong></i>, The goal of this program is to investigate diode laser technologies to achieve very high speed (&gt;40GHz), low power dissipation, small form factor, and potentially very low cost.  The resulting device would facilitate very high speed chip-to-chip interconnects, which could, in turn, enable faster and more functional processors.   In addition, these transmitters could serve as a catalyst for rapid deployment of free space communications for access networks and bring the most sought-after upstream broadband access to vast number of schools and homes.  They will be useful for communications among aircrafts, exploration ships, satellites, and other moving vehicles, where power consumption and weight are critical and bandwidth requirement is exceedingly high.</p><p>In this program, we investigate optical injection locking as a mechanism to improve laser transmission characteristics.  We use a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) as the platform since its topology facilitates cost-effective manufacturing, packaging and testing.  We use a CW laser to optically injection lock a VCSEL to enhance its frequency response.  The injected CW source increases the stimulated emission recombination, resulting a faster and more effective RF modulation response.  We observed drastic reduction in chirp for large signal digital modulation.  In addition, a factor of three improvements in resonance frequency was achieved with a flatter modulation response and a higher modulation efficiency improvement.  A record large tolerance range in wavelength detuning and alignment tolerance were also reported.</p>'

S'<p>We are interested in the mechanisms of synapse formation during development and synapse modification in plasticity. In particular, we aim to decipher protein composition of the synapse and understand how interactions among these proteins support and regulate synapse function.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>At postsynaptic specializations, neurotransmitter receptors are clustered and tethered down by a large array of synaptic proteins. By focusing on the glutamate receptor family, we are attempting to understand the mechanisms of receptor targeting during synapse formation and plasticity. The life of a glutamate receptor involves its synthesis in ER, sorting through the Golgi network, insertion into the plasma membrane, targeting to synapses, internalization into endosomes, recycling to surface, and eventually, degradation in lysosomes. In the case of AMPA receptors, a number of receptor-interacting PDZ proteins, such as GRIP, ABP, PICK1, SAP-97 and Stargazin/PSD-95, have been implicated in different steps of these processes. However, a clear delineation of a role for each protein at a given step of AMPA receptor trafficking has not been achieved. By combining biochemical and electrophysiological approaches and using Xenopus oocytes as well as organotypic slice culture preparations, we hope to uncover the molecular mechanisms of receptor trafficking.</p><p> An ultimate test to our knowledge of the synapse is to actually build one. When transfected into non-neuronal cells, synaptic adhesion molecules (such as neuroligin) are able to induce morphological and functional presynaptic differentiation and form a synapse-like structure with passing axons from co-cultured pontine explants. Our goal is to use this system to build a postsynaptic structure. We have found that when AMPA receptor subunits, PSD-95 and stargazin are co-transfected into HEK cells, they form distinctive patch-like surface clusters that are not observed when only two of the three proteins are introduced. Importantly, neuroligin, the key molecule for inducing presynaptic innervations and transmitter release, also binds to PSD-95. Taken together, these findings suggest that if we transfect AMPA receptor subunits, PSD-95, stargazin and neuroligin together into HEK cells, the AMPA receptors may preferentially cluster at sites opposing differentiated presynaptic terminals originating from nearby pontine explants, forming an "artificial synapse." We are establishing such a system and examining its structural and electrophysiological properties. The postsynaptic proteins introduced will not be limited to the onesmentioned above. Cell lines that stably express a number of essential proteins (i.e. neuroligin, PSD-95 and GluR1) will be established to enhance the feasibility of introducing additional proteins. Once a rudimentary synapse is constructed, we will be able to study receptor-synaptic protein interaction from a new angle - putting the synapse together, one piece at a time. </p>'

S'<p>Renee Chow is Associate Professor of Architecture and Urban Design.   Her work focuses on the intersection between architecture and its  locale. One problem for contemporary design is to link the structure of  the city and landscape with its individual pieces\xe2\x80&#148;to design how each  affects and is affected by the other. In making pieces of our  cities\xe2\x80&#148;highways and streets, parks and buildings\xe2\x80&#148;our current  architectural culture too often strives for a degree of formal autonomy  from surrounding circumstances. The experience of a city becomes a  cacophony of competing markers. The experience of the textures of  neighborhoods, the orientation of districts, and the collective  practices of dwelling disappear as our design practices increasingly lose the tools to make them.</p><p>To address this challenge, Chow\xe2\x80\x99s practice and research use a lens of field relations to reveal how urban forms connect to build unique extended environments. Detailed observations of urban conditions are unlayered to reveal the continuous attributes of fields that build particular places. These attributes are relayered in relational configurations that integrate the emergence of new forms -- with multiple players and over time. These new urban tools have been used in both the American suburbs and in rapidly changing Chinese cities. The most recent project has just been completed for the Tianjin Urban Planning and Design Institute to study the revitalization of a 500 acre historic area in the center city.</p><p>Professor Chow is author of <i>Suburban Space: The Fabric of Dwelling</i> which illustrates potentials of single  family houses when designed as fields; she is currently finishing a  manuscript on Chinese urbanism. She is also principal of Studio Urbis, an architecture  and urban design practice formed in collaboration with her partner,  Thomas Chastain. Projects include single and multi-family residences,  institutional and commercial projects as well as urban and community  specific development plans and studies.</p>'

For this purpose, computational methodologies that can be used to propagate information across multiple temporal and spatial domains are being developed and applied to study various biomolecular systems. Current research projects include the allosteric modulation of membrane receptors, mechanical responses of biomolecules, effects of shear on protein conformation and protein-protein interactions, protein stability at oil/water interfaces, and the self-assembly of biomaterials.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>One of my main interests is in the development, noise limitations and applications of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) made from both low-transition temperature (Tc) and high-Tc superconductors. I am particularly intrigued by quantum-limited detectors. The applications include reading out of potential superconducting \xe2\x80\x9cqubits\xe2\x80\x9d, axion detectors, sensing of magnetically-tagged biomolecules, nuclear magnetic resonance and nondestructive evaluation. I am also involved in research on arrays of nanometer-sized arrays of tunnel junctions which display charging effects arising from the Coulomb blockade of single electrons or electron pairs.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p>A possible qubit for quantum computation consists of a tiny superconducting loop interrupted by a nanometer-sized Josephson tunnel junction. The two macroscopic quantum states are represented by a trapped magnetic flux in the \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d state or \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d state, represented by anticlockwise and clockwise supercurrents in the loop, respectively. This system is described by a two-well potential; operation of the device as a qubit requires it to oscillate between the two quantum states. This oscillation can in principle be detected by an ultrasensitive SQUID, provided the backaction can be reduced sufficiently. A major effort is under way to observe these macroscopic quantum oscillations.</p><p>We have recently developed a \xe2\x80\x9cmicrostrip SQUID amplifier\xe2\x80\x9d which involves a resonant input circuit to couple magnetic flux efficiently into the SQUID. At frequencies around 0.5 GHz and at 20 mK, the noise is within a factor of two of the quantum limit. At this frequency, the energy resolution is 40 times better than that of any other amplifier. A major application is in a search for cold, dark matter -- the reading out of signals from the axion detector at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p><p>We have spent several years developing SQUID magnetometers based on high-Tc superconductors and operating in liquid nitrogen at 77 K. Our primary interest has been in understanding the noise limitations of these devices. We have received two patents for magnetometers involving laser-deposited multilayer structures. Although not quite as sensitive as their low-Tc counterparts, these high-Tc SQUIDs are now sufficiently sensitive for a wide variety of applications. This technology has enabled us to construct a \xe2\x80\x9cSQUID microscope,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a SQUID at 77 K, mounted below a thin window, is typically only 15 \xc2\xb5m from room temperature specimens. Using this instrument, we have developed a novel immunoassay technique that involves tagging an antibody or antigen with a superparamagnetic nanoparticle. Another potential application includes measurements on molecular motors labeled with a ferromagnetic nanoparticle and of the unwinding of DNA or nanotubes similarly tagged.</p><p>We have developed a low-Tc SQUID-based spectrometer for measurements of ultralow-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Unlike the conventional tuned-circuit detection scheme, the SQUID retains its sensitivity at arbitrarily low frequencies. This fact, together with the use of a prepolarization technique and a novel pulse sequence, enables us to detect NMR at frequencies down to a few hertz with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. A particularly exciting potential application of this new technique is high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in magnetic fields even lower than that of the earth.</p><p>A rather different area of research is the investigation of one-dimensional arrays of nanometer-sized tunnel junctions deposited on a GaAs substrate containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Of particular interest are the effect of changing the dissipation on this model quantum system in situ, and its implications for both phase transitions and decoherence of possible qubits.</p>'

We have taken advantage of Sxl\'s unique features to explore a variety of different research questions, with an increasing emphasis on evolution as understanding of insect sex-determination mechanisms has progressed.  In anticipation of retiring at the end of June, 2012, I am currently winding down my lab and hence am no longer accepting advisees.

In one of the first events directed by the zygotic genome, the double dose of "X-chromosome signal element" (XSEs) gene products in chromosomal females (XX) activates the "establishment" promoter of Sxl in the soma.  The single dose of XSE products in males (XY) is not sufficient to do so.  The pulse of SXL protein thereby generated only in diplo-X animals engages a positive feedback loop for the productive splicing of transcripts originating from the Sxl "maintenance" promoter, which becomes active in both sexes as the establishment promoter shuts down, and remains active thereafter.  The full-length SXL proteins thereby generated elicit all aspects of female development, including X-chromosome dosage compensation, by interacting with the RNA products of downstream regulatory gene targets such as transformer (tra).  Because males lack that initiating pulse of Sxl protein, they never engage the splicing feedback loop, hence never make feminizing SXL proteins, and thus develop male by default.  In germ cells, Sxl is required both for oogenesis and meiotic recombination (a female-specific process in Drosophila), but little is known about its regulation and functioning in that cell type beyond the fact that cell-cell communication between somatic and germ cells in the gonad is important.<br />(1) An unanticipated branch in the regulatory pathway controlling female nervous system development:  It had been thought that Sxl directed all aspect of female somatic differentiation through its effects on tra.  However, we discovered that some aspects of nervous system development required for ovulation are controlled by Sxl, but not by its working solely through tra. This "tra-insufficient feminization" pathway is exciting both because it involves an aspect of fly behavior that is comparatively simple and because this aspect of behavior is particularly amenable to genetic analysis.  We speculate that this aspect of Sxl function may represent an ancestral, female-specific role that Sxl had when it was regulated by tra, before it became a regulator of tra. <br />(2) A new member of the "Sxl autoregulation facilitator" (SAF) group of genes:  Simply by simultaneously increasing the dose of Sxl and the SAF gene sans-fille, we could induce female expression of Sxl in the male germline and thereby disrupt spermatogenesis without killing the males.  A genetic selection for suppressors of this sterilizing effect identified a new SAF gene that we named helper of Sex-lethal (hsx).  A striking feature of the SAF group that hsx shares is its property of facilitating Sxl positive autoregulation in both the germline and soma (most genes with which Sxl interacts are different in these two cell types).  Although we failed in our goal of identifying Sxl regulators that are germline-specific, our recent generation of a new class of Sxl+ duplication has allowed us to design a more powerful suppressor screen that has a better chance of achieving this goal. <br />(3) Structure-function studies of Sxl in the germline: We have exploited a variety of mutant Sxl alleles to compare and contrast the roles of various aspects of SXL structure in the germline vs. soma.  Among the more informative findings are (1) that the N-terminus unique to SXL proteins controlling somatic sex determination is not required for Sxl germline activities; and (2) that the germline functioning of a mutant Sxl allele that is only defective with respect to its functioning in that cell type can be restored by a single SXL amino acid substitution, but that suppression of the germline defect comes at the expense of somatic functionality.</p>'

S"Cynthia E. Coburn uses the tools of organizational sociology to understand the relationship between instructional policy and teachers' classroom practices in urban schools. She has studied these issues in the context of state and national reading policy, attempts to scale-up innovative school reform programs, and district-wide professional development initiatives. Current projects include a study of the role of school leaders in mediating between reading policy and teachers' classroom practice. The study brings an analysis of power, authority, and knowledge into scholarship on teachers' interpretation of instructional policy. She also co-directs a cross-case study of innovative efforts to reconfigure the relationship between research and practice for school improvement. As part of that project, she studies an effort to redesign school districts to foster evidence-based practice and decision making. Finally, she is engaged in a study of the role of teachers' social networks in the scale-up of ambitious mathematics curricula in two urban districts."

S"I am a cultural anthropologist whose primary field is the critical study ofmedicine, health, and the body. I wrote <i>No Aging in India</i>, a book onAlzheimer's disease, the body and the voice in time, and the cultural politics ofsenility. I am now working on two projects. <i>India Tonite</i> examines homoeroticidentification and representation in the context of political and market logics inurban north India. <i>The Other Kidney</i> engages the nature of immunosuppressionand its accompanying global traffic in organs for transplant. It is part of a largercollaborative project with my colleague Nancy Scheper-Hughes. <p>These different projects are united in several ways. They all constitute ananthropology of complex objects, working through a variety of meta-epistemologicalapproaches in social theory, philosophical anthropology, science studies, andmedical anthropology to linking talk about nature, about political economy, andabout the obvious, the ground of culture. They all confront the question ofethnographic form, less as an interpretive or political gesture than as anexperimental apparatus for learning something new. And they all operate in intimaterelation to a figure of failed sovereignty. </p><p>Most of my work has been in India. I have studied and had fellowships in Delhi andSimla. My fieldwork has been primarily in urban north India (Banaras, Lucknow,Allahabad), in the metropoli (Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore), andin parts of rural U.P., Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. I have also worked in theUnited States and most recently in Malaysia. </p><p>Before undertaking a Ph.D. in anthropology I pursued work in the comparative studyof religion (with a focus on Hindu and Jewish thought) and then in medicine (with afocus on geriatrics and psychiatry). At Berkeley, I teach both in Anthropology andin the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. </p>"

S"<p>Professor Cohen's research addresses air pollution and climate change by studying connections between molecular reactions, ecosystem processes, and regional or global scale atmospheric phenomena (e.g thunderstorms, megacities, long-range transport). Specific target questions include:</p><ul><li>What chemical reactions control whether ozone is locally produced or consumed in the atmosphere?</li><li>How are nitrogen oxides transformed in the atmosphere and by what mechanisms do they exchange with the biosphere? How can we verify that changes in greenhouse gas emissions are occurring as predicted?</li><li>How do these regional processes affect the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere on a global scale? How do water isotopes move within the earth-atmosphere system?</li><li>Do the kinetics of condensation and evaporation affect cloudiness?</li></ul><p>These questions guide an interdisciplinary chemical/geophysical approach to exploring the structure and dynamics of the earth-ocean-atmosphere system.</p><p>Current projects are aimed at establishing dense networks of sensors for assessing changes in NOx and CO2 emissions, at advancing our ability to interpret measurements of NO2 made from space-based spectrometers and providing observations that allow accurate projection of the dates when levels of ozone and aerosol in various U.S. cities will return to natural levels.</p>"

S'<p>At any given time, my group and I are involved in research on a variety of subjects in condensed matter physics. Because of the breadth of this field, it is important to expose graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to a wide spectrum of problems. A broad view is also important because new breakthroughs occur in different subareas of this field. Since the research projects are chosen because of their inherent scientific importance, we are sometimes working directly with experimentalists and at other times developing new formalisms and techniques to understand or solve a problem. We are often trying to predict the existence of new materials and attempting to explain or predict new properties of condensed matter systems.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Some of our current research is in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The major systems under investigation are nanotubes, C60-based materials, large molecules like C36, nanocrystals or quantum dots, clusters, onions, cones, horns, nanowires, etc. The quantum nature of these systems makes them physically interesting and provides a variety of possible applications.</p><p>There is almost always some work going on in my group on superconductivity, semiconductors, and predicting new materials. Currently, except for the copper oxides, the highest temperature superconductors are MgB2 and C60 (using gated electrodes)\xe2\x80&#148;we are trying to explain the properties of these systems using novel applications of BCS theory. For semiconductor research, there are ongoing studies of electronic, optical, and high pressure properties of these systems.</p><p>Other studies recently completed focussed on quantum computation in the ground state, superluminal velocities, and the limits on the strength of materials.</p>'

S'Fred Collignon, Ph.D., FAICP, is Associate Professor of City and Regional Planning and is the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs for the College of Environmental Design. He was Friesen Chair for Urban Studies from 2004 until June 2006. A certified planner, Professor Collignon was awarded FAICP status for career contributions to city planning by the American Institute of Certified Planners in 2002. He works with undergraduate students in Urban Studies, professional MCP students, and with Ph.D. students in his teaching and research supervision., , Professor Collignon is principally noted for his professionally focused research and planning activities. He organized the firm Berkeley Planning Associates with several other Berkeley faculty in 1972, and served as the CEO for twenty-four years. The firm became one of the largest planning firms in the U.S. doing work in more than twenty states a year. Most of Professor Collignon\'s research publications are listed with "Berkeley Planning Associates" as the author. He sold the firm in 1995 to his staff as an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP). He has also worked as a Legislative Analyst for Congressman Clarence Long (Md.), as a Program Analyst for what is now the Office of Management and Budget in the President\'s Office, and as a Senior Economist at Abt Associates in Cambridge. He holds a B.A. summa cum laude from Columbia, where he majored in history, economics, and government, and a Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government from Harvard., , Professor Collignon has served as Department Chair for City and Regional Planning almost nine years over different periods since his arrival. At some time or other, he has taught in every concentration in the department with the exception of urban design. His research, professional work, and teaching has included the areas of social policy planning, program evaluation and policy analysis, land use planning and regulation, regional planning, community building and development, infrastructure, economic development, housing, transportation, public health planning, public and nonprofit sector management and program implementation, and public finance. He has directed or been the principal investigator for national program evaluations of several Federal employment programs, of community-based care for the aged, of infrastructure management, social programs focusing on child abuse and neglect, independent living centers for those with disabilities, regional development programs based on growth centers, and policies aimed at redirecting or alleviating problems associated with migration of the poor from rural areas to cities. He has participated in several national evaluations of Federal housing programs and policies, Federal poverty programs, and the programs leading to Model Cities. He completed the first Federal policy study of containerization in freight transportation, participated in regional planning studies for the Canadian Maritime provinces and many different U.S. states and regions and growth policy/program studies for different cities, and completed a study for the Australian government of new technology town governance and finance. The roles of which he is most proud include those of helping Berkeley\'s Center for Independent Living and helping shape the 1973 Rehabilitation Action and the later ADA legislation for those with disability. He directed from 1971-76 the nation\'s first center for program evaluation and policy analysis of disability programs, based at the Institute of Urban and Regional Development here at Berkeley., , His most recent research has included the following: analyses documenting a huge shortage of urban recreational space in most U.S. cities due to increasing recreational activity of women and the loss of active recreational space to development and passive recreational parkland; a comparative study of the metropolitan planning activity by states in Australia; analysis via comparative study of cities in Europe, Australia and the U.S. of the use of hallmark events (such as the Olympics or Worlds\' Fairs) for urban redevelopment; and an examination of the reasons behind the increasing financial dependence on public assistance of those with disability, especially the young., , On campus, Professor Collignon also serves as Co-Chair of the Disability Studies Program, and has served for the past eleven years as the Faculty Adviser for Community and National Service to the Undergraduate Vice-Chancellor (overseeing programs involving some 5000 undergraduate volunteers annually), and as the Chair of the Chancellor\'s Faculty Advisory Committee for Service Learning. He has held the UC President\'s Chair for Undergraduate Education, awarded in competition across all the campuses.

S'<p>The laboratory studies ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), with particular focus on thereverse transcriptase telomerase. Telomerase adds one strand of telomeric DNA simplesequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template within its integral RNAcomponent. This de novo telomeric repeat addition is required to balance the loss ofrepeats that occurs with incomplete replication of linear chromosome ends byconventional DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Cells that do not produce activetelomerase, including most cells in multicellular organisms, lose telomeric repeatswith each round of cell division. When telomeric repeat number reaches a criticalminimum, short telomeres somehow signal for cell death or an irreversibleproliferative senescence. Cancer cells escape this limitation by activatingtelomerase. We study telomerase both in vitro, to understand the structure andbiochemical mechanisms of this essential eukaryotic reverse transcriptase, and invivo, to define its cellular roles and regulations. We are also investigatingstructure and function in other RNPs with cellular activities that, like telomerase,depend intimately on both protein and non-coding RNA.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>We are investigating telomerase in the ciliate Tetrahymena and human cells usingtechniques from structural biology and enzymology to cell biology and genetics. Someof these studies focus on the protein-nucleic acid interactions that establish theunique features of the telomerase enzyme. For example, the telomerase RNP mustdistinguish a short sequence within the much larger telomerase RNA as the templatefor reverse transcription. Also, as substrates for elongation, telomerase must berecruited to authentic chromosome ends but not random DNA breaks. Both of thesespecificities can be partially recapitulated with recombinant enzyme and are likelyto be enhanced by as yet uncharacterized factors as well. We are using recombinanttelomerase proteins and RNAs to study the roles of the known molecules. We are alsousing affinity purification techniques to identify new telomerase components and toinvestigate a diversity of factors that regulate telomerase function in thecell.</p><p> Although much is known about protein folding and RNA folding independently, theprinciples governing recognition specificity and co-folding of protein and RNA invivo remain unclear. Therefore, we are investigating the process of RNP biogenesis.Our search for proteins involved in telomerase RNA processing and RNP assembly ledus to discover that the human telomerase complex includes a set of four proteinsshared with a family of RNPs that catalyze ribosomal RNA modification. One of theseproteins was initially identified as the gene product of the locus mutant inX-linked dyskeratosis congenita (DC). We have shown that telomerase deficiency cancompletely account for the disease phenotypes including bone marrow failure andother proliferative deficiencies. We are studying how telomerase is affected byhuman gene mutations.</p><p> RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) copy RNA templates to produce yet more RNA,contrary to the central dogma. Although viral RdRPs have clear roles in viral genomereplication, the biological significance of eukaryotic RdRP enzymes is justbeginning to be investigated. With Tetrahymena as a highly favorable model system,we are using biochemical and genetic methods to dissect how an essential eukaryoticRdRP accomplishes its specificity of template recognition and how the specificity ofdouble-stranded RNA product processing is determined. We are also interested inunderstanding how different types of RNA transcripts enter different pathways ofRNA-mediated silencing in Tetrahymena, directing the alternative outcomes of RNAdegradation or DNA elimination.</p>'

S'As an architect, I designed numerous public and private facilities includingmarket rate and affordable housing.  In the last two decades, my research hasfocused on the costs and benefits of seismic rehabilitation for existing buildings(particularly housing), post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, and lossmodeling.  A book on these issues, <i>Disaster Hits Home: New Policy for Urban Housing Recovery</i>, was published by U. C. Press in 1998.  <p>I developed a pilot study of the economic impact of disaster losses on theUniversity of California, Berkeley campus in 2000 and completed a study of thecontents losses in science laboratories with colleagues at the Pacific EarthquakeEngineering Research (PEER) Center in 2004. With William T. Holmes, I co-authored a technical manual for the seismic restraint of laboratory contents. I have completed work on downtime modeling for the PEER performance-based earthquake engineering methodology. Currently I am working on a NSF Grand Challenge -- a five year project to reduce the risk of collapse in nonductile concrete buildings.</p>'

S'<p>After about 15 years of effort, we recently completed a lengthy experimental search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron. This quantity is of interest in connection with CP violation and extensions to the standard model of particle physics. The experimental methods were those of low-energy atomic physics: atomic beams, laser spectroscopy , optical pumping, and radio-frequency magnetic resonance. We did not find a non-zero EDM, but our upper limit on it is very small, and can be used to place tight constraints on various extensions of the standard model, for example supersymmetry. </p><p>At this point, I have done the best I can on this type of research and coincident with retirement I now leave it, in the hope that younger researchers will find new methods to advance it further. After some rest and reflection, I would like to take up some new research, in the field of astrophysics. In particular, I am interested in the recent remarkable observations of distant Type 1A supernovae, and would like to study some of the many interesting physical problems associated with these observations. This means that I must become a student once again. Here, I hope that the adage: " you can\xe2\x80\x99t teach an old dog new tricks" will not render my efforts futile. </p>'

S'Degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s, Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s and muscle atrophy, in whichthe bodies capacity to regenerate new tissue can no longer keep up with tissue deathoften accompany human aging. These disorders are debilitating for individuals andrepresent a major problem for society. One intriguing possibility is that stem cellsresiding in aged organs retain their intrinsic ability to regenerate but are notproperly triggered in the aged environment and that rejuvenation of the aged nichesis actually required for the organ repair by any stem cell: endogenous ortransplanted, adult or embryonic-derived. Specifically, productive responses of agedstem cells and repair of old tissues can be rescued, when young and old mice shareblood circulation (Conboy et al., 2005). These findings, as well as their recentextrapolation in our laboratory, strongly suggest that the development of effectivestem cell based therapies for age-specific degenerative diseases critically requiresmuch improved understanding of why endogenous stem cells in older tissue are not\xe2\x80\x9cworking properly\xe2\x80\x9d even when they have the capacity to do so. The interconnectedresearch venues pursued in my lab help to understand how the process of tissuerepair is controlled, why the injured tissues are not productively repaired as weage; and to establish approaches that restore the regenerative potential both to theaged organ stem cells and to embryonic stem cells and their derivatives exposed tothe aged organ environments. Currently, we use the injury-regeneration of skeletalmuscle as our experimental system, but hope to identify fundamental mechanisms ofaging within stem cell niches, that apply to a variety of organs and tissues.'

S'<p>I joined the Berkeley Department of Anthropology in 1987. Since that time, I have continued research and publication in several interrelated areas. First, I have continued my interest in understanding the issues of gender and feminist perspectives in archaeology and in past human societies. By spring 1998, I will have co-organized two major conferences to address such issues, and published numerous articles including a 1997 review article (co-authored with Joan Gero) on the topic in the Annual Reviews of Archaeology.</p><p> Second, I have continued an interest in the interpretation and study of what is loosely called "Paleolithic art." I have continued work on the intellectual history of how this corpus of images and artifacts has been interpreted, and on bringing together various kinds of observations and research that have been ongoing in the field under different theoretical umbrellas, including practice theory and feminist theory. I have published nearly a dozen essays in this area and have recently negotiated a new book contract with the University of California Press for a book that probes the very processes of interpretation as much as the extant and historic interpretations themselves of and for this art. Because of this research interest, I have been active in the field that is called "rock art research," and have participated in numerous conferences, often internationally, specifically those concerned with the theory and social contexts of rock art research. The combined interests in prehistoric art, especially that of Paleolithic Europe, and gender and feminist archaeology, have involved recent research and publication concerning the so-called "goddess" figurines, especially of ancient Europe, in collaboration with Berkeley colleague, Ruth Tringham. We have been particularly concerned to show how the archaeological stories about these figurines have been taken up, often problematically, by contemporary popular culture.</p><p> Third, I have been carrying out a field research project since 1993, which is primarily focused on understanding the possibilities for open air archaeological evidence, especially of the late Paleolithic, in the French Midi-Pyr*n*es; this is a project we call "between the caves," since it is intended to contextualize the rich archaeological evidence of art and material culture found in the region\'s caves. That is, we believe this is a project intended to better understand the social geography and landscapes of Paleolithic art. It is also a project about fundamental archaeological survey, about survey methods, about distributional archaeology. As such, we have now carried out with support--from two grants from the National Science Foundation, one from the France-Berkeley Fund, and several from the Stahl Endowment (UC Berkeley, Archaeological Research Facility--5 years of field research, with crews of varying size and doing varied intensity of survey. This is plow-zone archaeology. To date, we have recovered more than 3000 identifiable lithic artifacts differentially distributed within a 260 square kilometer transect. The project is multi/interdisciplinary, including a geomorphological study, including a soil transport model, and interfacing with a long-term regional paleoecology/paleoenvironmental project directed by two French colleagues, who are carrying out extensive coring of regional paleolakes for palynological, sedimentological and paleoentomological evidence for past climate and environment during the pleniglacial--when Paleolithic art was being made and used.</p><p> Closely interconnected with the fieldwork, other research and publications has been an explicit research concern with pedagogy and the teaching of archaeology (including one publication to date on this topic); the development of internet resources for and the use of the internet in the teaching of Introduction to Archaeology (including the receipt of several instructional technology grants to enable this); and initiating and implementing an archaeology outreach program in local schools. I have twice been awarded teaching awards since coming to Berkeley, and have leveraged the start-up funds for a Multi-Media Teaching Laboratory for the Department of Anthropology. In July 1997, I was named the Class of 1960 Professor of Anthropology, an endowed chair.</p>'

S"<p>Evasion of host immune response recognition plays a key role in the establishment of systemic viral infection. Many viruses have evolved complex strategies for this evasion (one example being the down-regulation of cell surface MHC-I display). Such strategies are readily observable among the herpesviruses, a family of large DNA viruses that efficiently produce persistent infections and disease in their host. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; also called human herpesvirus 8) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus that is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma as well as of two AIDS-related lympho-proliferative syndromes.</p><p> We are focusing our energy on understanding the molecular mechanisms of immune evasion employed by KSHV. This will improve our understanding of KSHV pathogenesis and provide insights into basic cellular and immunological processes. Additionally, this could lead to new-antiviral strategies and the ability to exploit viral function as a tool with medical relevance.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>MHC-I downregulation by the KSHV encoded MIR proteins.</i> I have recently shown that KSHV encodes two transmembrane proteins (MIR1 and MIR2) that downregulate cell surface molecules (MHC-I, B7.2, and ICAM-1) which are involved in the immune recognition of infected cells. The pathway of this downregulation is novel: the target proteins are efficiently synthesized, matured and reach the cell surface normally. From that locale, however, they are rapidly and efficiently endocytosed and subsequently degraded in the endolysosomal compartment. I found that expression of MIR1 and MIR2 leads to ubiquitination of the cytosolic tail of their target proteins and that this ubiquitination is essential for their removal from the cell surface. MIR proteins thus define a novel class of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligases that modulate the trafficking of host cell membrane proteins. </p><p>We are now pursuing the characterization of the molecular mechanism of MIR-mediated downregulation. Our recent experiments have suggested that host proteins are involved in this process. We are currently pursuing the identification of these MIR-interacting host components. These results should shed light on the molecular details of the connection between ubiquitination and endocytosis, and further inform our understanding of this unusual pathway of immune evasion.</p><p> Interestingly, structural homologues of the MIRs can be found in most eukaryotic organisms although no function has yet been attributed to their expression. Thus, dissection of the mechanism of MIR-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis may lead to the discovery of novel cellular mechanisms involved in protein trafficking. </p><p><i>Identification of additional KSHV proteins implicated in immune evasion.</i> Herpesviruses generally employ several different strategies to achieve immune evasion, including the sabotage of MHC antigen processing pathways, the molecular mimicry of host signaling molecules and the expression of decoys that inhibit natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated killing. It is thus unlikely that the MIR proteins alone are sufficient to allow for a complete immune evasion by the virus. This idea is supported by our observation that MIR expressing cells have an increased sensitivity to natural killer cell lysis. Using various approaches, we will identify additional KSHV proteins implicated in other forms of immune evasion (NK cell avoidance, resistance to complement lysis, etc.).</p>"

S'<p>Cindy Cox\xe2\x80\x99s music is noted for its special harmonies and textural colorations, such as the recently premiered Eco Ensemble piece "Transfigurations of Grief" and the piano trio "la mar amarga". Many of her works play on themes of nature and natural landscapes, from her early orchestral "Cathedral Spires" (performed by Leonard Slatkin and the National Symphony) to her very recent "Ca\xc3\xb1on" (premiered by the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra). Her pieces also frequently make use of technology and interactive electronics, as in "The Shape of the Shell" for bass clarinettist Laura Carmichael, and "Nature is" for the Continental Trombone Quartet, both created at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Cox is also very active as a pianist, with many of her compositions for solo piano. She has performed and recorded her "Sylvan pieces", her "Hierosgamos: Seven Studies in Harmony and Resonance", and "The Blackbird whistling/Or just after". The newer texted works, such as "Singing the lines" (recently premiered by Lucy Shelton and the Berkeley Contemporary Chamber Players), "The Other Side of the World" (recorded by both Laurel Zucker and Nina Assimakopolous), and "Hysteria" (premiered and recorded by Abbie Conant) evolved through collaboration with her husband, poet John Campion. She has received awards and commissions from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Fromm Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Composers Forum, ASCAP, Meet the Composer, and the Gemeinschaft der Kunstlerinnen und Kunstfreunde International Competition for Women Composers. She has been a Fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center, the Aspen Music Festival, the MacDowell Colony, and the Civitella Ranieri and William Walton Foundations in Italy.</p><p>Recent performances have taken place at the Festival di Musica Contemporanea at the American Academy in Rome ("Four Studies of Light and Dark"), the Festival Architecture et Musique in Angers, France ("The Other Side of the World"), the Kosmos Frauenraum in Vienna ("Hysteria", filmed for Austrian National Television), M\xc3\xbcnster Gesellschaft f\xc3\xbcr Neue Musik, the Bibliotecha National in Buenos Aires ("Hierosgamos" and "Transfigurations of Grief"), the Galapagos Art Space in Brooklyn ("Hierosgamos"), the REDCAT/Cal Arts Theater in Los Angeles ("Hysteria"), Carnegie and Merkin Halls in New York City ("Hierosgamos and The Blackbird whistling/Or just after"), the National Gallery in Washington ("Hierosgamos"), the Library of Congress ("Into the Wild"), the Kennedy Center ("Cathedral Spires"), the Los Angeles Philharmonic Green Umbrella series ("Primary Colors"), and by notable ensembles such as the Kronos Quartet, the American Composers Orchestra, the National Symphony, the California Symphony, the Alexander Quartet, the Paul Dresher Ensemble, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, the Women\'s Philharmonic, Composers\' Inc, the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra, and the Earplay Ensemble. A new full length recording, la mar amarga: music of Cindy Cox on the Albany Records label features the piano trio "la mar amarga", the duo for amplified harpsichord and prepared piano "Playing a round", and the large piano cycle "Sylvan pieces" (performed by the composer). She has two other complete CDs of her solo and chamber music, Columba aspexit on New World (formerly CRI) and Nature is on Albany Records. She is also recorded on the Capstone, Arpa Viva, Inflorescence, Mark, and Valve-Heartz of Cologne labels. Her scores are published through World a Tuning Fork Press (<a href="http://www.cacox.com" title="www.cacox.com">www.cacox.com</a>).</p><p>Cox earned her doctorate in 1992 from Indiana University, studying composition with Harvey Sollberger, Donald Erb, Eugene O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, and John Eaton. She had additional studies with John Harbison at the Tanglewood Music Center, and Bernard Rands and Jacob Druckman at the Aspen Music Festival. As a pianist she studied with the famed Mozart and Schubert specialist Lili Kraus. Cindy Cox is presently a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and holds the Jerry and Evelyn Chambers Chair in music.</p>'

S'<p>My main research interest is in exploring the local electronic properties of atomic-scale structures at surfaces. I am also interested in studying how local interactions between atomic-scale structures affect the morphology and dynamics of mesoscopic systems. My main experimental tool is the ultra-high vacuum cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope, which can be used to both fabricate atomic-scale structures and probe them spectroscopically.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Atomic manipulation: The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to position individual atoms and molecules on a conducting surface, allowing the fabrication of precise atomic-scale structures. We have built a low temperature STM that is capable of performing atomic manipulation, and we are currently exploring the physical parameters necessary to controllably position atoms and molecules on different substrates. The ability to manipulate an atom depends on the relative strength of its coupling to the surface and to the STM tip. By characterizing these interactions we extend our ability to fabricate structures at the atomic-scale, and further our understanding of how adsorbates bind to surfaces.</p><p>Visualizing low dimensional electronic behavior: Electrons at some metal surfaces occupy a 2-dimensional surface state, known as a Shockley state. These electrons can be observed with an STM, allowing direct visualization of the quantum mechanical state density of 2-dimensional electronic wavefunctions. We are currently studying such systems in an effort to better understand how 2-d electrons interact with adsorbates, artificially fabricated atomic-scale structures, and surface reconstructions.</p><p>Magnetic nanostructures: One of the smallest magnetic structures imaginable is a single magnetic atom in a non-magnetic host. If the host is a metal, then spin-flip scattering between conduction electrons and the magnetic impurity leads to a many-body groundstate where an extended cloud of electrons screens the local impurity moment. This is known as the Kondo effect, and the influence of the "Kondo screening cloud" on macroscopic material properties has been well studied. We are currently using a low temperature STM to directly investigate the local electronic properties of individual Kondo impurities at a clean metal surface. We are using the atomic manipulation capabilities of our STM to probe magnetic interaction effects between individual Kondo impurities and also to study artificially fabricated clusters of magnetic atoms. These studies help us to understand how the properties of microscopic magnetic structures evolve with the overall size of a system.</p><p>Nanostructures on semiconductors: Microfabricated circuit elements on semiconducting substrates form the core of current high technology. We are using a low temperature STM to probe the limits of atomic manipulation on semiconducting surfaces. Single atom manipulation on semiconductors holds the possibility of providing us with the ability to fabricate 1-dimensional wires only a single atom wide. These structures are predicted to exhibit novel electronic behavior, such as the Luttinger liquid groundstate. Such studies bring us closer to the goal of exploring electrical circuitry at the ultimate level of miniaturization.</p><p>Carbon nanostructures: sp2 bonded carbon lattices have been shown to yield a fabulous diversity of molecular structures with striking electronic and structural properties. One exciting aspect of these "fullerines" is that their properties can be tuned through doping and structural modification, opening possibilities for new device applications. We are interested in characterizing the electronic properties of "bare" fullerine molecules, as well as atomically-fabricated and molecularly functionalized fullerine structures. Current projects involve C60 and carbon nanotubes deposited onto metal and semiconducting surfaces.</p>'

S'<p>Our group is currently involved in a research program using muons to improve the accuracy of the coupling strengths of two basic weak interactions. The first experiment, MuLAN, is designed to improve the precision of the muon lifetime by a factor of ten which according to the most recent theoretical studies will enable a clean extraction of the Fermi electro-weak coupling constant, GF to ~1 ppm. The second experiment, MuCAP, is a precision measurement of the simplest muon capture process, that of the muon on the proton from the singlet 1s state of the muonic hydrogen atom. This measurement has not been improved in nearly 30 years because of systematic errors due to other capture reactions which were poorly understood. These complications are all addressed by the novel techniques of the new experiment based on a pure hydrogen TPC. We expect to improve the accuracy by a factor 4-5 of the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant, gP. The experimental group is part of an international collaboration working at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.</p>'

S'<p>The global physical environment is a vast and complex machine composed of  numerous interconnected systems capable of dramatic change over brief intervals of  time. A solid understanding of the character and dynamics of this machine can  explain a diversity of engaging geographical phenomena, from the aesthetically  stunning views on a high Sierra Nevada mountain summit to the devastating loss of  life and property resulting from land-slides and floods.</p><p>The purpose of Professor  Cuffey\'s scholarship is to design, improve, evaluate, and enjoy such explanations.  Two complementary approaches in this pursuit are:</p><ol><li>To achieve a rigorous  physically-based understanding of environmental processes and system dynamics.</li><li>To reconstruct the remarkable "natural experiments" of Earth\'s environmental  history.</li></ol><p>Professor Cuffey&nbsp;uses both approaches.    Constraints on time, technology, and brainpower have forced Professor Cuffey, like  most scholars, to the bittersweet reality of specialization; his research efforts  emphasize environmental change of polar regions, with a focus on glaciologic  problems. The choice of polar glaciology reflects the unique and powerful  contributions that this subdiscipline makes to environmental change research. Ice  core reconstructions of environmental history offer the most comprehensive, varied,  and high-resolution view yet achieved of past environments. The ice sheets  themselves are a major control on global sea level and albedo, and on high-latitude  atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and on physical landscape characteristics. No  other topographic features of this size and importance are changeable on such short  time scales.</p><p>Professor Cuffey uses a quantitatively rigorous blend of geophysical and geochemical  techniques to address questions that are important in this context:</p><ul><li>How have  climatic temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations covaried in the  past?</li><li>What is the tempo and magnitude of climate changes in polar regions?</li><li>What  determines the isotopic composition of precipitation?</li><li>How have the great ice sheets  changed in the past, and how will they change in the future? How do they flow?</li><li>How  are microphysical processes in ice manifest at the scale of whole glaciers and ice  sheets?</li></ul><p>In addition to these major research themes, he also works on biogeography and  temperate geomorphology.</p>'

These aims are achieved through several different experimental approaches and methodologies. First, we employ a neuroimaging method called functional MRI (fMRI) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates and temporal dynamics of various cognitive processes in normal human subjects. A key focus has been the cognitive functions supported by prefrontal cortex. Second, we have been investigating the role of the dopaminergic system in working memory and frontal lobe function. This aim is achieved with pharmacological studies during which direct dopaminergic agonists are administered to normal human subjects, as well as patients with frontal lobe lesions, to determine the effect of dopamine on cognition. Third, we perform behavioral studies in patient populations with frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g. stroke, head injury, Parkinson's disease) in order to further understand the mechanisms that underlie working memory.</p>"

Concurrently, we build models linking activity-dependent synaptic plasticity to experience-induced modification of cortical receptive fields and changes in visual perception. Predictions of these models are then tested in electrophysiological experiments in vivo and psychophysical experiments on human subjects. In addition, we use the two-photon imaging technique to study the effect of electrical activity on structure and function of visual cortical neurons. The combination of these techniques allow us to elucidate the function of various cellular components in information processing and help to bridge our understanding of neuronal functions at the cellular and systems levels.</p>'

S'<p>My research is focused on physical cosmology, especially on questions of the nature of large scale structure in the Universe and its evolution. My students and I have undertaken large redshift surveys of galaxies, with the goal of measuring statistical properties of the galaxy distribution that are useful for the determination of cosmological parameters. With students and postdocs, I have worked on large scale simulation studies of structure formation as tests of alternative cosmologies and various models of dark matter. Recent work has focused on detailed comparisons of the measured velocity field of galaxies with the gravity field inferred from the large scale galaxy distribution. We have simulated the formation of galaxies with inclusion of gas dynamical effects and feedback from star formation. Future work will involve extensive use of the 10 meter Keck telescope.</p><p><b>Current projects</b></p><p>For the past several years, we have been planning a new spectroscopic survey of the distant Universe, the DEIMOS/DEEP redshift survey. This will be a unique enterprise combining the power of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest telescope with a new wide-field, medium resolution optical spectrograph, DEIMOS, which has been optimized for this project. Beginning in the Spring of 2002, we shall use this instrument in a program of 120 Keck nights over a three-year period, with the goal of obtaining high quality spectra of 60,000 galaxies at redshift Z~1. The intent is to use Keck as a time machine to study galaxies and their clustering properties as they were at half the present age of the Universe. Such studies are sensitive probes of cosmological models and will yield unprecedented information on the formation history of galaxies.</p><p>Our understanding of cosmology has made rapid progress, but fundamental unsolved mysteries remain. Recent evidence suggests that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, which, according to Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of General Relativity, can occur only if the Universe contains a substantial amount of \xe2\x80\x9cdark energy\xe2\x80\x9d with negative pressure, in addition to the ubiquitous \xe2\x80\x9cdark matter\xe2\x80\x9d needed to explain structure in the Universe and the masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. There are no laboratory experiments that can probe the \xe2\x80\x9cdark energy\xe2\x80\x9d sector; only by global cosmological investigations can this mysterious component be constrained. Yet such a component of the Universe must ultimately be explained by fundamental physics, and it is therefore important that independent investigations with different sytematic errors be brought to bear on this question. By counting the abundance of galaxies as a function of their internal linewidth, or by counting clusters of galaxies as a function of their internal velocity dispersion, the DEIMOS/DEEP survey will set stringent constraints on the properties of the dark energy. Further details are provided on the web pages above.</p><p>There is opportunity in my research group for new students to join in this major research program. Our team is small and there is ample opportunity for enterprising students to take charge of major components of the survey.</p>'

S'<p>Research in my laboratory focuses on the interface between plants and their environment. The tools of physiological and evolutionary plant ecology are currently being applied towards the study and interpretation of this interface. Investigations draw upon a variety of physiological methods, modeling and the use of stable isotopes as avenues for improving our understanding of how the ecophysiological characteristics of plants are shaped by and respond to the environments they inhabit. Projects done in my laboratory pay special attention to how aspects of plant form and function combine to permit adaptation to environmental variation, whether naturally or anthropogenically imposed, and how plants and their unique traits influence the structure and function of the communities and ecosystems they compose. </p><p>Current research themes include (1) measuring how the ecological and physiological characteristics of plants influence community and ecosystem processes. Here, work on the water, carbon and nutrient relations of plants and how they influence ecosystem hydrology and biogeochemistry are of particular interest; (2) elucidating how particular functional adaptations of plants are either constrained by or the result of their unique evolutionary history. Here we are examining the adaptations that confer tolerance to low soil nutrient status, periodic drought, or low light and disturbance in plant species or groups where we know about something about their evolutionary history; and (3) looking at the fluxes and exchanges of materials such as carbon, water and nitrogen between organisms and their biotic and abitoic environments. Here the application of novel stable isotope techniques is proving to be especially powerful in looking at the origin of CO2 from different ecosystems and the exchange of water and nitrogen between plants and their fungal (mycorrhizal) symbionts or their neighbors. </p>'

S'<p>My research combines human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. My work extends from laboratory-based cellular-molecular neurobiology to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language. Many of these interests are explored in my 1997 book, <i>The Symbolic Species: The Coevolution ofLanguage and the Brain</i>.</p><p> My neurobiological research is focused on determining the nature of the human divergence from typical primate brain anatomy, the cellular-molecular mechanisms producing this difference, and the correlations between these anatomical differences and special human cognitive abilities, particularly language. In pursuit of these questions I have used a variety of laboratory approaches including the tracing ofaxonal connections, quantitative analysis of regions of different species brains,and cross-species fetal neural transplantation. Future lab research plans will focus on the developmental mechanisms that distinguish human brains from other primate brains. Future theoretical research will focus on the role played by self-organizational dynamics in the evolution of complex adaptations, like language.</p><p> My theoretical interests include the study of evolution-like processes at manylevels, including their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing,language change, and social processes, and focusing especially on how thesedifferent processes interact and depend on each other. In addition, I have along-standing interest in developing a scientific semiotics that could contribute to both linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience. This is fueled by a career-long interest in the ideas of the late 19th-century American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce. I am just completing a new book, <i>Homunculus</i>, which explores therelationship between evolutionary and semiotic processes.</p>'

The first one has to do with the long process of the drainage of the lakes of Mexico City\xe2\x80\x99s starting in 1607 and finished during the Porfiriato or\xe2\x80&#148;depending on the sources and the perspective\xe2\x80&#148;unfinished until now. I am interested in analyzing the relationships among technology, religion, culture, and government articulated by the Mexicas, the Spanish empire, and the Mexican nation as seen in their handling of the climatic and hydrographic situation of Mexico City\xe2\x80\x99s location. In the second project, I\xe2\x80\x99m studying the role of the colonization of America from the 15th century onward in the development of new epistemologies and political theories. I want to explore the ways in which first, the unprecedented violence of conquest and colonization, and secondly, the need for a correct administration of the colonies, brought about important theoretical, technological, and epistemological changes which may have been conceived to be practiced in the colonies, but which in the long run transformed the way Europe understood and fashioned itself.</p>'

S'<p>For genetic information to be transmitted from parent to progeny through sexual reproduction, chromosomes must undergo a special division process called meiosis. Errors in this process lead to aneuploidy and are a major cause of human birth defects such as Down syndrome. We are investigating how chromosomes are reorganized during this unique cell cycle by combining high-resolution imaging of chromosomes in situ and in vivo with the molecular genetic advantages of C. elegans. A fundamental goal of our work is to understand how specific DNA sequences confer not only gene expression patterns but also the large-scale 3dimensional organization of the genome.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Dissecting the function of meiotic Pairing Centers.</i> When most people think of genomics, they often consider only the portion of the genome containing protein coding and expression information. My group is interested how information encoded within the genome controls global chromosome architecture and mediates interactions between chromosomes and other components of the cellular machinery. In all eukaryotes, simple, repetitive sequence elements play major roles in chromosome structure and inheritance functions. For example, work in a variety of organisms has elucidated the behavior of centromeres and telomeres, two types of sites containing noncoding sequences with fundamental roles in chromosome organization and function. We are exploring the function of another type of cisacting site that is much more poorly understood: meiotic Pairing Centers. In C. elegans, these specific sites on each of the six chromosomes are essential for meiotic recombination and accurate segregation. </p><p>New tools for understanding noncoding DNA sequences have become available through genome sequencing efforts. C. elegans is unusual in that its genome assemblies now include virtually all of the so-called "junk DNA" - the simplesequence repetitive elements, or heterochromatin. Through bioinformatics, we have identified a unique repetitive element whose genomic distribution corresponds precisely with the location of meiotic Pairing Centers, and we are currently testing whether this sequence can mediate homologous interactions during meiosis. Using classical and reverse genetics, we have also identified a number of genes that interact with the Pairing Centers, and we are working to understand how their encoded proteins contribute to the function of these sites.</p><p><i> Meiotic chromosome dynamics in vivo.</i> A major goal of our lab is to understand how the biophysical properties of chromosomes are modulated during meiosis, and how these properties control behaviors such as homolog pairing and recombination. Because C. elegans is optically transparent, we can observe these dynamic events as they occur in living animals. We have recorded large-scale chromosome movements during the stages of homolog pairing and synapsis using high-resolution 4-dimensional imaging. We are identifying the molecules driving this movement, and developing methods to describe these dynamics quantitatively. A key goal for the future is to implement automated methods to extract information from complex 4-D images.</p>'

His approach uses field work, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling to quantify and explore geomorphic processes. One result of these combined approaches has been the development of "geomorphic transport laws" that can be field-calibrated and used in both landscape evolution modeling and in practical applications. He has used high resolution laser altimetry to create detailed topographic maps and cosmogenic nuclide analysis to obtain estimates of rates of processes and to quantify transport laws. Numerical modeling work is underway to exploit both the high resolution topography and rate measurements to explore controls on landscape morphology.</p>'

S"Waverly Ding's research interests are primarily in the areas of academic entrepreneurship, academic-industry interaction, technology strategy and innovation. She studies conditions under which university-employed scientists start or advise biotechnology firms. She also investigates the gender gap in scientists\xe2\x80\x99 participation in commercial activities (e.g., patenting and transitioning to the entrepreneurial role). In addition, she examines the impact of patenting activity on academic scientists\xe2\x80\x99 research output. She finds that after a scientist starts to patent, there is an increase in the scientist\xe2\x80\x99s research productivity (measured by number of research publications), though there is also evidence that his or her direction of research becomes more applied and commercial-oriented. A related area of Prof. Ding's research focuses on technology strategy of biotechnology firms. She asks why for-profit biotech firms adopt the \xe2\x80\x9copen science\xe2\x80\x9d strategy, i.e., allow their research employees to engage in basic science research and publish research findings in scientific journals. She finds biotech firms\xe2\x80\x99 decision to adopt this strategy is jointly shaped by the organizational blueprints laid out by their founders, the appropriability of their technology, and peer pressure. Prof. Ding also studies how biotech firms exploit their brokerage role between academia and more established life sciences firms. These biotech firms survive and grow by licensing in promising scientific discoveries from universities and then out-licensing these technologies further to downstream, more established life sciences partners."

S'<p>RNA forms a variety of complex globular structures, some of which function like enzymes or form functional complexes with proteins. There are two major areas of focus in the lab: viral control of human protein synthesis, and RNA-mediated gene regulation. We are interested in understanding and comparing molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis used in human cells and by viruses that infect those cells. In particular, we are investigating RNA-mediated initiation of protein synthesis, focusing on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA from Hepatitis C virus. Cryo-EM, x-ray crystallography and biochemical experiments are focused on understanding the structure and mechanism of the IRES and its amazing ability to hijack the human ribosome and associated translation factors. A second area of focus in the lab is the molecular basis for RNA-mediated genetic control, in which small RNAs are generated and used to target specific gene transcripts for destruction. Our lab investigates the pathways of small RNA-mediated gene regulation in both human cells and in bacteria. Each of these projects seeks to understand the molecular basis for RNA function, using a combination of structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches.</p>'

My specialty is the social and cultural history of the Eastern Mediterranean during the late Ottoman period (18th and 19th centuries). I try to paint a live portrait of everyday life through studying family history, the political economy of urban-rural relations, and connections between gender and property.

S'<p>Our research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular morphogenesis and plasma membrane dynamics in mammalian cells and in budding yeast. We are studying the functions and structure-function relationships of cytoskeletal proteins involved in morphogenesis and in membrane trafficking, and are elucidating the regulatory circuitry that controls the activity of these cytoskeletal proteins. The approaches employed for these studies include genome-wide functional analyses, genetics and molecular genetics, biochemistry, and real time image analysis of live cells.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Cell Polarity Development and Endocytosis in Budding Yeast.</i> A large number of genes that control cellular morphogenesis and membrane trafficking in budding yeast have been identified. The challenge now is to determine how the products of these genes cooperate to control cell polarity development and trafficking events. The membrane actin cytoskeleton undergoes a carefully coordinated sequence of changes in organization during the cell cycle. These changes ultimately direct yeast morphological development and facilitate membrane trafficking events integral to morphogenesis. To understand how the organization of the cytoskeleton changes in response to a variety of signals, we have biochemically and genetically identified many yeast proteins that bind to actin filaments and regulate their assembly and/or organization. We have genetically tested the roles of these proteins in the living cell and have begun to study their spatial and temporal regulation by real-time fluorescence microscopy. </p><p><i>Membrane Trafficking Events in Mammalian Cells.</i> Since actin is among the most highly conserved proteins known, we have long believed that the results we obtain from studies on the yeast actin cytoskeleton will be directly transferable to more complex eukaryotes including humans. Defects in trafficking events and cytoskeletal proteins are linked to human diseases such as cancer and neural degeneration. Recently, we have begun to isolate and characterize mammalian homologues of cytoskeletal proteins that we first identified and characterized in yeast. We are particularly interested in determining the roles of these proteins in endocytosis and Golgi trafficking. One protein, huntingtin interacting protein 1R (Hip1R), which binds to the Huntingtin disease protein, plays a critical role in productively harnessing forces of actin polymerization for steps in membrane trafficking. We are also interested in investigating the roles of this and other cytoskeletal proteins in tumor cell invasion. </p><p><i>Actin Assembly.</i> Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms used to regulate actin assembly will require a detailed knowledge of how actin subunits assemble into long polymers, and how proteins that bind to monomers and polymers affect assembly dynamics. We have performed a structure-function analysis of actin by mutating residues involved in nucleotide hydrolysis and assaying the effects of these mutations on actin assembly in vitro and in vivo. In complementary studies, genetic, biochemical and structural studies of the low molecular weight (16 kD) actin filament severing protein cofilin and its cofactor, Aip1p, and the actin nucleotide exchange factor, profilin, are being performed to determine how filament turnover is controlled in vivo. We have also identified and are studying several novel activators of the Arp2/3 complex, which regulates actin nucleation, and we are also studying the role of nucleotide in Arp2/3 function. By combining genetics with biochemistry, we are able to achieve a deeper understanding of actin regulation than would have been possible using either approach alone.</p>'

S'<p><i>Research in Carcinogenesis:</i> Aneuploidy, an abnormal balance of chromosomes is (i) ubiquitous in cancer, is (ii) proportional to the degree of malignancy of cancer, and (iii) inevitably generates abnormal phenotypes, because it alters the dosages and expression of thousands of normal genes. Take Down syndrome, a trisomy of chromosome 21, as an example. In view of this we have recently proposed that aneuploidy is sufficient to cause cancer. Our hypothesis proposes that cancer-specific chromosome combinations, or aneusomies, cause cancer-specific phenotypes. According to this hypothesis carcinogens initiate carcinogenesis with a random aneuploidy. Aneuploidy then renders chromosome segregation and maintenance error-prone because it unbalances teams of spindle proteins, repair enzymes, and even centrosome numbers. The resulting chain reaction of chromosome reassortments then generates cancer-specific aneuploidy and further random aneuploidy autocatalytically.</p><p>The aneuploidy-cancer hypothesis predicts all peculiar aspects of carcinogenesis, particularly those that have remained paradoxical according to the competing gene-mutation hypothesis: For example, 1) The ubiquity of aneuploidy in cancer. In contrast, the mutation hypothesis predicts diploid cancers. 2) Carcinogens function as aneuploidogens. This was confirmed with non-mutagenic and mutagenic carcinogens. For example, 100% of Chinese hamster cells transformed in vitro by the non-mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were aneuploid. But non-mutagenic carcinogens are a paradox of the mutation hypothesis. 3) Aneuploidy prior to carcinogenesis. This has been confirmed by us and others. 4) The slow kinetics of carcinogenesis, from experimental or accidental carcinogen to cancer. This is explained by the low probability of evolving cancer-specific aneuploidies by random chromosome assortments _ a process analogous to phylogenesis. By contrast, the mutation hypothesis predicts carcinogenesis without lag, because mutation is instantaneous. 5) The genetic instability and the corresponding heterogeneous phenotypes of cancer. These are based on the inherent instability of the aneuploid karyotype. But, stable phenotypes are predicted by the mutation hypothesis because gene mutations are stable. 6) The ability of cancer cells to become resistant against a selected, chemotherapeutic drug, and simultaneously against many unselected drugs. This is also explained by aneuploidy-catalyzed reassortments of chromosomes, encoding selected and un-selected resistances in the same chromosomes. This hypothesis also explains the failure of diploid cells of cancer patients to become drug-resistant. 7) The low risk of transformation of human cells by carcinogens, compared to rodent cells, is thought to reflect the high resistance of human cells to aneuploidization. This is currently tested experimentally. </p><p>The aneuploidy-cancer hypothesis predicts improvements in cancer prevention by eliminating aneuploidogens from food and drugs, and in therapy by early detection of preneoplastic cells, eg. Pap smears, based on the presence of aneuploidy. </p><p><i>Research in Virology:</i> A thorough audit of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the various AIDS epidemics of the US, Europe and Africa have chemical bases, namely toxic, recreational drugs, DNA-chain terminators prescribed as anti-HIV drugs and malnutrition. </p>'

S'<p>Research follows two general themes. In the first, we are studying the properties of conductors and superconductors which are highly disordered and have reduced dimensionality. We deposit ultra thin films (as thin as one atomic layer) on cold substrates and study their conduction properties. Depending on various properties (thickness, temperature, material) these films can be metallic, insulating or superconducting. Furthermore, using electron beam lithography techniques developed in our laboratory, we can make these films as narrow as \xe2\x80\xb0 100\xc3\x85 (only 30 atoms across). This allows studies in both 2 dimensions and one dimension and puts us, at low temperatures, into the quantum mechanical regime. We are extending our work to include ferromagnetic materials.</p><p>The second area of study is on high Tc superconductors. Transport, Hall effect and electron tunneling measurements are employed to shed light on the mechanism responsible for superconductivity in these materials. In addition, we are investigating various device ideas employing these novel materials and the physics knowledge we obtain.</p><p>These studies incorporate graduate students in physics and materials science as well as undergraduates.</p>'

S'<p>Our lab is interested in how genome sequences specify organismal form and function. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the complex, coordinated patterns of gene expression that underlie animal development and the responses of microbes to changes in their environment are orchestrated by information in genome sequences. We address these questions using both experimental and computational genomic techniques.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Cracking the cis-regulatory code:</i> Genome sequences are more than just a collection of coding regions strung together by junk DNA - they also contain information specifying when and where genes should be made. This regulatory information is critical to the proper functioning of virtually all biological processes. We are interested in precisely how this information is encoded in genome sequences. Our research involves the analysis of two systems: early embryonic development of the fruitflies and environmental stress responses in yeasts. We use diverse types of experimental data (some generated in our lab), including gene expression data, genome sequences, and characterizations of in vitro and in vivo transcription factor binding specificities to develop and apply computational tools to analyze cis-regulatory sequences and the transcriptional regulatory networks that read them out. </p><p>In the next few years, much of our work will focus on comparative genome sequence analysis. The genome sequence of a second Drosophila species will be completed in mid-2002, and species of 6 additional Saccharomycete yeasts have already been sequenced. We believe that this data will reveal critical aspects of the organization of cis-regulatory regions and how their architecture is related to their function.</p><p><i> Genomic approaches to studying ecology and evolution:</i> In addition to studying how regulatory information is encoded in genome sequences, we are very interested in understanding the role that gene expression plays phenotypic variation within populations and in evolution. We are starting to use detailed experimental-genomics (i.e. microarray) techniques to study the natural ecology of fungi and the evolution of complex phenotypes related to their natural ecology, such as nutrient utilization and stress response. Our goals are to characterize natural gene expression variation is wild fungal populations, to identify aspects of gene expression patterns that are correlated with complex organismal phenotypes, and to link these to changes in the genome, using a variety of techniques to rapidly map the genetic basis of complex phenotypes. </p><p><i>Classification of tumors:</i> In collaboration with physicians at Stanford, we are using human DNA microarrays to conduct genome-scale characterizations of gene expression in human tumors, with the goal of developing improved and higher resolution methods for classifying tumors. A fundamental difficulty in the understanding, prevention and treatment of cancer is that the currently recognized disease classes (e.g. breast cancer) are each really a collection of diseases having significant features in common (e.g. the organ where the tumor arose) but also many features that distinguish them. The diversity within most disease categories is reflected in a diversity of clinical outcomes and responses to specific therapeutic regimes. We have begun to use genome-wide gene expression measurements to build a higher resolution and more clinically relevant taxonomy of human tumors. In an analysis of tumors from patients with a type of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, we were able to identify two molecularly distinct subgroups of tumors that differed significantly in their response to standard chemotherapy regimes. We are expanding these studies to include more patients and more types of tumors, with the ultimate hope of being able to classify all human tumors in clinically homogenous groups.</p><p><i> Databases and Microarray Analysis Software:</i> In support of our experimental projects, and to assist other researchers applying genomic tools or using their information, we develop, support and apply database and analysis software that helps transform the massive amounts of data generated by genome-scale experiments into meaningful biological insights. We are particularly interested in methods and software that help researchers identify and visualize coherent features in genomic data. </p>'

S'<p>Although most of the universe is in the plasma state, the basic properties of plasmas are not well understood. Plasmas are collective systems, and exhibit remarkably complicated nonlinear behaviors like turbulence and chaos. Better understanding of basic plasma physics should help us in areas as diverse as astrophysics and plasma processing. </p><p>My group studies an unusual type of plasma\xe2\x80&#148;non-neutral plasmas. Such plasmas consist of particles of only one sign of charge: typically electrons, ions, positrons, or antiprotons. Since non-neutral plasmas are extraordinarily stable, readily controllable, and easily diagnosed, they are ideal for many basic plasma physics experiments. In addition, non-neutral plasmas can be used for experiments on fluid dynamics nonlinear dynamics and antihydrogen formation. As non-neutral plasmas are confined in small scale traps, experiments are run by one or two people.</p><p><b>Current projects</b></p><p>Currently our research is focused on three problems:</p><p>Antihydrogen formation:  One of the most exciting recent physics accomplishments was the production of antihydrogen at CERN.  The antihydrogen was synthesized from positron and antiproton plasmas quite similar to the electron plasmas that we make in our lab.  Ultimately, researchers intend to look for CPT violations by comparing the spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen, and, possibly, anomalous gravitational effects on antimatter.  However the researchers at CERN were only able to create antihydrogen, not trap it, and the most interesting physics can only be done on trapped antihydrogen.  We have joined a new group, ALPHA <a href="http://alpha.web.cern.ch/alpha/" title="http://alpha.web.cern.ch/alpha/">http://alpha.web.cern.ch/alpha/</a> whose goal is to trap antihydrogen, and are currently running tests at Berkeley on trapping schemes. </p><p>BGK waves: Recently we discovered a method of generating very large, very high Q structures in our plasmas.  These structures are related to BGK waves.  BGK wave theory underpins much of theory of nonlinear waves in plasmas, but have rarely been observed, and never with such high Q or high amplitude. They are related to the structures seen in space plasmas and in laser-plasma interactions. We have been studying the details of these waves, particularly their harmonic content, lifetime, and excitation method. </p><p>Autoresonance: Autoresonance is a powerful, very general technique for exciting nonlinear oscillators. We study this technique in experiments using our plasmas, analytic theory, and numerical simulations. </p>'

Dr. Fernald was a Fulbright Scholar in Jamaica and has been working in the field of public health nutrition for over fifteen years focusing specifically on children in developing countries.  Her research focuses primarily on how inequalities in socio-economic position contribute to growth and developmental outcomes in children, and secondarily, on how interventions can address socio-economic and health disparities.  The majority of her research has been focused on the examination of large samples of low-income populations in rural and urban Mexico, Ecuador, South Africa and Madagascar.  Much of her work for the past decade has centered on looking at the effects conditional cash transfer programs, microcredit interventions, and community based nutrition interventions and their effects on child development.</p>'

Her professional specializations are second language learning and teaching, the education of language minority students, and the socialization of children for learning across cultures. Over the past thirty years, she has conducted studies of second language learners in school settings. Her most recent study is of the language resources of Alaskan Native children in several Yup\xe2\x80\x99ik villages along the Yukon River. She is currently engaged in studies of the academic language demands of high stakes tests such as California\xe2\x80\x99s High School Exit Examination and the SAT-9, and considerations of what kind of instructional support is needed by English language learners and speakers of English dialects (e.g., African-American English, Alaskan Village English, Chicano English, etc.) to deal successfully with such tests and other uses of academic language. Another area of work that has engaged Fillmore in the past decade is the revitalization of indigenous languages in the Southwest. She has been working with leadersin several pueblos in New Mexico in support of language programs for the teaching of heritage languages to the children in those communities.</p>'

S'<p>My research investigates the origin and maintenance of Amazonian rain forest tree diversity. I am especially interested in the role that biotic interactions and environmental heterogeneity play in the morphological, functional, and genetic diversity of tropical trees, and how these factors influence the distribution and speciation of plants. An ideal study system is the endemic flora found on the many white-sand forests that are widely dispersed in patches throughout the Amazon basin.  These ancient white-sand deposits constitute habitat islands, surrounded by other terra firme forests on more fertile soils, and they harbor edaphic-specialist tree species that are often closely related (if not sister taxa) to congeners on neighboring soil types. The main thrust of my research is to understand the evolution and maintenance of edaphic specialization by trees to these divergent soil types, and the role of herbivores in this process.</p><p>Current projects include 1) an evaluation of the role of soil type and geographic distance in structuring the lineages of geographically sympatric sister species complexes in the genus Protium (Burseraceae) that are associated with divergent soil types across the Amazon basin 2) an investigation of the role of trait evolution (including antiherbivore defenses), phylogenetic relatedness, and habitat specialization in the assembly of Amazonian plant communities and 3) testing the relative importance of  time, area, colonization history, and the evolution of morphological innovation in the diversification of the sister families Anacardiaceae and Burseraceae.</p><p>To ask these questions, we work in the field and in the laboratory.  We conduct floristic inventories, reciprocal transplant experiments, physiological measurements (including plant defense chemistry), and collect molecular data at both the population and species-level.</p>'

S"<p>Our overall goal is to characterize the cell signaling pathways that inhibit the uncontrolled growth of epithelial-derived tumor cells, the cell type of most human cancers. Molecular, genetic and cell biological experimental strategies are being utilized to explore the mechanisms by which extracellular signals (such as steroid hormones, growth factors and certain dietary compounds) coordinately regulate the proliferation and cell-cell interactions of reproductive tumor cells.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p>Glucocorticoids have potent anti-proliferative effects on steroid-responsive mammary tumor cells by regulating the expression and activity of cell signaling molecules. We isolated a novel serum and glucocorticoid-inducible Ser/Thr protein kinase, Sgk, that is unique in its transcriptional control by several distinct signal transduction pathways, including glucocorticoids, serum, growth factors, environmental stress, and the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The tissue distribution and developmental profile of Sgk is consistent with a physiological role for Sgk in cellular stress responses. We are investigating the osmotic shock and radiation-induced signaling pathways that target the Sgk gene promoter and the Sgk protein. Our current evidence has documented that Sgk plays a key role in the cell survival to extracellular stress signals. In addition to its transcriptional control, Sgk activity and localization can be regulated in a stimulus dependent manner. We are exploring the mechanism controlling the nuclear localization of Sgk in proliferating cells and its cytoplasmic localization in stressed or glucocorticoid treated cells. Furthermore, characterization of the substrate specificity of Sgk, in combination with the isolation of Sgk-interacting proteins through a yeast two-hybrid screen, has implicated Sgk as a unique convergence point for proliferative and stress signaling pathways. Our goals are to define the Sgk-mediated cell signaling events in normal and transformed cells as well as to determine the cellular functions and in vivo role of this unique kinase.</p><p> In a complementary area of research, we are investigating the opposing action of glucocorticoids and growth factors on the control of cell-cell interactions in nontransformed and transformed mammary cells. We have discovered that glucocorticoids induce tight junction formation by a multistep process under conditions in which the cells undergo a stringent growth arrest. The early events include the steroid-stimulated expression of the Id-1 transcriptional regulator, an inhibition of RhoA production and the regulation of cellular factors that interact with certain junctional complex components. Glucocorticoids induce a reorganization of the apical junctional complexes thatcauses a redistribution of the major cytoplasmic and membrane associated tight junction proteins leading to tight junction assembly. We have recently discovered that the steroid regulation of membrane organization and tight junction functionality are distinct cellular steps that can be distinguished by their dependence on Ras and RhoA signaling pathways as well as by their targeting by growth factors. We plan to define the glucocorticoid-regulated events and regulatory components that control tight junction formation in order to dissect the signaling pathways that mediate cell-cell interactions and to test their potential roles in epithelial cell tumorigenesis.</p><p> In a third major area of research, we are investigating, in collaboration with Prof. Bjeldanes' laboratory (Dept. Nutritional Sciences), the mechanism by which indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a compound produced in Brassica plants such as broccoli, suppresses the proliferation of human breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. I3C induces a G1 block in cell cycle progression through a process that selectively inhibits CDK6 (cyclin dependent kinase-6) gene expression and which is independent of the effects of estrogen. Moreover, I3C acts synergistically with tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen currently used in breast cancer therapies, to inhibit the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. One of our key goals is to define the indole signaling pathway that leads to the transcriptional control of cell cycle genes. We have recently shown that both the CDK6 promoter and CDK2 kinase activity is down regulated by I3C, and efforts are underway to define the cellular targets of I3C that mediate these anti-proliferative effects. We are also attempting to develop more potent synthetic derivatives of I3C and investigate the in vivo tumor effects of I3C to design novel classes of I3C-based anti-breast cancer and anti-prostate cancer agents. We are also investigating the anti-cancer properties of other natural compounds. </p>"

S'<p>Our laboratory has studied gene therapy for blinding, inherited diseases of the retina for the past 10 years. We have developed animal models of several inherited human blinding diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, Usher syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration. We have shown that we can protect photoreceptors from injury and cell death in these models by injecting adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors into the eye. In these experiments, we have had success in ameliorating photoreceptor cell death with a number of different neurotrophic agents, as well as ribozymes to knockdown the mutant transcripts in dominant disease. The overall goal of our research effort is to prevent or delay the course of blindness in patients. While results in the rodent models show we can protect rat photoreceptors from injury and death, these treatments are not useful for patients in later stages of retinal disease in which the photoreceptor cells have been lost.  </p><p>In collaboration with David Schaffer of the Department of Chemical Engineering, we have performed experiments to transplant hippocampal stem cells into the eye of animal models to replace lost photoreceptors. In these studies, the stem cells survive in the sub-retinal space, but do not integrate into the host retina or differentiate into photoreceptors.  It is likely that this failure to differentiate is partially due to the use of cell lines for transplant which have been subjected to multiple passages rather than stem cells from fetal tissue.  </p><p>The goal of the future experiments is to transplant fetal stem cells into the rodent models and use viral vectors to transduce the stem cells to influence their differentiation into photoreceptors. One initial candidate would be PAX6, a member of the paired box gene family that encodes a transcriptional regulator involved in oculogenesis. Other potential candidates would be rhodopsin and other members of the phototransduction cascade, as well as neurotrophins. In parallel studies, viral vectors encoding siRNA would be used to knockdown transcripts implicated in maintenance of the undifferentiated state of the fetal cells. We will apply the same paradigm for evaluating the rescue effect of stem cell transplantation on these rats that has worked well in the earlier experiments. </p><p>Currently, there is no widely accepted or effective preventive treatment for retinal degenerations.  It is clear to us that if we can replace significant numbers of photoreceptors and restore some function in an animal model of human disease, that this will hold promise for use in humans and, therefore, for a clinical trial</p>'

S'<p>INTRODUCTION: The Fleiszig Lab\'s research is focused on understanding  pathogenesis of bacterial infection, using the cornea and the  opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as model systems. Studies  are aimed at understanding the molecular factors that prevent bacterial  penetration of epithelia during health, how the functionality of that  defense system is modulated, and the bacterial factors that enable  penetration when the system is compromised. By studying the eye\'s  defensive mechanisms and determining what microbial factors involved in  initiating disease, we hope to develop therapeutics for  preventing/treating infection on multiple surfaces of the body. <br /><br />DETAIL: Our epithelial surfaces are normally resistant to infection.  Therefore, researchers who study infectious disease in vivo commonly  resort to use of models that deliberately compromise the target tissue  (or otherwise bypass barriers) so that disease can be enabled and  studied. These infection models have led to a plethora of important  information about factors involved in pathology and/or its resolution  when disease is initated. However, other models are needed to study  barriers to infection, or early events that occur prior to disease  initiation when it occurs in the absence of overt injury.  <br /><br />In our laboratory, we have developed novel in vivo and in vitro  methods for studying defenses during health using the eye and the  opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa as models. We have also  advanced imaging technologies that enable us to see into the living  epithelium to observe what bacteria do and how the tissue responds in  either resistant or susceptible states. Using these methods, and  employing array/knockout/knockdown technologies, we have identified  specific factors that modulate the ability of bacteria to penetrate the  ocular surface epithelium. The data show that pathogen recognition  systems are involved in resistance, and suggest that bacterial  adaptation in vivo contributes to pathogenesis. Studies aimed at  understanding early interactions between microbes and the ocular surface  prior to disease initiation have potential for development of novel  methods to prevent (rather than simply treat) infection of the eye or  other sites.  <br /><br />The lab is working on two inter-related goals.  <br /><br />1. To determine how the healthy corneal surface resists infection and how contact lens wear then compromises those defenses.  <br /><br />a) The laboratory\'s long standing NIH (NEI) grant is aimed at  understanding the molecular factors that prevent bacterial penetration  of the corneal epithelium when the eye is healthy, how the functionality  of that defense system is modulated, and the bacterial factors that  enable penetration when the system is compromised. Barriers to our  understanding in this area have included the lack of available in vivo  models for studying these processes. Traditionally researchers have used  "infection models" to study tissue interactions with bacteria. These  involve deliberately compromising the tissue to induce enable  susceptibility to infection, adding the microbe and then studying what  happens next. Those who study corneal infection extensively use a  scratch injury model that enables susceptibility by physically removing  the epithelial barrier to expose the vulnerable stroma. Disease follows  because direct placement of the microbe into the stroma stimulates a  damaging inflammatory response.  <br /><br />This scratch injury model is problematic for the Fleiszig  laboratory\'s research goals for two reasons. Firstly, it bypasses the  need for bacteria to penetrate the epithelium, which is the event the  laboratory seeks to understand. Secondly, the lab is interested in  understanding the events that determine health when the cornea is  resistant to infection, not events that occur when there is disease. Due  to the lack of suitable model systems, most of our knowledge about  epithelial interactions with bacteria and the potential role of the  epithelia in defense have necessarily come from cell culture studies.  <br /><br />In the past 2 years, the laboratory has succeeded in developing  multiple models (in vivo and in vitro) that enable epithelial cell  penetration by bacteria to be studied. Together, these models provide  the opportunity to do experiments either in the context of, or without,  potentially confounding factors present in vivo, as is needed to test  hypotheses. In the past year, the laboratory has also developed new  imaging technologies that enable bacterial interactions with the  epithelium to be imaged in living intact eyes without the need for any  tissue dissection, staining, or other types of sample  preparation/processing. A major equipment grant is currently pending at  the NIH; if funded the new instrumentation will enable investigators at  UC Berkeley and UCSF to non-invasively image living corneas of living  animals. With access to that equipment, there is also potential for  development of new methods for the diagnosis of human corneal disease.  <br /><br />b) A separate investigation to determine how the ocular surface  retains its sterility is newly funded by a Grand Challenges Explorations  Grant from the Gates Foundation. The long-term goal of this project is  bold: To develop therapies to prevent any type of infection of any body  site based on eye derived molecules.  <br /><br />2. Fundamental studies of bacterial/epithelial cell interactions using P. aeruginosa as a model organism.  <br /><br />This aspect of the research is funded by a new NIH grant from the  NIAID. The goal of this project is to determine how P. aeruginosa  survive inside corneal epithelial cells, and the necessity for that  strategy in the disease process. The data to date show that corneal  epithelial cells normally traffic bacteria to intracellular vesicles  where they are killed, but P. aeruginosa possesses virulence factors  that enable it to bypass this innate defense. Experimental approaches  involving biochemical and genetic methods, combined with various images  techniques, are being used to describe the details of the intimate  interactions between P. aeruginosa and eukaryotic cells. The results  will enlighten us about how bacteria cause disease and should also  contribute to our understanding of epithelial cell biology.  <br /><br />P. aeruginosa causes sight threatening pathology in the eye and life  threatening infections at other sites. These include serious lung  disease in children with cystic fibrosis and in AIDS patients, and life  theatening skin infections in burns victims. Thus, this line of research  could ultimately lead to new means for treating multiple diseases.</p>'

The major experimental tool is femtosecond spectroscopy which is combined with both theory and computer simulation to interpreted the data.  </p><p>Our goal is to provide a molecular-level description of the role of solvents in chemical reactions. The dynamics of simple reactions in solution are probed by creating wavepackets on the reaction coordinate and monitoring the progress of the reaction through the motion of the wavepacket. We are building up a description of liquids in terms of a characteristic spectral density, which itself can be interpreted in molecular terms.  </p><p>A second goal is to develop complex electric fields (pulse sequences) for two purposes: to manipulate and modify molecular dynamics, rather than simply observe it, and to provide more detailed characterizations of molecular response functions and spectral densities. For example, current techniques for measuring spectral densities relevant to Raman or optical Kerr measurements cannot distinguish between homogeneous or inhomogeneous descriptions of the spectra. Non-resonant experiments at 5th order can provide such a breakdown of the spectra, in analogy to two-dimensional nmr. Taking this analogy further, two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopies have the potential to reveal time-resolved structural information on complex systems such as proteins.  We have developed the ability to control the relative phase of sequences of ultra short pulses and plan to use this new technique to both control and study molecular dynamics.  </p><p>The primary events in photosynthesis involve energy transfer and electron transfer on ultrashort time scales. Use is made of genetic modification methods to investigate the role of the protein on these astonishingly efficient processes. Both bacterial and higher plant systems are studied with a particular current goal being to understand the mechanism of regulation of light harvesting in plants</p>'

S'<p>General interests of the laboratory concern the mechanisms of biological membrane transport and the regulation of these processes. Specific areas of research emphasis include: regulated membrane trafficking and sorting associated with secretion; recruitment and recycling of membrane transport proteins; role of cytoskeletal proteins in membrane flow and turnover; protein phosphorylation associated with stimulus-secretion coupling; structural and functional characterization of intrinsic membrane transport proteins. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Parietal cell activation represents one of the most dramatic models in which to study apical membrane remodeling associated with regulated secretion. Stimulation of these cells, in culture as in vivo, involves massive redistribution of membranes and transport enzymes from cytoplasmic vesicles to the apical plasma membrane domain. We have the means to monitor these changes structurally, biochemically and functionally. These techniques, as well as immunocytochemical probes of cytoskeletal proteins, are used to define the nature of membrane-cytoskeletal interactions that direct membrane movements to and from the cell surface. The sites, specificities, and mechanisms of the fusion reactions underlying these events of membrane recruitment are also being studied. </p><p>A second major project examines the role of protein phosphorylation in the cell activation cascade. Using the gastric acid-secreting parietal cell as a model system, we have correlated several phosphoproteins with cellular activation via cyclic AMP-mediated PKA. We now seek to establish the direct functional role of these phosphoproteins in the trafficking and recruitment of membrane transporters from a conserved inactive cytoplasmic membrane pool to the apical plasmalemma. </p><p>Another project evaluates structure-function relationships within the class of cation-tranporting P-type ATPases. We contrast two heterodimeric pump enzymes, the Na,K-ATPase, and its trafficking and functional activity at the basolateral membrane, with the H,K-ATPase, which is trafficked exclusively to the apical membrane. These proteins are studied in vitro, where conditions of interaction can be manipulated, in cell culture where variants in subunits may be expressed, and in situ where the real physiological pathways can be monitored. </p>'

S'<p>The research focus in my lab is on the behavioral ecology and community organization of solitary bee species in selected environments in California and Costa Rica. During the past 21 years we have been documenting bee diversity, seasonality, and host plant preferences of most species at several northern California sites and three sites in a seasonal dry forest in Costa Rica. For several temperate and tropical species, we are also systematically monitoring changes in annual bee frequencies and documenting the types of mortality factors that may be related to the observed fluctuations recorded.     During the past five years the research has shifted from pure wildland studies to comparative bee studies in wildlands and urban residential gardens. This shift has resulted from the discovery in my lab that urban residential areas can support high diversities of local bee species. The new work is also related to the phenomenon of global pollinator decline and the broad search for new ways to conserve and protect pollinators in a variety of habitats, including urban. New studies pursuing the comparative examination are in progress throughout California and in several sites in Costa Rica.</p>'

S'<p>Most individual projects in the Fr\xc3\xa9chet research group involve organic synthesis applied to large macromolecules for which chemical structure, architecture, and reactive group placement defines function. Our research covers both fundamental and applied aspects of organic, polymer, and materials chemistry. As a result, most projects involve three stages (i) the design stage with the development of approaches and the study of mechanisms; (ii) the synthetic stage with the preparation of model compounds and target molecules; (iii) the characterization stage with characterization of structure and properties, and the testing of function.</p><p><strong>I.</strong> Control of molecular architecture at the nanometer scale.   While most common organic molecules - "small molecules"  - have sizes well below one nanometer, macromolecules such as proteins or synthetic polymers have sizes in the nanometer range. Within this size range, it is generally very difficult to control the 3-D structure of the molecules.  Nature has learned how to achieve this with proteins and DNA but most other large synthetic macromolecules have little shape persistence and precise functional group placement is difficult. During the past decade dendrimers and other dendritic macromolecules have emerged as a major new family of well defined nanoscale building blocks.  They are globular, and sometimes almost spherical in shape, and the placement of their functional groups within the molecules can be accurately controlled.  Our synthetic work seeks new ways to prepare these molecules and to incorporate catalytic or other active sites.  In some cases we organize these reactive sites to achieve cooperative effects, while in other cases we seek to "insulate" these sites from each other, or restrict their access by external moieties, affording novel properties.   A great variety of molecular frameworks may be used and new, creative ways to assemble large and precise macromolecules are being designed and explored.</p><p><strong> II.</strong> New polymerization mechanisms: hyperbranched polymers and hybrid copolymers.    Though less precisely defined than dendrimers in terms of structure, several other families of synthetic macromolecules derive their function from a combination of shape and chemical reactivity.  We explore novel approaches for the preparation of such macromolecules.  Instead of a step-by-step approach, we seek new reaction mechanisms that provide both structural and functional control in a single step.</p><p><strong> III.</strong> Separation, molecular recognition, and reactive surfaces.   In order to exploit the power of functional surfaces in binding, recognition, and catalytic processes, we develop porous organic materials that present reactive functionalities over large contact  areas.  These materials, which generally take the form of polymer beads or macroporous monoliths, may carry a broad array of functionalities, enabling them to carry out functions such as biocatalysis, separation, or chiral recognition.  Their uses in areas such as solid-phase syntheses, combinatorial chemistry, or miniaturized "lab-on-a-chip" are also explored.</p><p><strong> IV.</strong> Functional macromolecules and their applications   Much of our research is mission oriented and many of the functional macromolecules we prepare are designed for a specific application. For example, a dendrimer with laser dyes placed at its periphery can act as a light-harvesting antenna; the same molecule fitted with a catalytic site might perform photosynthesis.  A macromolecule may be designed to act as a vector or carrier for a drug specifically "engineered"  to avoid side effects, and capable of precise delivery of its "payload"  with the help of targeting and release functionalities. A reactive polymer may be used for the sort of precision imaging that is required in the preparation of today\'s powerful microprocessors or optoelectronic devices. A macroporous polymer bead with pendant chiral groups may be perfectly suited for the analysis, recognition, or enantioseparation of biologically active molecules.</p>'

S'<p>My research focus is on fundamental questions in particle physics. The experimental techniques often involve precision measurements in atoms and nuclei for determination of Standard Model parameters and searches for unexpected phenomena. Some of these experiments have implications for astrophysics and cosmology. I am very interested in the pattern of neutrino masses and mixing and with colleagues we are conduction a large neutrino oscillation experiment in an underground laboratory in Japan.</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>Our group is based on campus and at LBNL, involving postdoctoral fellows, Nuclear-Science-Division staff members and Berkeley students. A number of projects are pursued simultaneously but a graduate students are encouraged to focus on a specific experiment as a thesis topic. Some projects are done in collaboration with other groups. Ph.D. students are expected to play a principal role in all stages of the dissertation project from conception to final analysis.</p><p>We are exploiting atomic physics techniques for cooling and trapping atoms with lasers and in precision studies of nuclear beta-decay at the LBNL 88\xe2\x80\x9d cyclotron. Atomic properties of the 22-sec isotope 21Na have been measured with trapped atoms. Measurements of the electron-neutrino correlation have reached the 1% level. These measurements are tests of how precisely the weak interaction is described by a pure V \xe2\x80&#147; A theory as expected in the Standard Model. The method will be used to measure other decay correlations in 21Na and in other nuclear systems.</p><p>A precision measurement of the weak vector coupling constant form the pure Fermi decay of 10C was recently completed using Gammasphere a sophisticated array of high resolution Ge gamma-ray detectors. This measurement helps determine an element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark-mixing matrix. With data from other experiments with Kaons and B-mesons we are testing the structure of the C-K-M matrix and its consistency with the Standard Model. A neutron-decay experiment studying time reversal symmetry was the subject of a recent thesis from our group. This experiment runs at the NIST reactor in Gaithersburg. The experiment is being improved and eventually it will be taken to the Institute Laue-Langevin reactor in Grenoble, France. Another neutron experiment is being prepared at the LANSCE neutron spallation facility at Los Alamos. We will measure the gamma-ray asymmetry in polarized neutron capture on hydrogen, providing a measurement of the extremely small parity-violation nucleon-nucleon force due to the neutral weak current. </p><p>Studies of the beta decay 14O are underway using new radioactive beam techniques developed at the 88\xe2\x80\x9d cyclotron. This apparatus now produces the most intense 14O beam in the world. These experiments have implications for a feature of the Standard Model called the conserved vector current hypothesis. In the future the 14O machine may be applied to measurements of critical cross sections for astrophysics. Measurements of the decay of 8B being at Argonne National Laboratory and Berkeley are pinning down the precise shape of the neutrino spectrum. This information is critical for understanding the neutrino spectrum from the Sun, important input for solving the so-called solar neutrino problem.</p><p>In collaboration with Professor Budker\xe2\x80\x99s groups we are working toward a precise measurement of the Weinberg angle with a measurement of atomic parity mixing in Yb. The preliminary experiment in this program is the subject of a Ph.D. thesis that will be completed soon.</p><p>Our groups\xe2\x80\x99 largest project is connected with a new neutrino detector that is being constructed at Kamioka, Japan. Called KamLAND, consisting of one thousand tons of liquid scintillator viewed by two thousand photomultiplier tubes it constitutes the largest scintillation detector ever to be built underground. It is used in a long-baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment with enough sensitivity to confirm one of the possible solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle. The detector is large enough to detect solar neutrinos from 7Be electron-capture neutrinos from supernovae, and neutrinos from radioactive elements with the Earth.</p>'

S'<p>Our research is devoted to measurement and description of electroencephalographic (EEG) and unit activity of cortex that occurs during goal-directed behavior. Behaviorally relevant information is carried by spatial patterns of amplitude modulation of oscillations in the beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) ranges. These patterns are formed by phase transitions that are triggered in the cortex by sensory input in frames at theta frequencies (2-7 Hz). Behavioral testing has shown that amplitude patterns of gamma activity are vehicles for the creating and refinement of meaning. The same algorithms hold for olfactory, visual, auditory and somatic cortexes. These spatial patterns depend on expectations that are shaped by the limbic system using corollary discharges, as the basis for attention and consciousness, and by the history of experience with stimuli that is embedded in the cortical neuropil by synaptic modifications due to learning. We model the dynamics of the cortex with networks of nonlinear differential equations. The solutions to these equations show the existence of equilibrium, limit cycle and chaotic attractors, which we display with interactive graphics. The model performs with outstanding efficacy the basic functions of cortex in perception: abstraction, generalization, and classification.</p>'

S'<p>My primary interests reside in the area of comparative biomechanics and physiology. My research program quantifies whole animal performance in general and locomotion in particular as it relates to an animal\'s structure, physiology, and behavior. We use biomechanical, computer simulation (dynamic musculo-skeletal modeling), physical modeling (robot and artificial muscle construction), isolated muscle, biochemical, whole-animal exercise physiology and field-tracking techniques to seek general design principles for species which have evolved different solutions to the problems of locomotion and activity in general. The study of arthropod, amphibian and reptilian locomotion continues to offer an excellent opportunity for comparison. Animals such as crabs, cockroaches, ants, beetles, scorpions, centipedes, geckos and salamanders show tremendous variation in body shape, gas transport system, leg number, musculoskeletal arrangement and mode of movement. <br /><br />Diversity enables discovery. We use these "novel" biological designs as natural experiments to probe for basic themes concerning the relationship between morphology, body size, energetics, dynamics, control, stability, maneuverability, maximum speed and endurance. An understanding of the diverse biological solutions to the problems of locomotion contributes to the development of a general theory of&nbsp; energetics, neuro-mechanics and behavior. We collaborate closely with engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists by providing biological principles to inspire the design of multi-legged robots, artificial limbs and muscles, novel control algorithms, and self-cleaning, dry adhesives.</p>'

In his work on decentralizing policy, he shows how school reforms often fail to accomplish these changes, leading him to institutional and political questions around how to construct more effective policies. He pursues these topics in cross-cultural settings, ranging from Latino communities of east Boston to impoverished communities in South Africa.'

S'<p>The climate of the Earth is intimately tied to the composition of the atmosphere and the dynamics of the underlying surface. The atmosphereand land surface exchange energy, water and other trace substances on allspace and time scales. The exchange is dependent on and, in turn, determines the states of the atmosphere and biosphere themselves. My research in the past decade has focused on the many aspects of  biosphere-atmosphere interaction, with the goal of gaining predictive capability of how atmospheric composition may evolve in the future.My principal tool is the fully coupled  atmosphere-land-ocean-ice Community Climate System Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, to which we have added an interactive carbon cycle.  A current research focus is the interaction between the carbon cycle and changing climate and circulation, to understand ifthese interactions act to accelerate global warming.</p>'

Supersymmetry provides a possible mechanism for understanding the large hierarchy in scale between the masses of particles studied with accelerators and the &amp;#039;natural&amp;#039; scale of physics which is the Planck mass. Supergravity, particularly when regarded as the &amp;#039;low energy&amp;#039; limit of superstring theory, provides the best hope at present for unification of all forces.

S'<p>The work in our laboratory focuses on computational modeling of the visual system. Our goal is to formulate models that describe how the brain encodes visual information, and that accurately predict how the brain responds during natural vision. We study the visual system because it is more approachable than the cognitive systems that mediate complex thought.</p><p>The human visual system consists of a hierarchically organized, highly interconnected network of several dozen distinct areas. Each area can be viewed as a computational module that represents different aspects of the visual scene. Some areas process the simple structural features of a scene, such as the edge orientation, local motion and texture. Others process complex semantic features, such as faces, animals and places. Our laboratory focuses on discovering the way each of these areas represents the visual world, and on how these multiple representations are modulated by attention, learning and memory. Because the human visual system is exquisitely adapted to process natural images and movies we focus most of our effort on natural stimuli.</p><p>One way to think about visual processing is in terms of neural coding. Each visual area encodes certain information about a visual scene, and that information must be decoded by downstream areas. Both encoding and decoding processes can, in theory, be described by an appropriate computational model of the stimulus-response mapping function of each area. Therefore, our descriptions of visual function are posed in terms of quantitative computational encoding models. However, once an accurate encoding model has been developed, it is fairly straightforward to convert it into a decoding model that can be used to read out brain activity, in order to classify, identify or reconstruct mental events. In the popular press this is often called \xe2\x80\x9cbrain reading\xe2\x80\x9d. Our laboratory has a large brain reading program, which you can read about elsewhere on this site.</p><p>Much of the work in our laboratory involves functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a rapidly developing technique for making non-invasive measurements of brain activity. Because the accuracy of encoding and decoding models will inevitably depend on the quality of brain activity measurements, we have a large research program that is concerned with developing new methods for collecting and processing large, high-quality fMRI datasets. Our computational models leverage many different statistical and machine learning tools, including nonlinear system identification, Bayesian estimation theory and information theory. Therefore we also undertake fundamental research on statistical methods and estimation theory.</p>'

S'<p>We are interested in how nervous systems develop and are studying how asymmetric cell division, cell migration and axonal pathfinding contribute to the final form and connectivity of the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Asymmetric neuroblast divisions.</i> Nervous systems contain many different types of neurons. One way to generate this diversity is for neuroblasts to divide asymmetrically, producing daughter cells that adopt distinct fates. We have been studying two proteins, HAM-1 and PIG-1, which function in several neuroblasts that divide to generate apoptotic cells and neural precursors. HAM-1 is novel protein that is asymmetrically distributed in these neuroblasts, and PIG-1 is a homolog of MELK, a conserved kinase that is expressed in all neural progenitors of the mouse brain. Both proteins regulate the position of the neuroblast cleavage plane and the distribution of developmental potential to daughter cells. Genetic screens have identified signaling pathways that are involved in some of the same asymmetric cell divisions that require HAM-1 and PIG-1, and we are currently testing whether these pathways regulate HAM-1 and PIG-1.</p><p><i>Cell and growth cone migrations.</i> Cell migrations shape nervous system structure, and axonal growth cone migrations contribute to nervous system connectivity. To understand how these migrations are regulated, we screened for mutants with defects in migrations of the CAN and HSN neurons, cells that migrate in opposite directions along the anteroposterior (A/P) axis.</p><p>We are particularly interested in molecules that regulate migrations along the A/P axis. Our current model proposes that guidance along this axis is regulated by the activity of several signaling pathways that interact to control both direction and final destinations of migrating cells and growth cones.  VAB-8, a novel kinesin-like protein that is both necessary and sufficient for posteriorly directed cell and growth cone migrations, functions globally to promote these migrations. The conserved kinase UNC-51 appears to regulate the activity of VAB-8 and a second molecule, UNC-14, by phosphorylation. Molecular genetic experiments suggest that VAB-8 promotes cell and growth cone migrations by regulating the activity of several guidance receptors. We also have found that Wnts, secreted glycoproteins that have been shown to function in several different developmental processes, promote the anterior migrations of cells and growth cones. The effects of the Wnts are mediated by Frizzled receptors and Dishevelled signaling proteins, and we are currently attempting to identify the molecules that function downstream of Dishevelled.</p>'

S"Maryl Gearhart's research focuses on professional development strategies to support teachers' interpretation of student thinking in mathematics and science. As a developmental psychologist and preservice elementary educator, she focuses most of her research on K-6 education. She is currently investigating the role of a reflective assessment portfolio in science teachers' developing expertise with classroom assessment, and has previously investigated other professional development strategies, including 'looking at student work' and analyses of video examples of children's mathematical problem solving."

S"<p>Prof. Geissler's research concerns the microscopic behavior of complex biological and material systems. Using the tools and concepts of statistical mechanics, he and his group will develop theories and simplified models for chemical phenomena (e.g., the transport of protons in ice), for biomolecular structure and dynamics (e.g., response and design of a protein's external surface), and for the role of fluctuations in nanoscale materials (e.g., the effects of finite size on structural transitions in nanocrystals). His students will also use and devise modern techniques of computer simulation to investigate such systems on atomic length scales.</p><p>His group will interact closely with experimental researchers in order both to inspire and to be inspired by state-of-the-art studies of real physical systems. As a postdoctoral fellow, Prof. Geissler collaborated with experimentalists to interpret results of nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy in terms of molecular motions, underscoring the importance of collective motions in liquid water.</p><p>He and his coworkers recently formulated a lattice model for the self-assembly of nanoparticles in an evaporating thin film solution. Numerical simulations of this model exhibited a wide variety of intricate patterns in space and in time (such as those in figure below). These results revealed the physical origins of structures observed in experiments and pointed to new and potentially useful aggregate morphologies. </p>"

S'<p>My research interests are in experimental astrophysics. My research group and I are studying the physical processes and the evolution of active galaxies and in particular of their central regions. One key issue we have been pursuing is the question whether the accretion onto massive black holes, or star formation powers active and luminous galaxies. For instance, in one class of very luminous galaxies we were recently able to demonstrate from mid-infrared spectroscopy on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) that enormous bursts of star formation triggered by the collision of galaxies can produce quasar-like luminosities in the infrared. Such galaxies were apparently much more common in the past than in the local Universe. We are also engaged in testing the paradigm that active galactic nuclei indeed all contain massive black holes. In the nucleus of our own Galaxy we were able to show from near-infrared imaging observations of the motions of individual stars in the central few light days that there must be a million solar mass, central black hole. Such key science goals have been driving our experimental program. We have been developing novel instrumentation, mainly in the infrared and submillimeter range, for large ground-based, airborne and space telescopes. We have been developing sensitive infrared spectrometers and imagers across the entire 1-1000mm band. We are active in the area of adaptive optics with laser stars.</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>We want to push our studies to ever smaller spatial scales and to ever larger distances, reaching galaxies that were formed in the first few billion years after the Big Bang. Using the new generation of 10m class, ground based telescopes (such as the Keck telescope) together with the new techniques of adaptive optics and interferometry, near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy will be able in the next decade to zoom into the innermost cores of nearby active galaxies. Such high resolution techniques will reveal whether central black holes are present, how they are fed and whether/how stars are formed there. At larger distances it will be possible, for example, to study quantitatively the dynamics of colliding/merging galaxies. Mergers are a key process in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Finally the high resolution observations also make possible spatially resolved studies of the first galaxies formed at high redshift. In the next few years we are planning to carry out infrared observations on these subjects (on the Keck and the ESO VLT) on a broad front and in part with instruments that we are now building.  We also will push the capability of far-infrared/submillimeter observations. We are engaged in building a sensitive far-infrared imaging spectrometer for the new SOFIA airborne observatory that will house a 2.5m telescope in a B747 aircraft. With SOFIA it will be possible to study the far-infrared emission of distant star forming galaxies and reveal their activity independent of the effects of dust obscuration that hampers or makes impossible measurements at shorter wavelengths. </p><p>Sensitive astronomical measurements require state of the art radiation detectors. We have begun an ambitious program of developing Ga:As photoconductor detectors. Ga:As detectors promise to substantially extend the wavelength cutoff of present Ge detectors into the submillimeter band, and at the same time, they may be developed into monolithic, large pixel size formats. Our development aims at a blocked impurity band device that could be used on SOFIA or future space missions. </p>'

S'<p>We study the early development of the amphibian <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, particularly the development of Spemann\'s organizer, which induces most dorsal and anterior structures of the embryonic body axis, those most characteristic of the chordate phylum.</p><p> We study cortical rotation, a 30\xc2\xb0 shift of the surface layer of the single-celled egg relative to the cytoplasmic core during the first cell cycle after fertilization. The direction of rotation is predictive of the site in the egg from which the organizer and dorsal structures develop. If rotation is blocked, the egg forms no organizer and develops as a radially symmetric "invertebrate" embryo with only a gut, red blood cells, and a ciliated epidermis. A dense array of parallel microtubules, which forms in the vegetal cortex of the normal egg, serves as tracks for rotation of the cortex. Rotation aligns these microtubules. Vesicles, organelles, and presumably informational molecules move along the array, from the vegetal pole to the equator on the future clorsal side. We seek to identity of the key vegetal materials (a beta-catenin-stabilizing agent is the current leading candidate) and in the means of transport.</p><p> The second step of organizer formation occurs at the 4000-cell blastula stage. Cells of the dorsal vegetal region of the cleaved egg induce neighboring cells to form a portion of the organizer, as demonstrable by cell transplantation experiments. We seek to identify two secreted materials of this meso-endoderm induction, one maternal and one zygotic, the latter released by those cells receiving high beta-catenin levels from egg cytoplasm specialized by cortical rotation. </p>'

S'<p>Our main goal is to construct computational models of the human visual system based on its measured abilities (psychophysics) and known architecture (neurophysiology and anatomy). These models use mainly neural network methods which can be simulated with conventional computers and ultimately implemented in specially-built hardware to run in \xe2\x80\x9creal time.\xe2\x80\x9d The models are designed to mimic as closely as possible the real anatomy and physiology of the human visual system and are not like any of the more conventional neural networks in common use. They are expected to give insights into the workings of the human brain when it is engaged in visual tasks and to make predictions about the response of the human visual system to real world images as well as to artificial laboratory stimuli. These models can also serve to endow robots or computer vision systems with the same or better abilities, especially if the models are implemented in special-purpose highly parallel hardware using architectures found in the brain.</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>Psychophysical experiments usually involve presenting carefully designed patterns on computer monitors to observers who are asked to report their judgments of such things as depth, color, velocity, flow, identity of an object, texture boundaries, or simply the presence or absence of a signal. Recently we have found that both depth and speed of motion judgments in a small local region are grossly affected by image features quite far away from the local region of attention. Similar effects are known for color and texture. We are therefore putting much effort into exploring these local-global interactions and building neural net models in which purely local node-to-node interactions have global perceptual consequences and in which information gathered from the whole image affects local perceptions.</p><p>Since these and many other visual processes are very complex and highly non-linear, conventional mathematical methods offer little hope of providing a useful bridge between psychophysics and neurobiology. Neural network models are therefore constructed using as much as practical of all we know of the psychophysics and neurophysiology of the situation. They are further provided with the ability to learn or adapt by changing their structure in response to repeated exposure to the relevant visual stimuli. In this way the nets \xe2\x80\x9cimprove themselves\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the explicit knowledge used to construct them and sometimes give further insights which we hope will be useful in guiding further psychophysical and neurophysiological studies.</p>'

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jack Glaser is a social psychologist whose primary research interest is instereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.  He studies these intergroup biases at multiple levels of analysis. He is also interested in the police practice of racial profiling, especially as it relates to the psychology of stereotyping, and the self-fulfilling effects of such stereotype-based discrimination.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Another area of interest is in electoral politics and political ideology.  He is specifically interested in the role of emotion (as experienced and expressed) in politics, and in the psychological underpinnings of liberalism and conservatism.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>In recent years, my research has focused on hormonal substrates of behavior and morphology in spotted hyenas, with particular attention to issues of sexual differentiation. Female spotted hyenas are the most highly "masculinized" of extant female mammals, in terms of genital development. Also, within their natural social groups, adult females are highly aggressive and totally dominate adult males during social interactions. Through the study of a colony of hyenas maintained at the Field Station for Behavioral Research in the hills above the Berkeley campus, and close coordination with field researchers, we (this is a joint project with Professor Paul Licht) have been pursuing a variety of questions concerning, e.g., the role of naturally circulating androgens on sexual differentiation and behavior in female and male mammals. </p><p>Graduate students working with me have studied aspects of vertebrate behavior in a variety of species (e.g., kangaroo rats, woodrats, grasshopper mice, ground squirrels and, occasionally, hyenas) in both field and laboratory settings. These studies have sometimes been of a purely behavioral nature, while on other occasions, they have involved neural and/or hormonal substrates of behavior.</p>'

This collaborative work which started with theconstruction of the SLAC-LBL Solenoidal Magnetic Detector has led to the discoveryof the J/psi (3095) and psi (3685) particles, charmed particles, in particular the Dmesons, as well as the tau lepton, and the elucidation of the psion spectroscopy.</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>Since 1990, I have been working in Particle Astrophysics together with SaulPerlmutter. This work involves the study of distant Supernovae. In 1998 wediscovered the most distant Supernova observed so far at a distance of about 9billion light years. From December 1993 to September 2008, more than 150 additionaltype Ia supernovae were discovered, some of them the most distant ever observed, outto a redshift of 1.4.</p><p>The aim of this experiment is to measure the matter density Omega_M and the vacuumenergy density Omega_Lambda (related to the cosmological constant Lambda) of theuniverse by utilizing type Ia supernovae. The type Ia supernovae are the brightestSNe and also appear to be \xe2\x80\x9cStandard candles.\xe2\x80\x9d As demonstrated in our experiment,they can be observed at cosmological distances.</p><p>We have completed an analysis of 42 supernovae which gave us the information thatthe expansion of the universe rather than slowing down, as was expected, is actuallyaccelerating! We find for a flat universe, one for which Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1,that Omega_M is about 1/3, while the value expected was 1, and that the cosmologicalconstant is about 2/3, when zero was expected. We are continuing these measurementswith the aim of finding more distant supernovae with the 10 meter Keck telescope inHawaii and to make more accurate measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope. Thereis an opportunity for graduate student participation in this work.</p>'

S"<p>My research is on the use of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) technology to monitor and map natural resources and human settlements. Computer based pattern recognition, statistical analysis, mathematical modeling are studied for the extraction of information from imagery data acquired by sensors in the field or on board of aircraft and satellites. My goal is to develop effective and efficient methods that provide spatial information or spatial evidence to scientists, policy makers and decision makers. Such information can be used to better understand environmental changes, to make better policies for environmental protection, and to form wiser decisions on the use of our resources for sustainable development of human society. </p><p>My specific interests include computer recognition of forest species based on both morphological and spectral information in remotely sensed data; estimating biophysical and biochemical parameters from forest lands through processing and analysis of hyperspectral data; land-cover and land-use classification and change detection at various spatial scales; integrated analysis of multisource data of our environment from census, field survey, remote sensing, and maps; uncertainties in digital map data and knowledge-based geographic information systems. </p><p><i><b>Current Projects </b></i>, 1. We propose a research field called, Photo-Ecometrics, the science and technology using digital image analysis and spectral analysis for precise ecological measurements. We focus on forest inventory, crown reconstruction, biophysical and biochemical data and species recognition. Projects are funded by NASA, USDA and the NSF of China. , , 2. The development of algorithms for forest fire monitoring and mapping, fire emission estimation. We have been awarded a 3-year NASA project to map the historical fires of North American's temperate and boreal forest from 1985-2000 with NOAA satellite data. , , 3.

S"T<p>The research in Professor Gong's lab has been directed to study molecular and cellular mechanisms that control vertebrate organgenesis and diseases, mainly, the eye development and diseases, by using multidiscipline techniques from the fields of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and electrophysiology etc. We are interesting in the studies of identification and characterization of novel genetic factors that play essential roles in the development and diseases of the eye as well as the studies of using these disease models to develop novel biological and or chemical tools to diagnose, prevent and/or cure related eye diseases.</p><p>We have generated or identified many mouse mutant lines that developed different eye diseases like retinal degeneration, vitreous defects, lens cataracts, corneal dystrophies etc. from a screening of an ENU-induced mouse mutagenesis program by clinical examinations using an indirect ophthalmoscope and a slit lamp, as well as gene-knockout and transgenic approaches. Their ocular phenotypes are characterized morphologically and biochemically. Defined genetic mutations are subjected to chromosomal mapping of their mutations using a genome wide mapping strategy. The goal of the studies is to identify the genes that play essential role(s) in normal eye development as well as in diseases. Some of the mouse mutations are very likely to be the models for related human eye diseases. Therefore, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to use these models to develop novel biological or chemical tools to diagnose, prevent and/or cure related eye diseases. </p><p>Current projects are mainly focusing on the studies of development and diseases that are related to retina, lens and vasculature in the eye.</p>"

S'<p>Research in the Graves group focuses on the fundamentals and applications of weakly to partially ionized gases, or plasmas, to technological problems. Recently, the Graves group has flcused its interests primarily on biological and medical applications of plasmas. These plasmas operate at relatively low gas temperatures - around room temperature - and are therefore quite different from the hot, usually strongly magnetized plasmas in stars or that are used in thermonuclear fusion and weapons applications. The key problems in this field are related to the coupling of the chemically reactive neutral gas and electrons and ions that make up the plasma. This is especially true at surfaces exposed to the plasma. Indeed the primary applications of interest to the Graves group are related to interactions between the plasma and its bounding surfaces, especially those that involve biological fluid phases.</p>'

S'<p>Inflammation is a highly regulated and elegant response to injury,   stress and infection. At any given time in life there are multiple sites   of healthy and temporary inflammation that often go unnoticed in   tissue/organs such as skin, gastrointestinal tract, mouth, eyes, blood   vessels and lungs. More importantly, inflammation is essential to health   and survival of all living organisms. Healthy inflammation protects a   wound against invading bacteria/viruses, removes dead tissue and cells   and regulates the repair of injured or stressed tissue. By design a   healthy inflammatory response is beneficial, temporary, resolves   naturally, and restores normal function of the afflicted tissue/organ.    Unfortunately, the complex regulation of healthy inflammation is in a   precarious balance that can tip towards causing unwanted tissue damage   and lead to abnormal or chronic inflammation. Diet, overall state of   health, and environmental factors can tip healthy inflammation to an   uncontrolled and disease causing inflammatory events. Dysregulated   inflammation is now recognized as a major factor in the global disease   burden and the cause of cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, heart   attacks, stroke), asthma, arthritis, allergies, cancer and blindness.<br /><br />Traditionally therapeutic approaches have focused simply on  inhibiting  pathways that initiate or amplify inflammation, which can  lead to  significant and potentially dangerous side effects. Research  efforts in  the Gronert Laboratory are part of a new paradigm that has  established  lipid circuits as critical regulators for the successful  execution of a  normal healthy inflammatory response. These lipid  circuits are  essential components of a \xe2\x80\x9cresolution program\xe2\x80\x9d that helps  remodel  injured tissue, removes spend white bloods cells and naturally   terminates the inflammatory response. Intense research efforts in the   last few years and high profile publications by a small group of   research teams around the world has spurred enormous interest in these   resident protective lipid circuits as a major target for the development   of much needed novel drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.   Our research team is focused on elucidating the role of these  endogenous  protective circuits in inflammation and wound healing and to  define  their critical regulation by dietary omega-3 PUFA (fish oils).  Karsten  Gronert was a member of the research team that discovered that  Fish oils  (omega-3 PUFA) are converted to specific protective lipid  signals in  the body. These findings have provided a molecular mechanism  for the  remarkable beneficial actions of dietary omega-3 PUFA, which  has eluded  scientist for decades.<br /><br />Research project in the laboratory  employ innovative approaches and  state-of-the art technology to  discover and define the endogenous role  of protective lipid circuits in  the body and cells with the long-term  goal to identify novel drug  targets or treatment options for  inflammatory diseases. Our main  research project is sponsored by the  National Eye Institute and is  focused on elucidating the formation and  molecular mechanisms of  protective lipid signals in the sequelae of  ocular injury. Our research  efforts in the last few years have uncovered  that protective lipid  mediator circuits and \xe2\x80\x9cresolution programs\xe2\x80\x9d are  highly and selectively  expressed in the delicate visual axis. Current  efforts are aimed at  defining the role and regulation of these intrinsic  protective pathways  and \xe2\x80\x9cresolution program\xe2\x80\x9d in normal ocular  physiology and inflammatory  diseases.<br /><br />In addition, the Gronert  laboratory collaborates with  leading research teams at Children\xe2\x80\x99s  Hospital/Harvard Medical School,  Charit\xc3\xa9 University Clinic in Germany  and the National Institute for  Digestive and Diabetes and Kidney Disease  to define the role and  molecular mechanisms of action for omega-3 lipid  circuits in healthy  humans and human patients with multiple sclerosis  or inflammatory  diseases as well as in experiments that model the  leading causes of  blindness.</p>'

S'Cells interact with each other and their environment through myriad membrane associated receptors and signaling molecules. In addition to individual receptor-ligand binding, spatial rearrangement of receptors into complex patterns is rapidly emerging as a broadly significant aspect of cell recognition. We are mounting a quantitative investigation of the physical characteristics and principles governing molecular reorganization events during initial stages of cellular recognition and signaling. The basic problem to be addressed is the collective interaction between populations of receptors and ligands in two apposed fluid membranes. We wish to understand how the binding kinetics, lateral mobility of the membrane proteins, membrane bending effects, etc. influence molecular organization and recognition. Our approach is aimed toward elucidating how these physico-chemical parameters determine the formation of spatio-temporal patterns at cell signaling junctions. A three-pronged investigative platform which combines novel membrane experiments in reconstituted lipid membranes and cell biology with theoretical calculations and computer simulations has been formulated to meet our goals. In the experimental aspect of this project, we are utilizing a variety of supported membrane configurations to examine spontaneous pattern formation in a controlled setting. The use of supported membrane systems is an especially powerful aspect of these studies in that micron and nanometer-scale structures can be fabricated onto the substrate and used to confine and control the fluid membrane in practically any desired geometry. In addition to our studies of processes in cellular membranes, we are developing a variety of hybrid bio-solidstate devices which incorporate fluid membranes. The basic goal is to construct chip-based components which can manipulate, control, and measure membranes and associated molecules. We employ a range of microfabrication techniques including photo- and electron-beam lithography to fabricate micron- and nanometer-scale structures which interface with fluid membranes.'

S'<p>My research focuses primarily on the study of prehistoric Jomon hunter-gatherers on the Japanese archipelago. This research interest has led me to incorporate several different aspects of anthropological studies and other related fields into my research, including hunter-gatherer archaeology, settlement archaeology, pottery analysis and East Asian studies. To pursue these research interests, I have sought collaborations with specialists in zooarchaeology, palaeoethnobotany, geochemistry, radiocarbon chronology and others. In terms of theoretical approaches, I have tended to adopt an ecological framework with an emphasis on the study of subsistence and settlement, while not dismissing the importance of non-ecological factors such as historical contingency and human agency. Because I was born and originally trained in Japan, and subsequently studied in Canada at McGill University to obtain my Ph.D. degree, I am committed to promoting active interactions between different academic traditions, particularly those of Japan and North America. Coming from Asia to North America, and having worked in Japanese archaeology where only 2.7% of professional archaeologists are women, I am a strong supporter of the inclusion of people from marginalized groups, including women, in academia.</p><p>To pursue my interests in understanding the mechanisms of the development of cultural complexity among prehistoric hunter-gatherers, in 1997 I launched a field project at the Jomon period Sannai Maruyama site in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan. The primary purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between the degree of sedentism, subsistence strategies and social complexity of the site occupants during the Early and Middle Jomon periods. The site was initially excavated by the Board of Education of Aomori Prefecture between 1992 and 1994, and was subsequently designated as a national historic site. Previous excavation has revealed that the site is associated with a large number of features and artifacts dated to approximately 5900-4300 cal B.P. In collaboration with The Preservation Office of the Sannai Maruyama Site, I conducted approximately two weeks of fieldwork every summer to collect data for the following five inter-related projects:</p><p>1) analysis of faunal and floral remains from the site (with Mr. Komiya, Museum of Natural History, Chiba),&nbsp;<br />2) analysis of intra-site lithic assemblage variability,<br />3) analysis of regional settlement patterns and inter-site lithic assemblage variability in the site vicinity,<br />4) carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human skeletal remains in northern Japan (with Dr. Chisholm, Lecturer of the Univ. of British Columbia), and<br />5) anthropological investigation of the relationships between archaeological research and public presentation (with Dr. Fawcett, Associate Professor of St. Francis Xavier Univ.).</p><p>My other on-going research includes (1) analysis of regional settlement pattern data in central Japan, (2) X-ray fluorescence analysis of Jomon pottery, and (3) comparative study of Jomon data with hunter-gatherers in other parts of the North Pacific Region, (4) examination of the socio-political contexts of archaeological studies in East Asia, and (5) historical archaeology of East Asia, particularly the archaeology of the Edo period (1603-1868) in Japan.</p>'

S'<p>What are the fundamental symmetries of nature, and how are they broken?</p><p>The standard model of particle physics, while very successful, leaves many fundamental questions unanswered. These questions frequently have to do with symmetries: could certain aspects of particles and their interactions be better understood in terms of a new symmetry? How are these new symmetries, and indeed many of the symmetries of the standard model, to be broken? The symmetry of the electroweak interaction would imply that there is no difference between the left-handed neutrino and the left-handed electron! These particles differ only because the symmetry is broken \xe2\x80&#148; and yet we do not know how this symmetry breaking occurs. The difference between the masses of the electron and the muon are a sign that flavor symmetries are broken; but again, the origin is unknown. It is remarkable that we can address such problems, and that in the coming decade we shall find out the answers to at least some of the fundamental questions of symmetry breaking.</p><p>In recent years I have constructed and studied theories with enhanced spacetime symmetries: weak scale supersymmetry, and compact extra spatial dimensions with size from sub-mm to inverse TeV to inverse Planck mass. I have worked on grand unified theories in four and higher dimensions, and have considered a variety of frameworks for neutrino masses.</p><p>I continue to study constrained theories for the quark and charged lepton masses.Whether the electroweak symmetry turns out to be broken by the effects of supersymmetric interactions, a new strong force, or by extra spatial dimensions, the elucidation of the TeV scale will be as exciting as any previous discoveries in particle physics.</p><p>The cosmos apparently contains both dark energy and dark matter, contributing in roughly equal amounts to a critical universe. These contents of the universe, as well as the asymmetric baryons and background photons, arise from the underlying theory of particle and gravitational interactions. For all its successes, the standard model of particle physics does not allow the computation of the density of any of these components of the universe. What theory will?</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>My recent work has concentrated on the physics of extra spatial dimensions. I have constructed a supersymmetric theory with a fifth dimension at the TeV scale which is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. This allows a prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson and for the pattern of the masses of the superpartners and KK resonances. I continue to pursue extra-dimensional theories of the weak scale.</p><p>I have introduced a new framework for grand unification, in which the unified symmetry is realized only in higher dimensions and the higher dimensional field theory allows a precise calculation of the weak mixing angle. Such theories have new possibilities for understanding gauge symmetry breaking, quark and lepton masses and proton decay. The Higgs boson does not seem to fit naturally in the standard model. I am pursuing the possibility that it is not a fundamental spin zero particle at all, but originates from components of a gauge field in higher dimensions.</p><p>Why are the lepton flavor mixing angles large while those in the quark sector are small? I am pursuing a variety of ideas to explain this quark-lepton asymmetry. Possible schemes for large mixing between the tau neutrino and the muon neutrino were explored in.</p><p>Cosmological data suggest that we live in an interesting period in the history of the universe when the matter, radiation and vacuum contributions to the energy density are broadly comparable. The occurrence of any epoch with such a \xe2\x80\x9ctriple coincidence\xe2\x80\x9d is puzzling, and yet it appears that we happen to live during this special epoch. I have recently proposed why this might be so, and am following this up with a study of theories which lead to such interesting times.</p>'

S"<p>The empirical basis of my research has been the history and ethnography of Yucatan Mexico, where I have conducted about 30 months of fieldwork and archival research. My speciality is Yucatec Maya language and culture and all of my fieldwork has been conducted in Maya language. I have become increasingly interested in early modern Spain and Spanish as a necessary step towards understanding the colonial formation of Yucatan and New Spain. </p><p>My work is oriented towards three areas, and the theoretical frameworks needed to understand them. The first is the organization and dynamics of routine language use (semantics, pragmatics, interactional sociolinguistics and the social foundations of speech practices). Here I have been particularly concerned with how people make reference to, describe and orient themselves in space. My first book (1990) was a study of lived space in contemporary Maya interaction and the contribution of demonstratives and deictics to communicative practice. The second area in which I have done sustained fieldwork is shamanism. This began with an extended collaboration with a contemporary Maya shaman in Yucatan, and has led me to study ritual practice, comparative shamanisms, and the relations between religion and health care in rural Mexico. The third focus of my work is the colonial history of Yucatan and New Spain, with a special emphasis on missionization and the emergence of colonial discourse genres. The latter include a wide range of evangelical texts in Maya, the grammars, dictionaries and other analytic works by missionaries in Yucatan, as well as a substantial corpus of texts authored by native Maya speakers (notarial documents as well as so called 'indigenous genres'). Among the key concepts engaged in this work are translation, religious conversion, semantic change, discourse genres and social fields. </p>"

S'<p>We address the role of signaling between cells in early vertebrate development.  Our main focus is on the function of BMPs and their antagonists in establishing cell identities in early development, but we also focus on the integration of the signaling mediated by Smads 1 and 2, beta-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinases (activated by BMP, Nodal, Wnts and FGFs respectively) in the early embryo. These pathways mediate mesodermal and neural induction and the initial patterning and morphogenesis of both the mesoderm and neural plate. After the embryonic axes and germ layers are defined the signals are redeployed during organogenesis.  We have discovered new signaling molecules and mechanisms by using gain of function experiments in the frog Xenopus.  We then exploit both amphibian and mammalian models to manipulate signaling, and use embryological and genetic techniques to understand the mechanisms by which the signals elicit particular cell fates in the embryo.  In mammals we have documented the importance of BMP antagonists in the development of the somites and neural tube, and in the formation and organization of the limbs and skeleton.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Axis formation and Neural induction.</i> Pattern formation in vertebrate embryos proceeds by a series of cell-cell interactions, or inductions. These inductions activate signal transduction pathways to change gene expression. The embryo is very sensitive to small changes in signaling, so that interesting bioactivities can be detected by their effects on embryonic phenotype. Starting with cDNA libraries made from embryos, we inject synthetic mRNA from small pools of library, and assay either embryo morphology or gene expression. Such functional assays allow us to find genes that we can then study to understand the molecular basis for embryonic inductions. </p><p>These screens have isolated various molecules that participate in embryonic signaling. Some encode secreted proteins, that either bind to receptors and activate signal transduction pathways, while some block the activity of other signaling molecules. One such molecule, Noggin, can act as a direct neural inducer, and illustrates the principle that blocking a signal can be as informative to cell fate as activating a pathway. Noggin and other similar molecules interact with yet other signals to produce the full range of neural cell types. </p><p>While there is an overall understanding of signaling pathways that contribute to formation of the mesoderm and neural plate, there are many aspects of neural and mesodermal patterning that remain poorly understood. Current projects include examination of signaling from the neural plate to the mesoderm, screens for molecules that affect anterior-posterior organization of the neural plate, and screens for new molecules involved in mesoderm induction and patterning. </p><p>A crucial aspect of axis formation is the coordinated movement of cells during gastrulation. The development of fluorescent protein fusions to mark cytoskeletal and cell surface changes will allow the functional dissection of this process. We have shown that the coordination of cell movements during convergence and extension of the Xenopus gastrula and during neural tube closure relies on a conserved Wnt signaling pathway, the planar cell polarity pathway. </p><p><i>Mouse development.</i> While Xenopus is extremely useful for embryology, it is not suited to genetic experiments. To complement the Xenopus embryology, we make mutations in mouse homologs of genes that we isolate. Thus we can not only study the activity of genes in Xenopus, but also analyze the requirement for the gene rigorously in the mouse. For example, noggin is expressed in several places in the mouse, and we find that noggin function is required for correct nervous system, somite and skeletal development. Noggin expression and function overlaps with that of other BMP antagonists, and we are in the process of analyzing mutations in other antagonists, individually and in combination with the noggin mutation.</p>'

S"<p>Research projects going on in the group are two-fold. They include the study of the statistical or dynamical basis of chemical reactions in condensed phase on the femtosecond time scale and the dynamics and properties of electrons on surfaces and at interfaces. Femtosecond lasers and ultrahigh vacuum technology provide a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of electrons at metal-dielectric and metal-semiconductor interfaces. The femtosecond two-photon photoemission (TPPE) technique utilizes a femtosecond pump pulse to excite electrons from the metal substrate into states associated with the surface. Photoemission of the surface electrons with a second femtosecond pulse allows one to follow the various surface properties in real time since the photoemission intensity as a function of time delay between the pump and the probe pulse directly reveals the dynamics of the surface electron population. Layer-by-layer growth of dielectrics and large band gap semiconductors on metal surfaces influences the binding energies, lifetimes, and spatial distributions of electrons on surfaces and at interfaces. Studies of Xe overlayers have shown the evolution of metal surface states into quantum well states. Overlayers of n-alkanes result in self-trapping of initially delocalized electrons into localized small polarons. We have studied two dimensional solvation of electrons interacting with nitrile and alcohol overlayers on silver surfaces. Current studies focus on extending our understanding of electronic structure and dynamics to technologically important systems. In general these methods enable us to study the dynamics of electrons interacting with condensed matter in 2-D and how the properties change as the system evolves into 3-D. </p><p>The second area, femtosecond infrared and ultraviolet and visible spectroscopic methods are utilized to investigate the dynamics of complex chemical reactions in solution. The most basic reactions in solution share certain reaction processes, which include dissociation, recombination, solvent caging, molecular morphology changes, and system-solvent interaction. These molecular events, which underlie our basic understanding of reaction dynamics, occur on ultrafast (10-13-10-10 s) timescales. Our research utilizes femtosecond experimental techniques along with modern computational methods to study these fundamental issues. The femtosecond infrared lasers developed in our group enable us to study a variety of chemical systems in both the time and spectral domain and as such we can follow elementary chemical reaction events as they occur. There are also workstations capable of carrying out large-scale, high-level quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Theoretical methods including ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) as well as MD are utilized to assist interpretation and realization of experimental results. The combined experimental and theoretical approach leads to a deeper understanding of these fundamental processes. Not only do the results of these studies address the issues outlined above, but they are also of interest to researchers throughout the many subdisciplines in chemistry including biological, organometallic, inorganic, and organic chemistry. </p><p>In many instances the theoretical basis for the experiments and observations must also be developed. As a result graduate students from Professor Harris's group often obtain their Ph.D. with a strong background in both theory and experiment. </p>"

S'<p>I have been involved in anthropological research concerned with long-termhuman-plant relationships since 1979. Concentrating in archaeology, I have focusedprimarily on long-term plant-human interactions in the South American region,although I have also worked in Turkey. I primarily study highland Andean societies,especially later prehistory with the pre-Inka and the Inka political world. Since1992, I have been directing a project on the shores of Lake Titicaca, Bolivia wherewe investigate early settled life at a series of sites creating a regionalperspective. The research team is  interested in the domestic daily world of theresidents, but also of their ritual and social worlds. The detailed data rich fieldorientation requires us to study closely the discrete details of daily liferegistered in the artifacts. The Taraco Archaeological Projec is investigating aseries of sites that span the Formative periods  1500 BC - AD 300, investigating therise of regional identities. Between 1996 and 2001 I was involved in research at theNeolithic village site of \xc3\x87atal H\xc3\xb6y\xc3\xbck, where I headed the archaeologicalmacro-botanical research. </p><p>My laboratory expertise is what is called either paleoethnobotany orarchaeobotany--the study of plants used by humans in the past. I currently directthe UCB McCown Archaeobotany Laboratory where a series of analytical projects areongoing. Students working with me have a chance to immediately join in on currentlaboratory and field projects. I regularly take on both undergraduates and graduatesin both types of research. While my main work has been with macroremains, we are nowbeginning to include phytolith and starch analysis, in addition to documentinginternal cellular morphology identification. The types of projects I am currentlyinvolved in range from social theory of past human social life, foodways, tomethodology that leads us to a better understanding of past plant use. I havewritten on agricultural production, cooking practices and what shifts in thesesuggest about social relations, gender relations surrounding plant use, the rise ofcomplex society, political change and the symbolic use of plants in the legitimationof authority, fuel use and symbolism, and the origins of plant domestication associal identity. Furthermore, I have written a series of pieces onpaleoethnobotanical methods. I am particularly interested in wild taxa use ascompared to domesticates and the stages in plant processing in terms of other socialrealms, especially symbolic and political, in addition to the playing out of theconcept of culture in a natural world. I am currently writing a book on the thestudy of food ways in the past, in a book titled: Past Repasts, the archaeology offood.</p>'

S'My research lies in the macro side of organizational theory. It can best be summarized as the analysis of how organizations, the fields in which they are embedded, and the careers of their members and employees evolve. I investigate questions that relate to organizational stability and change: How strong are the forces that impel or inhibit change in organizational structures, strategies, and actions? What are the consequences of organizational change for organizations themselves and for their employees? My published studies have investigated California thrifts (1872-1928 and 1960s-1990s), Iowa telephone companies (1900-1917), Manhattan hotels (1898-1990), California hospitals (1978-1991), American magazines (1741-1860), and U.S. electric utilities (1980-1992).

S"I am a cultural anthropologist and I work on the contemporary biosciences in the Americas and the U.K. My work has primarily explored how claims to and about biological material and knowledge help shape contemporary social imaginaries of participation and marginalization. These questions shaped my earlier writings on reproductive technologies, kinship, and lesbian families in the US. They take expanded form in my recent ethnography of bioprospecting in Mexico, When Nature Goes Public, which tracks relationships among 'local' communities, public sector scientists, and drug companies involved in controversial benefit-sharing agreements. I am currently exploring the ethics and practice of clinical trials in Latin America, as well as the rise of an ethic of benefit-sharing in human genetic research. Together, these projects help me think about a number of intertwined concerns. I am interested in critical, ethnographically grounded approaches to intellectual property regimes, ethics, and other modes of governance; in developments in the emergent field of science studies in and of Latin America, and in how ideas of the public are constituted through the biosciences, both North and South."

S"<p>My research focuses on the role of steroid hormones in amphibian development and I conduct both laboratory and field studies in the U.S. and Africa. The two main areas of interest are metamorphosis and sex differentiation, but I am also interested in growth (larval and adult) and hormonal regulation of aggressive behavior. My work addresses problems on several levels including ecological, organismal, and molecular questions. In my work on metamorphosis, I study a local toad (Bufo boreas). Studies examine the effects of temperature on developmental rates, interactions between the thyroid hormones and steroids, and hormonal regulation of skin gland development. I am also examining the effects of tadpole density on developmental rates and measuring metamorphic rates and hormone levels of tadpoles in the field and in the laboratory. My work on sex differentiation involves the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), the Japanese kajika (Buegeria buegeri), and the Pine Barrens treefrog (Hyla femoralis). While Xenopus serves as a good model because of its availability, the latter two species have genetically distinguishable sexes. I can therefore examine early events in gonad differentiation, steroid enzyme activities, steroid receptors, etc., knowing the genetic sex of the individual larvae. </p><p>Currently, I am also examining the effects of exogenous steroids on gonadal differentiation and the potential role of endogenous steroids. My main goal is to synthesize ecological/evolutionary, organismal/physiological, and biochemical/molecular studies to learn how an animal translates changes in its external environment to internal changes, how these internal changes are coordinated, what molecular mechanisms are involved, and in turn, how changes at the molecular level affect an animal's ability to adapt to the changes in its external environment. </p>"

S"<p>Professor Head-Gordon's group performs research on the development and application of electronic structure theories, to permit the treatment ofproblems that are currently beyond the reach of standard methods. The electronic structure problem is to calculate the  properties of a molecule from first principles quantum mechanics, with the objective of obtaining information on structure and reactivity.  Since this information is crucial to understanding and controlling the chemistry of molecules, applications of electronic structure theory play an important and growing role in many areas of chemistry.</p><p>At the same time, there are fundamental problems with the currentstandard electronic structure methods.  Standard theories are notcapable of correctly breaking chemical bonds or describing darkexcited states that control photochemistry, without resorting tospecialist multireference methods.  Standard electronic structuremethods have computational costs that rise as unphysically steep powers of the number of atoms in the molecule.  This makes applicationto large molecules and molecular assemblies unfeasible at present,particularly with the most accurate methods.  Additionally thereis a need to bridge the large gulf that exists betweeen the methodsby which electronic structure calculations are performed and theway in which the physical insight is extracted from the calculations. </p><p>Professor Head-Gordon and his group are performing research thataims to address issues such as those identified above, to buildthe next generation of electronic structure theories.  This researchcombines fundamental quantum mechanics and many-body theory withaspects of applied mathematics and numerical analysis, as well ashigh performance computing.  Exciting progress has been made overthe last few years in linear scaling methods for density functionaltheory, new approaches to describing the correlations betweenelectrons in spatially localized terms, and new model chemistries forground and excited states.  Additionally, challenging chemicalapplications are performed in diverse areas of chemistry to exploitnew theoretical developments, and to further probe the limitationsof standard methods.  These studies are often in collaborationwith experimental studies, and recent examples have been in the areasof combustion and interstellar chemistry. </p>"

S'<p>The research goal of our laboratory is to understand intracellular morphogenesis at a molecular level; in particular the complex events that underlie cell division.  Our major focus is the mitotic spindle, the dynamic microtubule-based machine essential for the correct distribution of chromosomes to each daughter cell.  We would like to understand how the spindle forms and functions, and how its size is determined.  We apply diverse and interdisciplinary techniques, including an in vitro celluar extract system, as well as chemical, proteomic and biophysical approaches.</p><p><b> Current Projects </b></p><p>Developing simplified assays to study spindle assembly.  Utilizing extracts prepared from eggs of the African frog Xenopus laevis and "artificial chromosomes" consisting of plasmid DNA-coated magnetic beads, we can generate bipolar spindles in vitro in the absence of focal microtubule nucleation centers (centrosomes) or specialized microtubule-chromosome attachment sites (kinetochores). DNA on the beads assembles into chromatin that is sufficient to induce microtubule polymerization and organization, but the mechanisms behind this process are unclear.  We are using a molecular reconstitution approach to evaluate the roles of candidate chromatin factors by coupling them to beads individually and in combination, and in the long term, aim to reconstitute the spindle from pure components.</p><p>Elucidating the role of Ran.  In collaboration with the laboratory of Karsten Weis, we are studying one pathway important for spindle assembly that depends on the small GTPase Ran.  Analogous to its role in interphase nucleocytoplasmic transport, RanGTP generated by the chromatin-bound guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 in mitosis functions to locally discharge cargoes from transport factors in the vicinity of chromosomes that promote spindle assembly.  We have used fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) probes to demonstrate a physical gradient of RanGTP and a released cargo surrounding mitotic chromosomes, and are identifying and functionally characterizing the many downstream effectors of this pathway, as well as a small molecule inhibitor we can use to dissect its functions in living cells.</p><p>Mechanisms of intracellular scaling.  We are investigating the question of how cells determine the size of their constituent structures.  We compare Xenopus laevis and the related, smaller frog Xenopus tropicalis, which possesses smaller eggs, spindles and nuclei.  Mixing egg extracts from the two frogs together has revealed a dynamic, dose-dependent regulation of spindle and nuclear size by cytoplasmic factors, which is independent of the amount of DNA.  A variety of assays are being designed to identify the responsible scaling factors, and to test and whether organelle scaling activities are also present in smaller cells of developing embryos.</p><p>Chromosome architecture and cell division. Chromosomes play a critical role in their own transmission, yet the mechanisms determining their higher order organization and mitotic functions are not understood. We are evaluating the roles of several factors including condensin, cohesin, and histone H1 in chromosome condensation and segregation, using microscopy and biophysical approaches.</p>'

S"<p>Professor Heathcock is fascinated with organic reactions, understanding their intimate personalities, and applying them for the construction of intricate structures. He and his students and postdoctoral coworkers engage in 'multistep synthesis.' The synthetic goals are complex, polycyclic natural products, often possessing unusual biological activity. However, the purpose of the research is not just to prepare compounds for biological or pharmacological testing, but rather to learn something new about the creative process of synthesis design. For this reason, the synthetic targets are chosen because it is thought that their novel structures are likely to lead the experimentalist to unusual chemistry. The goal is to use sound mechanistic reasoning to invent multistep syntheses that are sufficiently non-obvious that they will serve as object lessons for other scientists, and thereby contribute to a general elevation of the level of sophistication of the science of large-molecule synthesis.</p>"

S'<p>I am interested in the diffuse interstellar medium. Itsmorphology and dynamics are dominated by supernova explosions, which tend to cluster and form huge bubbles in the interstellar gas. The nearest of these is the Eridanus superbubble, which was formed by the explosions of previous generations of Orion cluster stars. I am currently embarked on a very detailed and comprehensive study of this superbubble---the X-ray emission from the hot interior gas, the H-alpha and 21-cm line emission from the cold gas in the surrounding shell, and the molecular line emission from the denser portions of this shell.</p><p> One of the dominant forces on the interstellar gas is magnetic. Interstellar magnetic fields arenotoriously difficult to observe. The new Arecibo and Green Bank telescope are opening up many important opportunities using Zeeman splitting of the 21-cm line; I am a major, user of Arecibo and will be of the GBT, which will begin operations during the next year. At Arecibo, I have embarked on a large project to Measure magnetic fields in cold atomic clouds, ongoing over the next year or two. At this point, early in the project, we have two surprising results: one, magnetic field strengths in cold dense gas are much weaker than we had thought; two, a by-product of these measurements is accurate kinetic temperatures for the gas, and these are much different from previous results---with some significant departures from the established theoretical paradigm.</p><p> Zeeman splitting is revealed by exceedingly weak polarization in the spectral lines. In the past few years I have developed the technique of crosscorrelation single-dish spectropolarimetry so that this is now the most accurate and versatile method. Along the way I have become very interested in characterizing the details of the telescope response pattern, because these can produce systematic effects that affect the accuracy of Zeeman splitting measurements. In dealing with the new telescopes, this aspect has become an increasingly interesting and important part of the measurement process.</p>'

S'<p>My research group is concerned with the properties of novel magnetic, semiconducting, and superconducting materials especially in thin film form. We use specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and other measurements as a function of temperature in order to test and develop models for materials which challenge our understanding of metallic behavior. <br /><br /><br /><br />Current research includes: effects of spin on transport and tunneling, including studies of amorphous magnetic semiconductors and spin injection from ferromagnets into Si; finite size effects on magnetic and thermodynamic properties; formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in magnetic thin films and effects of the vapor-deposition growth process on the structure of thin film amorphous and crystalline materials. <br /><br /><br /><br />We also have an extensive effort in development of calorimetry for thin films, small bulk samples, and nano-scale biological systems. We use Si-microfabrication techniques to create membrane-based micro/nanocalorimeters that allow us to measure films weighing micrograms or less from 1-500K and in magnetic fields at present to 8T. We are working with researchers at the national high magnetic field lab to extend the magnetic field range to 45T in steady state and 100T in pulsed fields, and the temperature range to 0.3K.</p>'

Her current interests are personality processes in life-span context, such as how enduring affective-cognitive styles are associated with life choices, roles, stresses, and satisfactions; how identity processes shape work lives and retirement; changes in the self; and the development of wisdom. Long interested in gender issues, Dr. Helson now works with students on data from the Mills Study, which has followed some 120 women for 40 years, from ages 21 to 61. The Mills Study examines long-term personality components (e.g., attachment, traits), social influences on personality (e.g., work and family roles, social networks, the women's movement, the culture of individualism), and processes of growth and development (e.g., how early marriage affects identity consolidation).</p>"

S'<p>I am an historian whose research is focused on those segments of ancient society that are poorly represented in the elite literature that is the foundation of the discipline of Classical Studies. I am able to pursue this interest because of my training in papyrology, a subspecialty that is devoted to the decipherment and interpretation of papyrus manuscripts, the \xe2\x80\x9ceveryday\xe2\x80\x9d writing of the inhabitants of Egypt (and other regions, though Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s preservative sands have yielded the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of our texts). Only a handful of scholars have this training (perhaps 200 worldwide), and few of them have positions in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>My research to date has centered on two issues. The first is the question of economic decision making. I have been interested in elucidating the choices that ancient people of various statuses made and the factors (for example, risk tolerance, the environment, access to information, custom) that contributed to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s calculus. My first book addressed this topic in some detail for a large agricultural estate, arguing strongly against recent readings of the evidence in which such entities were claimed to have been rationally managed with the aim of maximizing profit. (The works in question give insufficient emphasis to the sociocultural context of economic transactions.) More lately, my attention has been devoted to the impact of \xe2\x80\x9cr\xc3\xa9gime change\xe2\x80\x9d on Egyptian society; that is, I have been wondering how the coming of the Romans affected certain groups, in particular the Egyptian priesthood. Again, my research bucks the communis opinio: Rather than suggesting resistance (in the traditional sense of that word), that the priests were the principal opponents of external power and served as guardians of indigenous tradition, I demonstrate that their engagement with the dominant culture was quite significant, and call for a nuanced interpretation informed by theoretical literature on the modern colonial experience.</p>'

Theoretical, constructional, evolutionary, and develop-mental morphology provide the conceptual and practical tools that I use to analyze structure and function. Molluscs are the primary subject organisms for defining principles of structure. I have developed new model systems: the gastropod radula, suspension feeding devices, and the gastropod larval shell, as well as novel tools that include design spaces, ecospaces, ethospaces, and developmental spaces in which phylogenetic trajectories illustrate macroevolutionary trends and patterns. </p><p>As paleobiologist and geologist, I am investigating the taphonomic assembly and patterning of shell beds in the fossil record and the responses of community architecture to global climate change during the Cenozoic Era. Recently completed projects include an astrobiological theory of the role of microbial-metazoan interactions in extreme environments, an analysis of the "problem of similarity," and an analysis of changes in shell biomineralization at metamorphosis that are reflected in funeous composite bioinorganic materials. Students in my laboratory develop their own research questions and systems. We share a common passion for evolutionary history and structure that includes the use of molecular tools. </p>'

S"<p>Stephen P. Hinshaw's main interests lie in the fields of clinical child and adolescent psychology and developmental psychopathology. Major themes of his work include the diagnostic validity of childhood disorders, the role of peer relationships in normal and atypical development (particularly ADHD), the utility of identifying subcategories of aggressive behavior, the early prediction of behavioral and learning problems, the neuropsychology and neurobiology of impulsive and externalizing behavior in childhood, the contribution of family factors to acting out and antisocial behavior, and the implementation of combinations of psychosocial and pharmacologic intervention for children with externalizing behavior disorders. He is particularly interested in the use of clinical intervention studies to provide information on developmental mechanisms of change regarding psychopathology and resilience.  </p><p>Increasingly, his research interests are focusing on adolescent and young adult outcomes, as children in his various projects continue to participate in prospective, longitudinal studies. </p><p>Several of these themes combine in Hinshaw's investigations of children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In intensive summer research programs, previously unfamiliar youngsters--some with diagnoses of ADHD; some comparison children without clinical-range behavioral problems--come together to participate in classroom, playground, and small-group activities that simulate natural environments. Observations of ongoing behavior allow investigations of the interrelationships among social behavior, peer reputation, moral reasoning, parenting style, and diagnostic status (including aggressive vs. nonaggressive ADHD children). In addition, the response of youngsters with ADHD to stimulant medication is investigated. Three years of summer camps for girls with ADHD have been completed following many years of boys' programs, with all participants in ongoing follow-up. The girls\xe2\x80\x99 sample constitutes the largest preadolescent sample of girls with ADHD in existence worldwide.</p><p>Another major project involves a multi-site, long-term clinical trial of medication and psychosocial interactions for children with ADHD (MTA Study). Along with NIMH and five other research centers, Berkeley is conducting treatment process and outcome research in an intensive experimental investigation, with Hinshaw serving as Principal Investigator for the Berkeley site. Predictors, moderators, and mediators of treatment outcome are featured in this research, which comprises the largest scale project of its kind in the field. Prospective follow-up investigations are now underway.</p><p>Recent conceptual and empirical work is focused on the conceptual underpinnings of definitions of mental disorders and the stigma that pertains to persons with mental illness.</p><p>Finally, he is collaborating with Public Health investigators on national and worldwide patterns of prescription and usage of psychostimulant medications. Current NIMH grant support focuses on (a) follow-up of the girls\xe2\x80\x99 sample, (b) follow-up of the MTA sample, (c) functional neuroimaging of children with ADHD as well as their parents, and (d) economics and diffusion of psychoactive medication patterns for children. </p><p>Students who work with Dr. Hinshaw learn extensively about the assessment of childhood behavioral disorders; the implementation of cognitive-behavioral treatment procedures for children, including the use of parent management training for families; and the theoretical linkages among cognitive, linguistic, behavioral, and peer-related systems in normal and atypical development. Both experimental and longitudinal research design skills are emphasized, with particular focus on data analytic tools. Students are encouraged to receive broad training in child and adult psychopathology, psychological evaluation, multivariate statistics, developmental psychology, and psychopharmacology.</p>"

S'<p>My research interests concern religious practice, media technologies, and emergent forms of political community in the Middle East and North America. Taking contemporary developments within the traditions of Islam as my primary focus, I have explored how various religious practices and institutions have been revised and renewed both by modern norms of social and political life, and by the styles of consumption and culture linked to global mass media practices. In approaching these issues, I have been particularly interested in the cultural organization of sensory experience, including the practices of language, media and gesture through which traditions of sensory knowledge and skill have been sustained and developed. I explore a number of these themes in a book I am currently completing, entitled The Ethics of Listening:Affect, Media, and the Islamic Counterpublic. Most recently, I have shifted my focus to Europe, in a project that examines how Spain\'s Islamic legacy is inflecting the way the "Muslim Problem"--a pivotal issue in contemporary discourses of European identity--is being posed within Spanish national debates.</p>'

S'<p>Dr. Holmes is a cultural and medical anthropologist and physician whose  work focuses broadly on social hierarchies, health disparities, and the  ways in which perceptions of social difference naturalize and normalize  these inequalities.  Dr. Holmes is currently investigating social  hierarchies and health disparities in the context of US-Mexico migration  as well as the ways in which these inequalities become understood to be  natural and normal. This project draws on approximately eighteen months  of full-time participant-observation, during which time Dr. Holmes  migrated with undocumented indigenous Mexicans in the United States and  Mexico, picked berries in Washington State, pruned vineyards in central  California, harvested corn in the mountains of Oaxaca, accompanied  migrant laborers on clinic visits, and trekked across the border desert  into Arizona. Concurrently, he is conducting research into the processes  through which medical professionals learn to perceive and respond to  social difference. In addition, Dr. Holmes is exploring new mixed  qualitative and quantitative research into the social, cultural, and  political processes producing high HIV death rates among specific groups  of people, notably homeless people, ethnoracial and sexual minorities,  and immigrants. This new project addresses the ways in which macro  political economic structures and social categories affect individual  behavior and vulnerability.</p>'

Since such regimes to not generate themselves but are promoted, transmitted, and maintained by 'intellectuals' who move in specific historical spaces and times, my research also focuses on the concept of the 'materiality' of intellectuals. In addition, I have examined the extent to which European intellectuals had developed a 'global democratic consciousness' before the advent of globalization, as well as the presence of a 'jurisprudence of conscience' in national and international jurisprudence. I have been inspired by Gramsci's theory of intellectuals and by feminist theory. Through fieldwork in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as in Muslim majority countries, I have been able to compare predominant epistemological of the transatlantic worlds with innovative epistemological points of view and global critical theories which have emerged from outside Europe and North America over the past fifteen years.

S"<p>My primary research interests are in the measurement and interpretation of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Primary anisotropies of the CMB provide a probe of the universe at the time when the CMB photons last interacted with the matter. Measurements of CMB anisotropies place strong constraints on cosmological models. Within the context of a given model, high sensitivity measurements of the power spectrum of the CMB can be used to precisely determine cosmological parameters such as the density of energy and baryonic matter in the Universe. Hot electrons bound to clusters of galaxies Compton scatter the photons of the CMB. The resulting distortion of the incident blackbody spectrum in the direction of a cluster of galaxies \xe2\x80&#147; the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) Effect - can be used as a sensitive probe of cosmology and cluster physics. Combining measurements of the SZ effect with X-ray observations provides a unique and physically based determination of the distance scale of the Universe and cluster baryon fraction. In addition, source counts of distant SZ clusters probe the growth of structure and provide constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy which is believed to dominate the dynamics of the Universe. Due to advances in the detector technology and observation strategy, the sensitivity of CMB anisotropy experiments is rapidly increasing. My group is actively involved in the design, construction and operation of several new CMB anisotropy projects as well as the development of cryogenics, electronics, optics, and detectors to enable future advances in this rapidly maturing field. </p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>ACBAR: The Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR) is a 16 element, 230 mK, bolometer array designed to observe CMB anisotropies at 4 mm-wavelength frequencies with 4 arcminute resolution. With its high spatial resolution and broad frequency coverage, ACBAR provides an essential compliment to present and future balloon borne and orbital CMB missions. The receiver was deployed on the 2m VIPER telescope at the South Pole in December 2000 and is currently engaged in its fourth and final of observations. ACBAR has mapped several hundred square degrees of sky with unprecedented sensitivity. These maps have been used to produce the highest signal to noise measurement of the CMB power spectrum on fine angular scales.</p><p>BICEP: BICEP (Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) is an experiment designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to unprecedented precision.  For large values of the tensor to scalar ratio, BICEP has the potential to detect the polarization signature due to the inflationary gravitational wave background and determine the energy scale of inflation. More realistically, BICEP will perform a pioneering study of observations, analysis, and foreground removal necessary for detailed characterization of CMB polarization. The instrument operates at 100 GHz and 150 GHz achieving angular resolutions of 1.0\xc2\xb0 and 0.7\xc2\xb0, respectively, with an array of 96 polarization-sensitive detectors. BICEP will be deployed to South Pole in December 2005, where it will begin its program to map a large region of the sky around the South Celestial Pole.</p><p>APEX: The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) is a 12-meter telescope at an elevation of 16,500 ft in the Chilean Andes. The telescope is a prototype for the ALMA array and was built by a European collaboration headed the Max Planck Institute.  We are building a 300-element bolometer array receiver for use on this telescope. When placed on the APEX telescope, this receiver will be used to carry out a pioneering survey of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to distant clusters of galaxies. The first observations with APEZ will begin in November 2005.</p><p>SPT: We are also working on an ambitious project to field a 1000 element array of background limited TES sensors on a dedicated 10-meter off axis telescope at the South Pole. The large number of detectors and dedicated telescope will allow us to carry out a definitive survey of distant SZ galaxy clusters in the Southern hemisphere. The South Pole telescope is scheduled to begin observation in December 2006.</p>"

S'<p>My research interests are focused on string theory, as a leading candidate for the quantum theory of gravity and unification. In recent years, string theory has been going through a revolutionary period, whose results changed our understanding of the theory and created new paradigms in other fields, ranging from pure mathematics, to quantum field theory, to particle phonomenology and cosmology. </p><p>As a result of this "string revolution" we now understand that string theory is a unique theory: all the apparently distinct string theories are manifestations of a single structure, related to each other by a web of new quantum symmetries known as dualities. These dualities also relate string theory to a new theory without strings, known as M-theory, whose structure remains somewhat mysterious. </p><p>String theory represents a systematic modification of general theory of relativity, so that it is compatible with quantum mechanics. Therefore, we can address some of the long-standing puzzles of quantum gravity in the string theoretical framework, such as the statistical interpretation of the thermodynamic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes. In a class of stringy black holes amenable to analysis, the entropy has been explained as counting of stringy states. This result further confirms that string theory is indeed on the right track to describe the microscopic physics of quantum gravity, as the correct degrees of freedom have already been identified. </p><p>The question of correct degrees of freedom for quantum gravity is related to the "holographic principle," according to which the number of degrees of freedom of any quantum gravitational system should scale as the area of the surface surrounding the system. Thus, it should be possible to completely describe the system by a finite density of states on a "holographic screen." We have indications that string theory is indeed holographic, although this fact is far from manifest -- holography is a "secret" property of string theory. </p><p>Even though string and M-theory may be a unique structure, in order to compare its predictions to the real world we are facing the difficult task of solving the theory in the regime with no apparent space-time supersymmetry. This vacuum selection problem is closely tied to the most fundamental naturalness problem of modern physics: why is the cosmological constant so small, in the apparent absence of supersymmetry? This problem is again related to the identification of the correct degrees of freedom in quantum gravity, and therefore closely connected to holography. </p><p>In my research, I will continue exploring the theoretical structure of string theory, trying to clarify its underlying principles and implications for related areas of physics. Among the particularly fascinating open problems that are currently being addressed is the structure of non-supersymmetric excitations in string theory; however, my personal favorite is the question of how string theory modifies cosmology. After all, our current concepts of the universe are based on classical general relativity, and string theory is a substantial step beyond that -- it should be expected to revolutionize cosmology, once we learn how to study cosmological solutions of string theory and M-theory. </p><p>The current status of string theory is very reminiscent of the situation in theoretical physics in the early 20th century, when the basic concepts of quantum mechanics were being developed, profoundly influencing the way we think about physical systems. String theory has already started changing the way we think about the structure of space-time, and can certainly be expected to continue to do so in the near future.</p>'

S'<p>My research and teaching has been focused on political economy of development in East Asia, especially China. I am interested in the question of local-global articulation in the process of international economic restructuring. My book (1998) analyzed the cultural and institutional configuration in the processes of Taiwanese direct investment in southern China over the past two decades. More recently I have extended this work in two related directions. Locally, I examine the politics of growth in Chinesecities and towns and its implication on socialist transition and the development discourse. My second book, temporarily entitled "Landed Politics in China\'s Small Towns," will discuss local politics around land development in the post-Mao era. Globally, I explore the making of transnational Chinese business networks and its implication on ethnic identities and regional boundaries. I rely heavily on fieldwork for data collection, and I find in-depth interviews and participatory observation indispensable and inspiring. What\'s equally fun is the historical exploration of these issues. I am often surprised by the past, as one would expect from speculating on the future. For me, Geography is as much about space as about time.</p>'

S"<p>My research interests concern the development and application ofstatistical/mathematical methods for problems associated with variousbiological systems and data. Recent projects include: 1). Regulatorysequence analysis. We present a p-value based scoring scheme usingprobability generating functions to evaluate the potential transcriptionfactor binding sites (TFBSs). We introduce the local genomic context intothe model so that candidate sites are evaluated based both on theirsimilarities to known binding sites and on their contrasts against theirrespective local genomic contexts. We demonstrate that our approach isadvantageous in the prediction of myogenin and MEF2 binding sites in thehuman genome. This method has been packaged for use (available uponrequest). High eukaryotic genomes present a particular challenge to thecomputational identification of TFBSs because of their long non-codingregions and large numbers of repeat elements. I am very attracted to theproblems associated with binding sites/motifs discovery in high-levelorganisms. An ongoing project is to describe the target binding motifsusing the evolutionary information of associated species under atree-based model. We expect that the new derived motifs would help betterunderstand the evolutionary development of the binding sites. 2). Analysisof large-scale expression data. With Li Cai (Dana Farber Cancer Institute)and others, we work on SAGE data and develop a clustering algorithm togroup tags sharing similar count patterns under different conditions. Thisalgorithm is designed based on the nature of the SAGE data, and evidencedto be advantageous in analyzing the developing and mature mouse retinadata (Cepko's lab, Harvard Medical School). An Ongoing project is todevelop methods for accurately estimating gene correlations acrossmultiple dependent arrays. The developed methods will be applied to a setof cross-platform microarray datasets for identifying regulators oftranscription modules (collaborating with Zhou's lab at USC). 3).Mathematical/statistical theories: I am also interested in studying themathematical/statistical theories underlying those computational methods.</p>"

These efforts are conducted by a combination of  field data analysis, development of mechanistic models, and verification  of those models at the laboratory scale. Environmental data analysis is  directed mainly at water resources systems, largely driven by  watershed-scale systems where water resources are limited and impacted  by local human-induced changes and anticipated climate change.  Contaminants of interest include trace metals, persistent organics,  radionuclides, pathogenic organisms, and poorly characterized wastes  from new industries. The research program seeks to understand the  dominant processes that control contaminant mobility in natural and  altered environments.</p>"

S'<p>Whether the topic is Inner Mongolian herders or California ranchers, extensive livestock production on rangelands requires negotiation between demand for a relatively predictable flow of products and the inherent unpredictability of an arid rangeland environment. There are property and social relations, practices, and values that are widespread among pastoralists and ranchers that reflect adaptation to the disequilibrium dynamics of the resource base upon which they depend. My work seeks to understand these factors as part of socio-ecological systems, with the goal of learning how long-term, sustainable management of rangelands can be created, and of contributing to the growing body of literature and theory surrounding the concept of socio-ecological systems. This concept is not uncontroversial, but I find it appealing as rangeland ecologist and manager who must look at social relations in order to understand the structure and function of agro-ecosystems like rangelands used for livestock production.</p>'

S'<p>The work in the lab is focused on ion channels and other signaling proteins, and their role in neural excitability, synaptic transmission, and the molecular and functional development of the synapse.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Structure and protein motions of voltage and ligand gated channels.</i> We have developed new methods for studying ion channel structure and protein motion. We label channel proteins on the surface of living cells in a site-directed manner with fluorescent dyes. We detect local protein motion via changes in the microenvironment of the dye in real-time, with sub-millisecond resolution, by measuring fluorescence intensity, wavelength and dye mobility. These optical reports identify "what moves when" in relation to functional events that are synchronized for the channel population and measured with a voltage clamp. In addition to obtaining kinetic maps of protein motion, we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer as a spectroscopic ruler to make structural determinations. This method enables us to view movements of individual segments of the channel protein, in individual subunits, so that the spatial location and role in gating of each domain of the protein can be determined. From measurements of movement and distance we are working to assemble an animated structural model of the conformational rearrangements that activate, open, close and inactivate channels. In addition, we are now beginning to make optical measurements of protein motion on the single channel level. Our work, which began with a voltage-gated K+ channel, is now expanding to other classes of channels that are activated by very different classes of signals, such as ligand binding. Our aim is to discover general principles that enable different kinds of signal transduction apparatus to control the conformation of molecular gates that control ion flux and ion selectivity. </p><p><i>Development of genetically encoded optical sensors of cell signaling.</i> Measuring electrical activity in large numbers of cells with high spatial and temporal resolution is a fundamental problem for the study of neural signaling. To address this problem, we have constructed a novel, genetically-encoded probe that can be used to measure transmembrane voltage in single cells. We fused a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the voltage-sensitive Shaker channel, creating a channel whose voltage-dependent rearrangements induce large changes in the fluorescence of GFP. A genetically manipulable voltage sensor has the advantage that its operating range can be tuned by mutagenesis, and that it may be introduced into an organism and targeted for expression to specific developmental stages, brain regions, cell types, and sub-cellular locations. We are using similar strategies to develop different optical sensors by fusing this GFP to other detector proteins such as channels and receptors. Such sensors can be used to ask specific biological questions about the native role of the detector proteins, or, instead, to report on the signals that activate these proteins. We are using such sensors to determine the role of signaling pathways in Drosophila synapse formation and in several other model synaptic systems.</p>'

S"<p>Our research focuses on the cognitive neuroscience of action and skilledmovement. We conduct experiments involving neurologically healthy and impairedindividuals, using a range of methods to develop psychological models of how peopleproduce and learn movements. We use neuroscientific methods to develop these modelsand characterize the functional role of different parts of the motor pathways.Current techniques include study of neurological patients including patients withParkinson's disease, focal lesions of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, andsplit-brain patients, functional MRI, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. We alsohave a virtual reality system to study movements in artificial worlds.  </p><p>A primary area of study is the relationship of cognition and action.   There aremany factors that determine why some individuals are coordinated and others are not. Some of these factors may be related to individual differences in biomechanicalfactors.  On the other hand, many relate to differences that arise at more abstractlevels of processing associated with action planning.   Our work is designed tounderstand these various factors by studying brain function in healthy individualsand people with damage to different parts of the nervous system.</p><p>Another primary area of research involves the study of motor control and motorlearning. We have conducted behavioral and neuroimaging studies comparing explicitand implicit motor sequence learning. This work suggests separable psychological andneural systems associated with these two forms of motor learning. Our current workis designed to clarify differences between the systems in terms of how theyrepresent learned associations.   We are now extending these ideas to other types ofmotor learning, focusing on how the principles that operate in learning skilledmovements is similar and different to non-motor forms of learning. </p><p>I am also interested in how responses are selected. One critical issue here iswhether there is a central control system that evaluates all possible responses andchooses the one that is most appropriate given the current context. Or, theselection process may be a more distributed process involving local competitionsbetween alternative actions. Our research on this problem involves behavioral andneuroimaging studies with healthy individuals, as well as neuropsychological studieswith various groups including split-brain patients. This latter group allows us toobserve response selection when the major pathway between the two hemispheres hasbeen severed.</p>"

S'<p>Our goal is to understand how cognition evolves. To do this, we study spatial cognition, a critical cognitive trait: all mobile animals must track resources, such as mates, food and competitors, in time and space. Using a Cog-Evo-Devo framework, we both compare cognition across species and identify differences within species, such as sex and developmental differences. Understanding spatial cognition addresses not only how brains encode a representation of the physical world but also suggests how such representations are exadapted into more complex thought processes, such as reasoning and language.</p><p>To understand spatial orientation, we have developed a theoretical framework, the parallel map theory, derived from an analysis of the evolution of hippocampal function (Jacobs &amp; Schenk, 2003). Here we have proposed that the mammalian hippocampus creates dual, parallel spatial representations that are anatomically and functionally dissociable. Because of map independence, spatial orientation can be rescued when one map is impaired. This model also provides the neural basis for the classical map and compass theory of spatial orientation in vertebrates and a unified theory to understand species, sex and developmental changes in spatial orientation. Recently, we have used PMT to direct our research on cognitive sex differences, finding similar patterns in frame of reference and cue use across rodent species and humans. Recasting sex differences as the preferential use of parallel maps is a powerful tool for analyzing the cognitive and neural mechanisms of spatial orientation in mammals.</p><p><b> Current Research </b></p><p>We compare species that have recently diverged and also species who are solving the same problem with convergent mechanisms. In the past we have studied gray, fox and flying tree squirrels, voles and kangaroo rats, in the field as well as the lab, and have recently moved into comparative studies of domesticated species, such as laboratory mice, Mongolian gerbils and pet dogs, humans and robots.   Our current work focuses on the flexible use of spatial strategies in captive gerbils and free-ranging fox squirrels and humans, including young children.  These studies form an empirical foundation for our NSF-funded collaboration on navigation and spatial problem solving in robots. We are also interested in flexible strategies in cache economics: how a scatter hoarding species, such as a fox squirrel creates, monitors and exploits its massive external food store, and we have ongoing studies of foraging decisions in wild fox squirrels. Finally, we are also interested in flexible social strategies, specifically the transfer of information within a social network, and are studying this question in two arenas, within human friendship networks and in owner-pet dog networks.</p>'

In the past 10 years the \xe2\x80\x9cStandard Model\xe2\x80\x9d of high energy physics has begun to yield precise predictions of various quantities. Experimental tests of these predictions are both the way to stress test the theory, hopefully to destruction, and to learn more about the remaining unknown parameters.</p><p>The LEP collider and detectors at CERN were until recently the best place to do these experiments. At LEP, it was possible to measure the mass and width of the neutral Z boson to a few parts in 105, allowing us to confront Standard Model expectations and predict the mass of the top quark with better precision than later measurements at Fermilab. To do this, many experimental problems needed to be addressed. In particular, the performance of an accelerator more than 27 kilometers in circumference had to be understood at a very detailed level, including measuring such subtle effects as the energy change due to tides and magnetic fields from trains passing miles away. Although this effort is now winding down, its a good illustration of a general principle: Doing careful precision experiments will lead you through all sorts of interesting questions before you get to the best possible accuracy on your result.</p><p>One part of the Standard Model associated with particle masses and coupling is the \xe2\x80\x9cCKM matrix,\xe2\x80\x9d which relates different types of quarks. Precision measurement of the more inaccessible elements of this matrix is the goal of the BaBar experiment constructed by Berkeley and other institutions and now in operation at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). We are working to measure and understand the parameters that control the \xe2\x80\x9cCP violation\xe2\x80\x9d phenomena, related to the basic differences between matter and antimatter. This is a long-term program, which will produce its most important results around the middle of this decade. It will involve many problems in interesting areas of detector technology, accelerator physics, and theoretical physics, plus areas not yet anticipated. The final accuracy that will be achieved is not yet clear, but it is clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of progress on the horizon.</p><p><b>Current projects</b></p><p>The BaBar detector started taking data in the summer of 1999. Since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve accumulated the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest and best measured sample of B meson decays, along with a large samples of charmed mesons, tau leptons and every other low-mass particle. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been concentrating on understanding and improving the operation and capabilities of both the BaBar detector and the PEP-II collider so we can get as much physics as possible from our data. Based on that work, we are now starting to address some of the important physics questions. For the next few years, effort will be focused on initial measurements of CP violation in the B system. These will form the basis of the precision physics program that is our eventual goal.</p>'

Much of theirwork is based on experiments with the laser-heated diamond cell, but they alsocollaborate in shock-wave experiments and in quantum mechanical calculations ofmaterial properties.</p><p>The group uses mineral physics to understand the properties and dynamics ofplanetary interiors, and has focused on solid-state amorphization, hard materialsand correlated-electron systems in the area of materials physics.  They helpedobtain the first experimental constraints on the temperature at the center of theEarth, and showed that a single perovskite-structured mineral (stable only atpressures above 20 GPa = 0.2 Megabar) makes up the bulk of the mantle.  They havealso shown that the crystalline oxides of the deep mantle react chemically with theliquid iron alloy of the outer core, thus making the core-mantle boundary one of themost dynamic regions of the Earth.  Experiments applying laser-shock methods tosamples pre-compressed in diamond-anvil cells are providing new information onchemical bonding at deep-planetary conditions, and can extend the range oflaboratory compression experiments from the Megabar to the Gigabar regime.</p><p>Raymond Jeanloz also works in technical aspects of public policy, including resourceand environmental issues, national and international security, and scienceeducation.</p>'

I am also investigating statistical tools for community trials for HIV prevention in Africa. Other interests include topics in causal inference and clinical trials, and statistical analyses of adverse health effects associated with therapeutic drugs including Vioxx and Avandia. From a statistical perspective, many of these problems concern survival analysis methods and other techniques for the analysis of incomplete data.

S'Linda Jewell joined the faculty in 1991 after fifteen years of combining an active professional practice with academic appointments, including 4-1/2 years as Chair of Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Landscape Architecture. Professor Jewell is a committed educator who has always kept a hand in practice. Her publications and design work have won numerous ASLA merit and honor awards, including the prestigious Presidential Award in Communications for her 10 years of Construction articles in Landscape Architecture magazine.  Her Berkeley firm, Freeman &amp; Jewell, recently completed a proposal for the Southeast Asian Cloud Forest Garden at the San Francisco Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park., ,  The focus of her scholarship is in three areas: 1) the artistic role of landscape details in landscape design; 2) the relationship of landscapes and structures; and 3) the interplay of drawings and on-site design decisions in the design of landscapes. Her investigations of these topics frequently include a historical perspective. She has published more than 30 articles on landscape construction and design. She also has produced several exhibitions, including a traveling exhibition on American outdoor theaters that she is developing into a book. She recently completed a research project on the role of on-site design decisions by National Park Service designers in the 1930s Civilian Conservation Corps projects. Professor Jewell is also a member of the Master of Urban Design faculty and teaches design studios, courses on sustainable construction materials, construction techniques, and seminars on the analysis of designed landscapes.'

S'George Orwell wrote that Shakespeare had a "love for the surface of the Earth andthe process of life." I can think of no better description of a geographer. Nor canI think of a better place to see the process of life than in cities. Byconcentrating so many people and so much activity into relatively small areas,cities supply great variety to that process and quicken its pace. Cities also give adistinctive shape to the surface of the Earth. They create beauty with a row ofgraceful buildings, a tree-lined avenue, the sophistication of people on downtownstreets. They express great financial and productive power in skyscrapers, freeways,factories, and bridges. They concentrate some of the most squalid and cruel of humanaffairs. Every city, moreover, has shaped places far from it. In some cases it islittle more than a city making a hinterland to supply itself with goods, in othersit is a city imposing its ideas, commodities, and even military power on distantparts of the globe. I have written about Buenos Aires and Mexico City at the turn ofthe nineteenth century, and about American cities in the nineteen-fifties. Throughthose places I have tried to express my own passion for seeing how the surface ofthe Earth and the process of life come together.'

S'My work focuses on understanding the predictors of depression and mania withinbipolar disorder.  We have found strong parallels between the triggers andphenomenology of unipolar and bipolar depression.  We also have found that bipolar disorder is related to elevations in reward sensitivity, or the tendency to beoverly reactive to rewards.  Reward sensitivity predicts increases in mania, as do life events involving reward.  We conduct studies to understand the neural and cognitive underpinnings of reward in bipolar disorder, and we are drawing on those findings to develop a psychological intervention that will supplement medications as a way to prevent manic symptoms.'

S"<p>I am internationally recognized as a specialist in sex and gender in the  past, basing my analyses on art, burials, and the remains of  households. My most recent book, <i>Ancient Bodies, Ancient Lives</i> (Thames  and Hudson 2008), presents the results of global research on sex and  gender by archaeologists for interdisciplinary scholars.  As an anthropological archaeologist, I have conducted field research  in Honduras for more than 30 years. I have excavated some of the  earliest villages in Central America, dating to 1500-500 BC; the largest  settlement in the region, dating 500-1000 AD; and most recently, an  18th century Spanish fort on the Caribbean coast. My research on early  villages resulted in the identification of traces of cacao (the plant  yielding chocolate) dating to at least 1100 BC.  An important part of my work has been the exploration of the ethics  and political contexts of archaeological research. This includes ongoing  work assessing the impacts on cultural heritage policy of the 2009 coup  d'etat in Honduras. Part of this research involves the creation of new  museums and interpretive centers in Honduras.  My work in cultural heritage is in part based in my history as a  museum anthropologist, a field in which I teach at Berkeley. I was  Assistant Director of the Peabody Museum at Harvard University  (1986-1989), and Director of the Hearst Museum of Anthropology here at  Berkeley (1994-1999). I have published essays on contradictions in the  definition of world heritage sites and the way archaeologists evaluate  the significance of archaeological sites; on the role of nationalism in  archaeology; and the way expertise is mobilized in international  consulting. I am currently conducting research in European museums on  early collecting and histories of archaeology.</p>"

S"<p>Our goal is to understand how gene expression is controlled in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, we focus on the transcription elongation process. Regulation during elongation is involved in controlling the expression of a large number of genes, including protooncogenes and several infectious viruses. To understand this regulation, we are studying the molecular details of the transcribing complex during elongation as well as the biological effects brought about by regulated changes in this part of the transcription machinery.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>How does the cell regulate the synthesis of messenger RNA during transcript elongation? RNA polymerase II transcription units can be many thousands of nucleotides long, and efficient expression of such a gene's information requires the efficient elongation of the polymerase along these sequences. A variety of cellular and viral genes contain sequences within the transcription unit that are regulatory hotspots during transcription elongation. These genes include several cellular protooncogenes as well as the human immunodeficiency viruses. Transcription stops at these hotspots under specific cellular conditions, and efficient readthrough of these sites is necessary for production of the gene product. The cell modulates the recognition of these sites in ways that are not yet understood. To define the molecular mechanisms responsible for this regulation, we are using microarray genomic analysis to identify the cadre of gene expression changes that result from mutation or deletion of a variety of elongation factors in yeast. We then are using biochemistry to test the elongation regulation that influences those genes. </p><p>How do accessory elongation factors change the transcript elongation properties of RNA polymerase II? We have shown that a protein (TFIIS) known to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II can act upon purified RNA polymerase II. The yeast and human proteins have been studied using mutagenesis, coupled with in vivo and in vitro analysis, to identify interactions with other proteins as well as structure: function relationships. Genetic screens in yeast deleted for the gene encoding this protein have identified other genes associated with chromatin structure and other open reading frames whose involvement in elongation regulation is being analyzed. Biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology approaches are being used in this work. Also, Microarray analyses are being used to evaluate global effects on RNA synthesis. </p><p>Using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we are also studying the function of subunits of RNA polymerase II during the elongation process, and the effect of post-translational modifications to thepolymerase that control elongation. Specifically, we are dissecting the function of reversible phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II itself in regulating gene expression. We have identified a phosphatase specific for RNA polymerase II and a cofactor essential for its activity in vitro. Structure: function analyses with the phosphatase as well as a variety of in vivo analyses are directed to understanding the role of phosphorylation. </p><p><i>What role does the cellular nucleoprotein play in controlling the elongation and termination reactions of RNA polymerase II?</i> In the cell, the template is not purified DNA but rather is associated with proteins involved in both structural and regulatory roles. The effects of these additional proteins on transcript elongation are not known, but we have shown that chromatin remodeling proteins genetically interact with elongation regulatory proteins. Thus, we would like to learn what changes occur in the biochemistry and regulation of the elongation reaction during transcription of nucleoprotein templates.</p><p>What are the similarities and differences in regulation of DNA dependent RNA polymerases and RNA dependent RNA polymerases?  We have begun working with the RNA dependent RNA polymerase of hepatitis C virus in vitro to understand the regulation of its replication and to compare the properties of this process with nuclear transcription.</p>"

S"<p>Our studies are focused on understanding inheritance, chromatin structure, gene expression, and the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus. Most of our studies have focused on the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model for chromosome function in metazoans, which allows us to address mechanisms in animals by synergistically combining molecular, genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches. However, we have examined the relevance of our findings to human chromosomes, and have demonstrated surprising similarities between these evolutionarily-distant species. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>We are currently pursuing three projects: 1) analysis of the determinants of centromere identity and function, 2) molecular-genetic dissection of proteins that regulate nuclear organization, and 3) sequence analysis of a poorly characterized genomic component, called heterochromatin. Recent results from the centromere project will be described here; access our lab web site for more details about this and other projects. </p><p>The centromere (CEN) is the chromosomal site associated with kinetochore formation, which is the structure responsible for microtubule attachment to the chromosome, and constitutes an essential component of prometaphase congression, mitotic checkpoint control, anaphase poleward segregation, and cytokinesis. Chromosome gain or loss (aneuploidy) results from having no kinetochore attachments, or multiple attachments. Aneuploidy has catastrophic effects on cells and organisms, and plays a key role in the surprisingly high frequency of human birth defects, and in cancer initiation and progression. How does the cell ensure that one, and only one region of the chromosome attaches to and moves along microtubules?? In other words, how is CEN identity propagated through replication and division? Significant evidence suggests that CEN identity is determined epigenetically, that is by mechanisms that function independent of the primary DNA sequence. Thus, chromatin structure, modification and replication are likely to play a critical role in CEN identity.</p><p> We have studied a constitutive component of centromeric chromatin (CENP-A), which substitutes for histone H3 in CEN nucleosomes. We have demonstrated that CENP-A is both a structural and a functional foundation for kinetochore formation. Three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy analysis demonstrated that CENP-A chromatin in flies and humans appears as a cylindrical structure, and that kinetochore proteins are wrapped around this structure. As expected from the composition of CEN nucleosomes, H3 appears to be excluded from the CENP-A cylinder. However, surprisingly, in analysis of two-dimensional chromatin preparations we observed that blocks of H3-containing chromatin are interspersed with CENP-A _containing chromatin.</p><p> How can we reconcile the uniformity of CENP-A and its separation from H3 in the higher order structure with the interspersion of H3 chromatin observed in two dimensions? We propose that the DNA may spiral (Figure 1) or loop through the cylinder, with CENP-A subdomains `stacked' into a cylinder, to the poleward side of a stack of interspersed H3 subdomains. We suggest that the function of this conserved structure may be to `present' centromeric chromatin to the external face of condensed mitotic chromosomes, where it is accessible to recruit kinetochore components and to attach to spindle microtubules. </p><p>RNA interference in tissue culture cells, live analysis of chromosome segregation after antibody injection into early embryos, and observations of flies with CENP-A null mutations demonstrated that CENP-A is required for all chromosome movements during mitosis and for normal cell cycle progression. Reciprocal epistasis experiments showed that CENP-A is very high in the kinetochore assembly pathway; CENP-A is required to recruit all known kinetochore proteins, but CENP-A localizes to centromeres in the absence of these proteins. We have also demonstrated that failure to form a kinetochore, due to depletion of CENP-A, results in the activation of a cell cycle checkpoint early in mitosis, prior to the time of a previously identified checkpoint known as the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). Thus, CENP-A is physically and functionally positioned to be the epigenetic mark for centromere identity, or is closely associated with the mark. </p><p>If CENP-A is the epigenetic mark for propagation of centromere identity, how is new CENP-A deposited specifically at centromeres in response to replication and division? We hypothesize that `replenishment' in response to replication-generated segregation of CENP-A nucleosomes may be mediated by centromere-specific chromatin assembly complexes (CAFs) or remodeling factors. We are currently focused on in understanding the mechanisms and components responsible for specifically depositing CENP-A into CEN chromatin during or after replication. We have used biochemical and genetic approaches to identify CENP-A interacting proteins, and are determining if these candidates are required for CENP-A deposition. </p>"

S'<p>A progressive trend in materials research, driven in part by the continuing miniaturization of technology, has been towards the synthesis of materials at a resolution complementary to an individual molecule of interest. Our research philosophy deals with the rational design of materials on this length scale for applications in adsorption, catalysis, nucleation and chemical sensing. Our objective is to synthesize amorphous materials that possess a precise functional group arrangement within a pore whose size and shape is controlled over the length scale of several \xc3\x85ngstroms to nanometers.</p><p>To accomplish this we use several distinct synthetic methods. We have the capability to characterize our novel materials by a variety of physical methods, such as multi-nuclear solid state NMR, infra-red, Raman, ultraviolet and fluorescence spectroscopies, physical adsorption experiments, probe molecule binding experiments (selective separations) and catalysis.</p><p>We are currently expanding into the use of other synthetic methods to produce nanoscale functional group arrangement in amorphous materials. Colloidal gold has been utilized to arrange protected thiols around the periphery. Excesses of 2000 molecules can be arranged around a central colloid, allowing for precise arrangement of functionality on a much larger scale than previously possible. Additionally, we are currently examining the use of calixarene macrocycles as prearranged "sites" which can then be covalently tethered to bulk silica. We have developed a method to produce silica-calixarene hybrids stable in excess of 400\xc2\xbaC. Moreover, the proven ability of calixarenes to selectively bind small aromatics is carried over into the hybrid material. </p>'

S'<p>I am interested in the design of large, complex, network-oriented applications and systems. Most recently, I have become concerned with the reliability and trustability of such systems as they are deployed across wide-area networks, with heterogeneous connectivity spanning independent and mutually distrusting service providers. </p><p>Recently, a group of faculty (Jordan, Patterson, Shenker, Stoica, and myself) have been discussing how we can leverage machine learning techniques to build distributed systems that are significantly more reliable and resilient to failures and attacks. The basic idea is to understand system building blocks spanning networks, services, and applications that can diagnose their problems and respond to them. This project is called RADS for Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems, and is still in a very early stage of development.</p><p>My main current project is called OASIS, and focuses on developing a programming model and architecture for embedding new services inside the network. An emerging class of increasingly open programmable network elements, such as "Level 7 Switches," are coming to market. These provide an interesting platform for developing network services, like address and protocol-translation, storage virtualization, load balancing, compression, cryptography, etc. that can operate at line speeds on packet flows. We are interested in how to use these technical developments for implementing more sophisticated services, for application-specific routing and reliability (i.e., overlays), media streaming, and network security.</p><p>My research style is engineering-oriented, prototype- and artifact-driven, and highly interdisciplinary, leading to extensive collaboration with other faculty. Our methodology depends critically on the three step process of (1) evaluating existing systems to understand their performance and capability limitations, (2) extensive simulation-based analyses to explore the design space of new solutions and architectures, and (3) implementation and measurement of the most attractive design to uncover its implementation complexities and to validate the simulation models used in the preceeding step. In a typical project, these steps are iterated two to three times.</p>'

S'<p>My research is motivated by scientific questions about complex systems.  In many cases, existing scientific knowledge about the system is available, sometimes represented in a deterministic computer model, and this knowledge needs to be appropriately incorporated into the statistical inference. One such project involves comparing sources of variability in regional climate model experiments. These computer models of the climate system have been developed to provide high-resolution simulations over limited areas, and their boundary conditions are often provided by lower-resolution, global climate models.  Using a Bayesian functional ANOVA model, I am exploring to what degree, and in which regions, the global-scale forcing contributes to the overall variability in these regional models.</p><p>Much of my applied work concerns environmental and climate problems, and my theoretical interests lie primarily in the realm of spatial statistics.  In particular, I am interested in developing good estimators and predictors for spatial processes.  When the data are large, the usual likelihood methods become computationally infeasible.</p><p> I have developed estimators which are computationally more efficient and shown that they share desirable asymptotic properties with the MLE.  I continue to be interested in the properties of so-called "plug-in prediction" for spatial fields, in which one uses the same data both to estimate the covariance structure of the spatial field and then to predict values of the field at unknown locations.</p>'

S'<p>The primary focus of my research program is the systematics, biogeography, and evolution of members of the beetle family Carabidae, the "predaceous ground beetles". Worldwide in distribution, this family includes more than 40,000 described species and many thousands of additional species yet to be discovered and described. Members of the family are also highly diverse in their form, behavior, habitat preference, and life history. For most of my career, my main research effort has been a monographic study of the genus Nebria Latreille, which presently includes about 500 known species, all restricted to one or both of the northern (Holarctic) continents. To date, 84 species have been distinguished in North America, all confined to cool or cold habitats, and, therefore, found mainly in northern or montane areas. Many species live at the margins of cold mountain streams or alpine snowfields and glaciers, which gives rise to their common name,  the \xe2\x80\x9cice beetles\xe2\x80\x9d. Active mainly at night, they emerge from daytime hiding places under the protective cover of darkness to hunt their prey--other insects and invertebrates. Over the past 40 years, I\'ve monitored and documented significant changes in the altitudinal distributions of these species in responses to climate change. My work with these beetles has taken me to all the major mountain ranges in North America to learn first hand about the distributions, habitat requirements, and other aspects of biology of each species. I am also investigating the evolutionary relationships and geographical histories of members of this group through the study of fossil specimens and phylogenetic analysis.  Concurrently, I am investigating evolutionary relationships among the different subgroups (tribes and genera) of basal grade ground beetles. Such work depends on inference gained from detailed comparative studies of internal and external structure, DNA, life history, behavior, distribution, and habitat. I am also working on faunal inventories for several biodiversity \xe2\x80\x9chotspots\xe2\x80\x9d around the world, including California, Costa Rica, Madagascar, and western Yunnan Province in China.</p>'

S'<p><b>Emotion and Social Interaction</b></p><p>Historically, researchers have concentrated on the intrapersonal characteristics andfunctions of emotion. My own studies have focused on the social functions ofemotion, arguing that emotions enable individuals to respond adaptively to theproblems and opportunities that define human social living. Based on this approachto emotion, I have documented the appeasement functions of embarrassment, thecommitment enhancing properties of love and desire, and how awe motivates attachmentto leaders and principles that transcend the self.</p><p>In related studies of emotional disorders, I have documented relations between angerand embarrassment and juvenile delinquency, laughter and anger and problematicoutcomes during bereavement and sexual abuse, and deficits in self-conscious emotionand autism and patients with frontal lobe damage. In terms of personality, I haveshown that individual differences in positive expressivity, captured from senioryearbook photographs, predict certain personality traits across time, well-being,and marital satisfaction up to 30 years later. We currently are looking at howindividual differences in positive emotions, such as awe, compassion, desire, andpride, shape the individual\xe2\x80\x99s relationships, physical environment, and sources ofpleasure. </p><p><b>Power and Social Perception and Behavior</b></p><p>Power and status imbue almost every facet of social interaction, from linguisticconvention to the economy of emotional expression. I have theorized that elevatedpower leads to behavioral disinhibition and reduced vigilance. I have found thatideological partisans with power construe their dispute in more stereotypical,polarized fashion, that elevated social status leads to disinhibited socialbehavior, and that power, whether derived from group status or experimentalmanipulation, relates to the experience of increased positive emotion and reducednegative emotion. </p><p>I am also exploring the determinants of power and status. Here we have found thatcertain personality traits, namely extraversion for women and men, and lowneuroticism for men, related to attained status in social groups. We have developeda self-report measure of the experience and use of power, and are exploring howthese two factors are distinct, and how they relate to ethnicity, social class,personality, and social outcome.</p><p><b>Negotiating Morality </b></p><p>My final research interest lies in the study of how humans negotiate moral concerns.Here I have examined how opposing partisans tend to assume that they alone see theissues objectively and in principled fashion, a tendency we call "naive realism". Wehave shown that opposing partisans attribute extremism and bias to their opponents. </p><p>In studies of moral judgment, I have shown how emotions such as anger, sadness, andfear influence judgments of causality, fairness, and risk. More recently, I havebegun to study the contents of three moral domains \xe2\x80&#148; autonomy, community, and purity\xe2\x80&#148; and how these domains relate to emotion and prejudice.</p><p>Finally, I have looked more directly at the social practices by which we negotiatenorms and morals, relationships, and interpersonal conflict. I have theorized thatteasing is one process by which individuals socialize, moralize, negotiate statushierarchies and conflicts, and express potentially embarrassing affections. Mystudies of teasing have shown how teasing varies according to social status andromantic satisfaction, development, culture, and in children with autism. I havealso begun studies of gossip and reputation amongst friends. </p>'

S'<p>Research <br /><br />The origin of animals represents one of the pivotal transitions in  life\xe2\x80\x99s history, and one of its greatest unsolved mysteries. While the  fossil record remains silent regarding the rise of multicellularity, the  genetic and developmental foundations of animal origins may be deduced  from shared elements among extant animals and their protozoan relatives,  the choanoflagellates. To better understand the origin and evolution of  animals, our goals are to: <br /><br /> 1. determine the minimal genomic complexity of the unicellular progenitors of animals <br /> 2. elucidate the ancestral functions of genes required for animal development <br /> 3. characterize choanoflagellate cell and developmental biology <br /><br />Current Projects <br /><br />Using comparative genomics to investigate the ancestral animal genome <br /><br />A key question in the origin of animals concerns how and when the  \xe2\x80\x9ctoolkit\xe2\x80\x9d of animal genes was assembled. To test whether genes required  for animal development evolved before the origin of animal  multicellularity, we are comparing sets of genes expressed by  choanoflagellates, animals, Fungi, Plants, and unicellular eukaryotes.  Genes shared only by choanoflagellates and animals were likely present  in their common ancestor and may shed light on the transition to  multicellularity. This work has already provided evidence for the  expression in choanoflagellates of protein families (e.g. receptor  tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and C-type lectins) required for animal  cell signaling and adhesion. Our current goals are to characterize the  diversity of genes encoding transcription factors and cytoskeletal  components in choanoflagellates, and to examine the history of certain  protein families prior to the origin of animals. <br /><br />Assaying the ancient functions of genes required for multicellular development <br /><br />The finding of signaling and adhesion gene homologs (e.g. cadherins  and receptor tyrosine kinases) in choanoflagellates raises questions  about how these genes functioned in the unicellular common ancestor of  choanoflagellates and animals, and what role they played in the origin  of multicellularity. To determine the function of specific genes in  choanoflagellates, we will develop techniques for manipulating gene  activity in vivo. Inferences about gene function in diverse  choanoflagellates provide an important reference point for studies of  gene family evolution in animals. <br /><br />Cell and developmental biology of choanoflagellates <br /><br />The mechanisms by which choanoflagellates form colonies, establish  cell polarity, and reproduce may provide crucial insights into the  transition to multicellularity, but little is known about their cell  biology or natural history. Therefore, we will examine the life cycles  of diverse choanoflagellates using techniques ranging from classical  protistology to microscopy to bioinformatics.</p>'

S'<p>I joined the Berkeley faculty at the beginning of 1989 and I have held the Class of 1954 Chair since 1994. Geographically, my field of research encompasses the Pacific Islands, with particular concentrations in Melanesia and Polynesia. Substantively and theoretically, I am interested in the origins and diversification of the cultures and peoples of the Pacific, in the evolution of complex sociopolitical formations (especially "chiefdoms"), in prehistoric as well as ethnographic subsistence systems (especially those involving some form of intensification), and in the impact of indigenous peoples on the island ecosystems of the Pacific.</p><p> During my eleven years at Berkeley, I have actively pursued research in all of these areas. A continuing focus has been on the Lapita Cultural Complex of the western Pacific, which is widely regarded as the "foundation" culture underlying the later diversity of island Melanesian and Polynesian cultures. In 1989 and 1991, I led an interdisciplinary team on two expeditions to Mangaia Island in the southern Cooks, to investigate the Holocene record of paleoecological change and the role that colonizing humans have had in this record. That research has led to some ten publications and also spawned a graduate student dissertation project. Theoretical work on agricultural intensification, combined with an ethnoarchaeological test case at Futuna in Western Polynesia is frequently cited in the theoretical literature on intensification. Long-term and continuing research on the evolution of Polynesian sociopolitical structures has. Since 1994 I have directed a substantial field program on the island of Maui, again involving both graduate and undergraduate student participation, which focuses on protohistoric transformations in environmentally marginal landscapes.</p><p> Ongoing research projects in Oceanic archaeology and pre-history are coordinated through my Oceanic Archaeology Laboratory and include a major survey and excavation project in Kahikinui, Maui, a study of household archaeology in the Society Islands, and continuing research on human impacts on island ecology.</p><p> My research program at Berkeley has been supported by major grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, and the Pacific Rim Grant program of the UC Office of the President. My research has been recognized in several ways, including election to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. I have also been elected an Honorary (life) member of the Prehistoric Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. I have been a Miller Institute Professor at Berkeley, and a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Palo Alto. In 1997, my research accomplishments were honored with the awarding of the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science by the National Academy of Sciences.</p>'

S'<p>My research interests involve understanding the role of coupled radiation-gas dynamical flows in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In the area of star formation and the dynamics of the interstellar medium these include investigations into various aspects of triggering star formation by ionization-shock fronts in molecular clouds, the interactions of supernova shock waves with clouds in the interstellar medium, and cloud-cloud hydrodynamic collisions. I am also working on the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds leading to the formation of stars in a turbulent medium. Another phase of my research is in the area of high-energy astrophysics. Here I am working on the radiation-hydrodynamics of X-ray pulsar accretion for highly luminous pulsars. This work has recently led my collaborators and I to discover "Photon Bubble Oscillations" (PBO) in the accretion column of the X-ray pulsar Centarus X-3. . The highly time dependent photon bubbles giving rise to these oscillations have significant implications for the light curves of X-ray pulsars, and may lead to important new diagnostics for accretion columns of neutron stars. My collaborators and I have developed new codes to calculate the 2D-radiation transfer in spectral lines and have implemented powerful new methods for multi-dimensional hydro-dynamics. With these methods, I am investigating the self-consistent theory of the formation of coronae and winds associated with AGN and X-ray binaries. The goal is to make direct predictions that may lead to proving the existence of accretion disks associated with active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. We are also applying these methods to the study of line formation in magnetocentrifugally generated winds associated with newly formed stars. Many of these efforts employ state-of-the-art computational techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement hydro dynamics for simulations on the most advanced supercomputers. </p>'

S'<p>The overall focus of our research is the determination of fundamental principles of catalytic and regulatory mechanism in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Our experimental approach is broadly based and combines kinetic, spectroscopic, stereochemical, and molecular biological techniques.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Protein and peptide- derived cofactors.</i> Work over the last decade has forced us to expand our definition of enzymatic cofactors to include structures that are derived from the protein side chains themselves. Early studies by others had implicated simple radicals (e.g., the tyrosyl and glycyl radicals), whereas more recent work, (including much from this laboratory) indicates complex structures that require novel chemical pathways. We are currently focused on four distinct structures that are derived from protein- or peptide-bound tyrosine side chains: the 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanyl quinone (TPQ) found in the ubiquitous copper amine oxidases, the lysine tyrosyl quinone (LTQ) found in the mammalian lysyl oxidases, the cysteine tyrosyl radical (CTR) in the fungal galactose oxidase, and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an essential vitamin for certain bacteria. Studies of the biogenesis of each of these structures require the expression of a precursor protein (or peptide in the case of PQQ), together with the establishment of conditions for monitoring the biogenetic processes. In the case of TPQ, LTQ and CTR all evidence indicates that these are produced by self-processing pathways that occur in the absence of exogenous protein factors, whereas PQQ requires six gene products. Both TPQ and LTQ were discovered in this laboratory and studies on the formation of TPQ are the most advanced, offering valuable protocols for studies of the other systems. In many instances, site specific mutagenesis has proven invaluable, leading to an accumulation of biogenesis intermediates that can be characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques. With regard to the function of these intriguing cofactors, recent studies of the mammalian TPQ-containing copper amine oxidases (found on the outer surface of the endothelium and adipocyte) suggest a role for enzymatically-produced hydrogen peroxide in cell signaling. Many experiments are either in progress or planned, to probe these provocative findings.</p><p><i> Copper- and iron-containing monooxygenases.</i> A very large number of key biological functions involve the use of molecular oxygen. For example, dopamine beta-monooxygenase (DbM) catalyzes the formation of the hormone/neurotransmitter norepinephrine from dopamine. The enzyme is compartmentalized to either chromaffin vesicles in the adrenal gland or synaptic vesicles in the sympathetic nervous system. In contrast to amine oxidases, DbM contains only copper as a cofactor. Key mechanistic questions concern the role of copper in oxygen/substrate activation and the nature of reactive oxygen intermediates. We have developed a set of protocols to study O2 activation which includes distinguishing between O-16 and O-18 reactivity. We are now applying our unique methodology to a range of O2-dependent enzymes, which include dopamine and tyramine beta-monooxygenase; lipoxygenase (an iron protein), peptide amidation enzyme (a copper protein), tyrosine hydroxylase (a pterin/iron system, catalyzing dopa formation from tyrosine), glucose oxidase (a flavo-protein) and cytochrome P-450 (a heme/iron system). Patterns have begun to emerge regarding dioxygen reactivity. Our goal is to systematize biological systems with regard to their mechanism of dioxygen activation. </p><p><i> Nuclear tunneling in enzyme reactions.</i> Over the course of our investigations of enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions, a number of anomalies had arisen which are incompatible with classical views of catalysis. In particular, these anomalies have suggested that quantum mechanical events may play a significant role in hydrogen transfer events at enzyme active sites. During the last several years, we have expanded the database for proteins that use tunneling as part of their catalytic strategy. Virtually every system examined thus far has shown some evidence for tunneling with the properties of tunneling varying depending on enzyme and protein structure, as well as temperature in the case of thermophilic enzymes. The effect of alteration in both substrate and protein structure is under investigation, with the goal of understanding the effect of changes in protein motion and active site geometry on tunneling. We have many interesting and surprising results that include the findings (i) that a single active site residue can control tunneling, and (ii) that thermophilic proteins utilize hydrogen tunneling even at the elevated temperatures of their optimal function.</p>'

S'<p>My research interests center on nonlinear dynamics of dissipative systems. These focus on bifurcation theory, particularly in systems with symmetries, transition to chaos in such systems, low-dimensional behavior of continuous systems and the theory of nonlinear waves. Applications include pattern formation in fluid systems, reaction-diffusion systems, and related systems of importance in geophysics and astrophysics. I am also interested in the theory of turbulent transport and the theory of turbulence.</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>Pattern formation in large aspect-ratio systems: In many problems in physics it is convenient to ignore the presence of distant boundaries. In the theory of pattern formation in continuous systems (e.g. onset of convection in a fluid heated from below) one finds that even distant boundaries can have surprisingly important effects. This is because the boundaries break continuous symmetries (translations/rotations) present in the unbounded system. I am trying to understand under what conditions can sidewall effects be treated perturbatively (the easy case) and when not (the interesting case). This is particularly relevant when the pattern-forming instability produces propagating waves.</p><p>Complex dynamics due to broken symmetries: Even the loss of discrete symmetries can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, the fact that the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s rotation breaks reflection symmetry in planes through the rotation axis is responsible for the pervasive drift of weather patterns. The origin of complex behavior due to forced symmetry breaking can be understood using group-theoretic techniques coupled to bifurcation theory.</p><p>Pattern formation in three dimensions: Very little is known about patterns in three dimensions. Currently I am studying the formation of such patterns arising in models of morphogenesis (the Turing instability). Both steady state and time-dependent patterns are being studied using group-theoretic techniques, and related to specific models of the instability.</p><p>Strongly nonlinear patterns: In fluid systems with strong restraints (for example rapidly rotating systems, or a strong imposed magnetic field) the flow in one or more directions is inhibited. As a result the motion is simplified and asymptotic techniques can be used to cast the pattern formation problem into the form of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. In the case of convection the solution of this problem determines the heat flux across the fluid layer for a given applied temperature difference. This approach promises to be extremely useful in studies of geophysical and astrophysical flows which are almost always highly nonlinear, and has already led to a simplified description of rapidly rotating turbulence which agrees well with full 3d simulations and experiments.</p><p>Nonlinear waves in large systems: In systems supporting nonlinear waves with a preferred direction of propagation the presence of boundaries introduces novel dynamical phenomena. These are associated with absolute instability and produce, for example, chaotic waves in one part of the domain that coexist with laminar waves in another, separated by a shock-like structure. Phenomena of this type are expected to have wide applicability to flows in rotating systems (including dynamo theory) or ones with through-flow and they appear to explain the break-up of spiral waves in certain chemical reactions.</p><p>Parametric instabilities of vibrating flows: A fluid layer vibrated vertically breaks up into a pattern of surface waves. These waves interact with large scale flows which they themselves generate. A description of this interaction is a challenging task but promises to provide an explanation for the dynamics observed in a number of experiments both on this system and on vibrated soap films.</p><p>Dynamics of coupled oscillators: Even very simple systems, such as two coupled nonlinear oscillators, can exhibit dynamical behavior of great complexity, in both relative phase and amplitude. Much of this behavior can be related to global bifurcations in phase space.</p>'

I combine techniques from fluid and solid mechanics with those from biology to do experiments in the field as well as in the laboratory. Using both organisms and physical models, I have studied a variety of problems: the fluid dynamics of how molecules are captured by olfactory antennae and how food particles are filtered from the water by aquatic animals, the mechanisms by which bottom-dwelling marine organisms withstand waves and currents, the evolution of aerodynamic performance in insects and gliding vertebrates, the dispersal of chemical cues and of larvae in turbulent aquatic habitats, and the mechanics of how shape changes are produced in soft-bodied animals and developing embryos. I investigate structure and function on several levels of organization: tissue, organismal, and environmental. I place a strong emphasis on field work as well as on laboratory experimentation. </p>'

The present theory of strong and  electroweak interactions, the Standard Model, has been highly successful  in describing most if not all currently seen phenomena. At the same  time, the theory leaves many important questions unanswered. Why are  there three quark and lepton generations with seemingly hierarchical  mass structure ? What is the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry in  the Universe ? Is there a more complete description of particle  interactions, including gravity, at higher energies ?   <br /><br />While our theoretical colleagues are working on possible answers to  these questions, it is our role as experimentalists to guide them and  help shape up or disprove new theories. New particle accelerators are  being built or planned to study interactions at high energies. On the  other hand, unique opportunities provided by precision electroweak  measurements at lower energies complement the discovery potential of the  highest energy colliders.   <br /><br />Current Projects: <br /><br />My current and future research projects include BaBar experiment at  SLAC in Menlo Park, CA, CUORE neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment  at Gran Sasso underground lab in Italy, and the Mu2e experiment being  built at Fermilab in Illinois. BaBar, which operated between 1999 and  2008, has collected one of the world's largest data samples of bottom  and charm meson decays, tau leptons, and of low-energy e+e-  annihilations. BaBar and its sister experiment, Belle in Japan, have  confirmed the Standard Model description of the most dominant mechanism  for CP violation, or matter-antimatter asymmetry.  Yet, after publishing  over 400 journal papers, our job is not yet complete. Our most recent  work focuses on searches for new physics phenomena, including searches  for light dark matter and low-mass Higgs states, and lepton flavor  violation in tau and Upsilon decays.    <br /><br />CUORE, or Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events, is a  joint project between US and Italy currently being built at the Gran  Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. CUORE will search for an extremely  rare nuclear decay, the neutrinoless double-beta decay of Te-130  isotope. If found, such decays would tell us that neutrinos are their  own anti-particles, placing them in a unique position among all known  fermions, and possibly hinting at a role neutrinos played in creating  the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. CUORE will cool about 1  ton of natural tellurium oxide to the temperatures only 0.01 degree K  above absolute zero, and operate it starting in 2012 in a pristinely  clean environment, nearly free of natural or man-made radioactivity. <br /><br />A future experiment, Mu2e, will search for another very rare process  with profound implications, the muon-to-electron conversion near a  nucleus. In this process, a negative muon captured in an orbit around a  nucleus, spontaneously undergoes a transition to an electron, without  emitting any neutrinos. The process violates the quantum number called  Lepton Flavor, and is nearly forbidden in the Standard Model. However,  it&amp;amp;#039;s predicted to occur, albeit very rarely, in many new  physics theories, such as SuperSymmetry. Mu2e, which is in the early  stages of design development, will aim to be able to see one conversion  event in about ten quadrillion captured muons (in other words,  sensitivity of 1e-16). This unprecedented level of precision would allow  us to test many new physics models, and especially compare them with  observations that could be made at the LHC. Mu2e is planned to start  operating at Fermilab in 2018.</p>"

S'<p>It has become increasing clear that bacterial cells are highly organized with many ultrastructural similarities to eukaryotic cells. In addition to a dynamic cytoskeleton composed of homologues of actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments, many bacteria also possess intracellular membranous organelles. Our lab uses magnetosomes as a model system for studying the molecular mechanisms of organelle biogenesis and maintenance in bacteria. </p><p>The magnetosome chains of magnetotactic bacteria are one of the best-studied examples of membranous bacterial organelles. Magnetosome chains (see figure to the right) contain 15-20 approximately 50-nm magnetite crystals that act like the needle of a compass to orient magnetotactic bacteria in geomagnetic fields, thereby simplifying their search for their preferred microaerophilic environments. The unique properties of magnetosomal magnetite crystals have drawn attention to their potential use in biotechnology, bioremediation, and geobiology and have made them a genetically tractable system for the study of biomineralization. In addition to these applications, the cell biological characteristics of magnetosomes make them ideal for the study of organelle biology in bacteria. Each magnetite crystal within a magnetosome is surrounded by a lipid bilayer, and specific soluble and transmembrane proteins are sorted to the magnetosome membrane. These results suggest that to build a magnetosome a bacterium must be able to generate a membranous comparmtent, target the appropriate set of proteins to this membrane and control their number and position within a cell. </p><p>My lab uses a combination of cell biological, genetic and biochemical approaches to define the physical characteristics of the magnetosome and identify key genes involved in controlling its production and function. Our earlier work showed that the magnetosome membrane is an independent organelle that pre-exists the formation of magnetite and that magnetite synthesis proceeds simultaneously from multiple adjacent magnetosomes. Recently, the work of several groups including ours has led to the identification of a large genomic region with many genes encoding proteins that are localized to the magnetosome and are essential for magnetite formation. The challenge now is to understand the specific functions of these genes and how their products interact to form a magnetosome. </p>'

S'<p>Nerve cells communicate using electrical and chemical signals. We use a combination of molecular, optical, and electrophysiological methods to study ion channels, the proteins that generate electrical signals, and synaptic transmission, the process that allows a neuron to communicate chemically with other cells. Many of our most recent studies utilize novel chemical reagents, designed to manipulate or monitor the function of ion channels and synapses.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Optical studies of synaptic transmission in the retina. Rod and cone photoreceptors of the retina transmit information to other neurons through specialized structures called ribbon synapses. Unlike most synapses, ribbon synapses continuously release neurotransmitter, with the sensory stimulus (light) causing a decrease in the rate of release. We are using lipophilic fluorescence dyes, along with 2-photon, confocal, and electron microscopy, to track the life cycle of synaptic vesicles in photoreceptor terminals. This process starts with endocytosis, includes interactions with the synaptic ribbon, and ends with exocytosis. We are also examining how physiological stimuli, including light and synaptic feedback from other retinal neurons, regulate exocytosis from rods and cones. The use of activity-dependent dyes to stain synaptic vesicles allows us to examine not only individual synapses, but also the behavior of 2-dimensional arrays of synapses while we project visual images on the retina. </i></p><p><i>Constructing "light-activated" ion channels.</i> Neurons have ion channels which are regulated by voltage, chemical transmitters, and mechanical forces. We are trying to engineer the first ion channel that can be directly activated with light. An ion channel protein is coupled through an introduced cysteine to a specially designed light-sensitive molecule that contains a tetraethylammonium group (TEA), which blocks the pore of the channel. The extended form (trans) of the molecule is long enough to allow the TEA to reach the pore, but after photoisomerization the bent form (cis) is too short. Different wavelengths switch the molecule back and forth between cis and trans, so both channel opening and closing should be controllable with light. Expression of these channels in neurons will allow their electrical activity to be regulated with flashes of light. Light-activated channels may have applications in neural computing and eventually serve as an alternative to invasive methods of neural stimulation in the intact nervous system.</p><p><i> Modulation of rod cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels by growth factors and tyrosine phosphorylation.</i> Photoreceptor light sensitivity is altered during light and dark adaptation, processes intrinsic to rods and cones. We are investigating a unique example of modulation by an extrinsic signal, namely growth factors released onto rods by neighboring pigment epithelial cells. Growth factor signal transduction often involves protein kinases and phosphatases specific for tyrosine residues. We find that insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) induces changes in tyrosine phosphorylation, increasing the sensitivity of rod CNG channels and thus altering the light response. Ongoing studies are aimed at elucidating the biochemical cascade linking the IGF-1 receptor and the CNG channel and understanding how tyrosine phosphorylation triggers conformational changes that alter channel activity. Additional studies on transgenic animals will determine the consequences of growth factor effects on vision. </p><p><i>Patch cramming: monitoring intracellular cGMP in intact neurons.</i> We have developed a simple method for monitoring cGMP in intact cells. We use a micropipette to obtain a membrane patch from a Xenopus oocyte expressing mutant CNG channels engineered to be sensitive and selective for cGMP. After calibrating its cGMP response, the pipette is "crammed" into a sufficiently large heterologous cell. Once inside, the activity of CNG channels in the patch reflects the cytoplasmic cGMP concentration. Suitable recipient cells include retinal horizontal cells, neuroblastoma cells, dorsal root ganglion cells, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Using patch cramming we are obtaining the first glimpses of cGMP dynamics in response to neurotransmitters and other stimuli. In particular, we find that some transmitters trigger long-term suppression of cGMP, which is potentially important for synaptic plasticity.</p>'

S'<p>Nearly one-half of all proteins produced in a cell must at some point traverse a cellular membrane. Often, a dedicated integral membrane protein complex\xe2\x80&#148;or translocase channel (TC)\xe2\x80&#148;provides the necessary conduit through which substrate proteins passage. The generality of this problem in biology has meant that many types of translocases have been identified and characterized. The challenge rests in understanding the fundamental biophysical features of transport. Most TCs contain a central pore too narrow to allow a folded protein to passage, thus requiring that the substrate protein unfold. My research group is interested in questions surrounding the mechanisms by which these substrate proteins unfold and how the unfolded chain reptates (or travels like a snake) through the narrow channel. How does a TC initially destabilize or unfold the substrate protein? What drives polypeptide transport? Are the underlying dynamics of the reptating chain best characterized by Brownian-ratchet mechanisms? We seek to address these questions through the study of TCs central to microbial pathogenesis.</p><p>     The process of protein translocation is critical to host-pathogen interactions. By means of TCs, many bacteria secrete toxins and virulence factors or display adhesin molecules on their outermost membranes to successfully disrupt, attach to, and ultimately invade their host. Anthrax toxin, for example, has proved to be a promising model system for the study of protein translocation. The toxin is composed of a TC, protective antigen, that allows the two substrate proteins, lethal and edema factors, to translocate across the host cell\xe2\x80\x99s endosomal membrane. In vitro, we monitor the translocation kinetics of lethal factor traversing through the PA channel using typical electrophysiology methods. My lab seeks to develop anthrax toxin and other microbial translocases into mature biophysical model systems. Electrophysiology combined with spectroscopy and novel single-molecule studies provides a framework for characterizing their function. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of this work to microbial pathogenesis can also be established through parallel in vivo cellular transport studies. It is through a diverse and quantitative approach that we expect to understand the underlying physics of transport.</p>'

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ann Kring&amp;#039;s broad research interests are in basic emotional processes and how they go awry in different psychological disorders. She has studied emotional processes in schizophrenia, depression, social anxiety, and autism.  Her current research is centered on the study of schizophrenia, with studies to assess the linkage between emotion and cognition in schizophrenia using behavior and brain imaging techniques; studies to assess the nature of anhedonia (i.e., diminished pleasure) in schizophrenia; studies to develop and validate a new clinical rating scale of negative symptoms in schizophrenia; and studies to develop and test a new psychosocial treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kring&amp;#039;s work on basic emotion processes in healthy people has been focused on individual differences in expressive behavior, gender differences in emotion, and the linkages between personality, social context, and emotion. Ongoing studies seek to answer questions, such as under what circumstances and in the presence of what individuals might men and women differ in the expression of specific emotions. In addition, other studies seek to understand how social context modifies expressive tendencies, and the ways in which men and women use emotion to negotiate status and power differences.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p><i>Cellular Signal Transduction:</i> Animal cells make decisions regarding growth, differentiation and death by utilizing signal transduction systems that ultimately control the transcription of DNA and the production of protein molecules. This control circuitry relies on cascades of chemical events that are initiated by the activation of cell surface receptors. Our laboratory is pursuing structural and functional investigations involving several components of these signal transduction cascades, particularly those that use phosphorylation as a molecular switch. Many of the proteins we study are important targets for the development of cancer therapeutics, and we explore how structural information can help in this endeavor. </p><p><i>Chromosomal Replication:</i> DNA polymerases that are involved in chromosomal replication polymerize thousands of nucleotides without dissociating from the template. This remarkable property of high processivity is achieved by the attachment of the catalytic machinery to a circular "sliding clamp" that allows the polymerase to move rapidly along DNA while remaining topologically bound to it (above: crystal structure of PCNA, the human DNA clamp). A major effort in the laboratory is aimed at obtaining a complete structural understanding of how processive DNA replication is carried out.</p>'

S'<p>My research program explores the evolution of behavioral diversity among vertebrates, with emphasis on studies of mammals. Specifically, by combining field studies of behavior, ecology, and demography with molecular genetic analyses of kinship and population structure, I seek to identify the causes and consequences of variation in mammalian social behavior. Although I am broadly interested in vertebrate social behavior and sponsor students working on mammals and birds, my current research focuses on studies of subterranean rodents from Argentina and Chile. The objectives of this work are as follows:</p><p><b>1) To identify ecological causes of sociality.</b> Using subterranean rodents as a model system, I am testing the generality of ecological hypotheses that have been proposed to explain group living among mammals. Currently, I am using a comparative approach to identify the factors favoring sociality in two genera of subterranean rodents: Ctenomys and Spalacopus. Because Ctenomys includes both solitary and social species, studies of this genus can be used to explore the reasons for behavioral divergence among closely related taxa. At the same time, comparisons between group-living Ctenomys and Spalacopus provide an important opportunity to identify factors favoring behavioral convergence across larger geographic and taxonomic distances. </p><p>2) To assess the genetic consequences of sociality. Despite compelling theoretical arguments that genetic structure is influenced by social behavior, few empirical studies have explicitly addressed the role of sociality in shaping patterns of genetic diversity. To explore this issue, I am using selectively neutral (microsatellite) and non-neutral (MHC) markers to characterize genetic variation in the subterranean rodent species that are the focus of my field studies of the ecology of sociality. By combining analyses of multiple genetic markers with detailed behavioral and demographic data, this work is generating exciting new insights into the effects of social behavior on patterns of genetic diversification in vertebrates.</p>'

S'George taught at Harvard University from 1965-69, at the University of Michigan from 1969-71, spent 1971-72 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, before coming to Berkeley in 1972. He is also a Senior Fellow at The Rockridge Institute and member of the advisory board of the Frameworks Institute. His current research covers many areas of Conceptual Analysis within Cognitive Linguistics: (i) The nature of human conceptual systems, especially metaphor systems for concepts such as time, events, causation, emotions, morality, the self, politics, etc. This also includes the study of such systems in other languages and their manifestations in linguistic form; (ii) The development of Cognitive Social Science, which applies ideas of Cognitive Semantics to the Social Sciences. It includes practical applications of cognitive linguistics to help social advocates reframe social and political issues; (iii) The implications of Cognitive Science for Philosophy, in collaboration with Mark Johnson, Chair of Philosophy at the University of Oregon; (iv) The cognitive structure, especially the metaphorical structure, of mathematics, in collaboration with Rafael N\xc3\xba\xc3\xb1ez of UC San Diego, Department of Cognitive Science; (v) Neural foundations of conceptual systems and language, in collaboration with Jerome Feldman, of the International Computer Science Institute, seeking to develop biologically-motivated structured connectionist systems to model both the learning of conceptual systems and their neural representations. This includes the development of a neural theory of grammar \xe2\x80&#148; embodied construction grammar \xe2\x80&#148; which precisely characterizes grammars in a notation suitable for both reduction to structured connectionist models and use in natural language processing.'

S'I\'m working on a book on the circulation of gold and silver coins through the textsand the purses of Renaissance England (from about 1540 to about 1610). Focusing on these small and ubiquitous objects gives me an oblique perspective onto some large and rarified questions, such as the ontology of substances, the materiality ofmemory and of anachrony, and the mutual inscription of possessions, the people whopossess them, and the productive powers of the state. The project began in myinterest in the inter-disciplinary rivalry of words and images, as the coin isperhaps the most compressed and most everyday expression of that relation, throughthe portrait and motto that each one bears. Since then, I\'ve discovered that thework I\'m doing brings me in contact with a number of current critical developments,from the self-proclaimed "New Economic Criticism" to the "Thing Theory." My teachingat Berkeley has been split pretty evenly between Shakespeare, on the one hand, andthe variety of his contemporaries, on the other--Spenser, Donne, Marlowe, theJacobean drama--each of whom likewise has a place in the book.'

S'<p>We have been studying the ecology, epidemiology and prevention of tick-borne diseases, particularly the spirochete (bacterium) that causes Lyme disease (LD). LD currently is the most commonly reported vector-borne infection in California, the United States, and in other temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The broad objectives of this research are intended to clarify the transmission cycles of the LD spirochete and other emerging bacterial disease agents; to determine what behavioral and environmental factors place people at elevated risk for acquiring the LDS and other tick-borne infections; and to evaluate control methodologies for reducing such risk. </p><p><i><b>Current Projects</b></i>, Several ongoing projects are aimed at expanding our knowledge of the relationship of various isolates of LD spirochetes (and other emerging tick-borne disease agents in the bacterial genera Anaplasma, Bartonella, Borrelia, and Ehrlichia) to their vectors and vertebrate hosts. Spirochetes isolated from ticks and wildlife are being characterized antigenically and genetically, and the infectivity of selected isolates for vertebrates and ticks evaluated. The ability of human and nonhuman-biting ticks to acquire, maintain and transmit the LD spirochete, and the role of lizards, birds and mammals in perpetuating it have been and still are being assessed both experimentally and in the field. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the vector efficiency of different ticks and to the reservoir competence of mammals also are being studied. </p><p>Another current focus of my research program is to elucidate biotic and abiotic factors that elevate the risk of human exposure to vector ticks in endemic areas of northern California, particularly in dense woodlands and mixed hardwood forests. These studies are being conducted in wildland and recreational areas, and in peri-domestic settings in both rural and semi-rural communities endemic for LD. It is anticipated that these investigations will clarify various ecologic and epidemiologic factors that place humans at heightened risk of exposure to the LDS and other emerging tick-borne infections at different spatial scales, and enable us to develop a predictive model to assess LD risk at both the community and county levels by means of remote sensing and ground-truthing ecologic studies. </p><p>The ultimate goal of this research is to use the basic knowledge gleaned from the foregoing projects to develop and implement strategies for reducing human exposure to tick-borne disease agents. To this end several host-targeted methods for disseminating environmentally safe pesticides to rodent reservoir hosts of the LD spirochete already have been assessed. One method, the delivery of an oil-based formulation of permethrin to wood rats, has shown considerable promise for reducing populations of both vector ticks and fleas. </p>'

S'<p>My main research interests lie in the area of experimental condensed matter physics.  The primary goal is to understand the underlying physics of novel materials and nanostructures and how complexity gives rise to unusual and extreme properties.  Specific research topics include: science and technology of carbon nanostructures such as graphene and nanodiamond, and the science of correlated materials as high temperature superconductors and colossal magneto-resistance manganites. We utilize novel state of the art experimental tools to uncover the electronic properties of materials with energy, momentum, spatial, spin and time resolution (angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), nano-ARPES, Spin-ARPES and laser ARPES).

S"<p>Niklaus Largier, Professor of German and Comparative Literature. He is affiliated with UC Berkeley's Programs in Medieval Studies and Religious Studies, and the Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory. After studying German Literature, Philosophy, and Russian in Zurich and Paris, Professor Largier received his Ph.D. from the University of Zurich in 1989. His research deals with the history of medieval and early modern German literature, especially questions of the relations among literature, philosophy, theology, and other fields of knowledge. His most recent books explore the relation between bodily ascetic practices (in particular flagellation), eroticism, and the literary imagination (Lob der Peitsche: Eine Kulturgeschichte der Erregung. Beck, Munich, 2001; American translation: In Praise of the Whip: A Cultural History of Arousal. ZONE Books, 2007; Spanish translation: Elogio del l\xc3\xa1tigo: Una historia cultural de la excitaci\xc3\xb3n. Oceano, 2010), and the fascination of decadent literature with such religious practices (Die Kunst des Begehrens: Dekadenz, Sinnlichkeit und Askese. Beck, Munich, 2007). Current projects: the history of fantasy and the emotions from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era; the history of the senses, of sense experience, and of the stimulation of the senses-especially taste and touch-in medieval, early modern, and modern cultures. Niklaus Largier is an internationally recognized expert on mystical traditions in German literature and thought, in particular Meister Eckhart and his influence from the Middle Ages to postmodern discourses. His books include a study on time and temporality in late medieval philosophy and literature (1989), a bibliography of literature on Meister Eckhart (1989), a translation and commentary of a medieval treatise on spiritual poverty (1989), a two-volume edition of Meister Eckhart's works with extensive commentaries in the Deutscher Klassiker Verlag (1993), and a study of the significance of exemplum and exemplarity in medieval literature, philosophy, and historiography (1997). Largier has published essays on Eckhart, Tauler, Seuse, Mechthild of Magdburg, Hadewijch, Rudolf of Biberach, Czepko, and others. More recently, a series of articles deals with the interaction of images and texts in medieval manuscripts, questions of visual culture, and the significance of exemplarity in various discursive contexts. He has coedited two collections of essays on spirituality and literature (1995 and 1999), and an important medieval collection of vernacular sermons (1998). Largier is a member of the editorial board of the journal Representations, and of the book series New Trends in Medieval Philology (DeGruyter, Berlin) and Deutsche Literatur von den Anf\xc3\xa4ngen bis 1700 (Lang, Bern et al.). Niklaus Largier is the recipient of a Swiss National Research Foundation Grant (1993/96), of a Fellowship in residence at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities (1992/93), and of a Guggenheim Fellowship (2004). He joined the Berkeley faculty in 2000. From 2001 until 2004 he was the director of UC Berkeley's Program in Medieval Studies, and from 2003 until 2006 he was the director of the Program in Religious Studies. He was a Visiting Professor at Harvard University in 2006. He is a fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin, 2010-11.</p>"

His primary research areas include  analysis of the U.S. energy services company (ESCO) industry and  estimating economic risk to infrastructure from climate change. <br /><br />Previously, Peter served as a senior policy advisor and then Alaska  climate change program manager for The Nature Conservancy. In 2005,  Larsen was recruited to the Institute of Social and Economic Research in  Anchorage, Alaska to build the first defensible model of future  economic impacts of rapid climate change for Alaska. In 2004, Larsen was  hired as a term economist in the Societal Impacts Program at the  National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) where he studied the  sensitivity of the U.S. economy to weather variability. Peter also  worked as a senior associate for Stratus Consulting where he conducted  applied economics research on many diverse topics including wholesale  electricity market monitoring in New England, U.S. energy efficiency  standards, and climate change impacts on the country of Nepal. <br /><br />Peter has taught university-level courses at The University of  Montana, Cornell University, The University of Alaska, and this fall  will be co-teaching a public policy course at The University of  California at Berkeley. Peter's research has been featured (or been  referred to) in the New York Times, USA Today, National Public Radio,  Environmental Science and Technology, and other media outlets within the  United States and abroad. Peter holds an M.S. in natural resource  economics from Cornell University and a B.A. in economics from the  University of Montana-Missoula.</p>"

I co-direct a large international project on this topic, called National Transfer Accounts. Currently 36 countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe, North America and Oceania, each with its own research team, participate in this project. The goal is to improve understanding of the economic consequences of changing population age distributions, including the sustainability of public programs, investment in human capital of children, the interrelation of public and familial systems of intergenerational transfers, and the influence of culture and institutions on the demand for capital. I am also interested in evolutionary life history theory, that is, the theory of how evolution has shaped age patterns of fertility, mortality, parental investment in offspring,and other aspects of the life history of humans and other species. I also work on stochastic projections of demographic variables and government budgets. Related work considers the design of public pension systems and how these perform in a stochastic economic-demographic environment.</p>'

S'<p>Professor Lee is a theoretical condensed matter physicist. The principal goal of his research is to learn new organization principles enabling microscopic degrees of freedom to behave cooperatively in fundamentally new manner. In the context of condensed matter physics this is the search for new states of matter and their formation mechanisms. The kind physical systems which professor Lee works on include: low dimensional quantum magnets, strongly correlated Fermi and Bose fluids, high-transition temperature superconductors, colossal magneto-resistive materials, and strongly correlated nano systems, etc. </p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>The following are some specific examples of Professor Lee\xe2\x80\x99s research.</p><p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Doped Mott insulators. There are two known types of insulators: band insulator and Mott insulator. Band insulators (such as crystalline Si, C, etc) insulate because of the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e., the filling of low-energy bands. Such insulators usually have even number of electrons per unit cell. Doping band insulators produced semiconductors, which is the basis of the modern day technology. Mott insulators have odd number of electrons per unit cell. The reason they insulate is Coulomb blockade. Doping Mott insulators has produced some of the most fascinating materials such as the high-transition-temperature superconductors and the colossal magneto-resistive materials. Both of the above systems possess many competing orders, and have the tendency toward nano-scale phase separation. The purpose of the research is to understand the role Coulomb blockade plays in causing many different ordered states to be nearly degenerate, and its role in nano-scale inhomogeneity. </p><p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Strongly interacting Fermi gas in two dimensions. A new state of matter forms when an two-dimensional electron gas is submitted to strong magnetic fields. This new state, the quantum Hall liquid, is an incompressible quantum fluid. It has soliton-like excitations that carry fractional electron charge, and obey quantum statistics between that of fermions and bosons. In the absence of magnetic field, weakly interacting Fermi gas always insulates. Due to recent experimental discovery, it is possible that strongly interacting electron gas has a non-Fermi liquid metallic state. Whether such state exists is the question this research intends to answer. </p><p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Spin liquid. The question is whether there exists an insulating spin one half systems whose ground state is featureless, i.e., has no symmetry breaking. </p><p>\xe2\x80\xa2 New transport behaviors in disordered media. When weakly interacting fermions move in disordered media they localize. A strong magnetic field fundamentally modifies this behavior and gives rise to critical metallic states with universal conductivity. How does strong interaction affect these behaviors is currently unknown. </p><p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Strongly correlated nano systems. Interesting nano systems (such as carbon nano tubes) have been found to exhibit behaviors that are solely due to electron-electron interaction. Among these behaviors are the Luttinger liquid tunneling characteristics, and possibly the superconductivity of carbon nano tubes. </p>'

S'<p>My field of observational cosmology is really exciting right now. New data are coming in at a rapid pace, answering some questions and raising yet more. Currently, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the primary focus of my research. We can now make accurate maps of the small temperature fluctuations in the CMB, which allows us to test cosmological models, such as inflation, and estimate values for cosmological parameters, such as the total energy density &#937;tot and the baryon density &#937;b. </p><p>In the future, measurements of polarization anisotropy in the CMB will improve cosmological models and allow us to probe the inflationary era directly. A component of the predicted polarization signal results from gravity waves produced during the inflationary epoch 10-38 seconds after the Big Bang. If we can detect this component, we will open a window on Grand Unified Theory (GUT) energy scales.</p><p>I am also interested in investigations of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel\'dovich effect (the scattering of CMB photons by the hot intracluster gas of a cluster). We can learn a great deal about cosmology with the Sunyaev-Zel\'dovich effect by measuring the spatial distribution of clusters in the universe, as well as the distribution of gas in the clusters. </p><p>All of these science goals will require a new level of instrumental sensitivity. To this end, I am involved in the development of bolometric detector arrays. Current instruments are using arrays of 10 to 100 bolometric pixels, but telescopes can accommodate arrays of 1,000 to 10,000 pixels. We are developing bolometer arrays using a combination of superconducting sensors and Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) readout.</p><p><b>Current projects:</b></p><p>MAXIMA is a balloon-borne CMB anisotropy experiment. The balloon flies at an altitude of 125,000 feet to reduce the effect of the atmospheric fluctuations. MAXIMA has recently published an accurate fluctuation power spectrum that covers a factor of twenty range in angular scales. These measurements (along with the BOOMERanG balloon-borne measurements) represent a major advance over previous experiments. Website: <a href="http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/group/cmb" title="http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/group/cmb">http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/group/cmb</a></p><p>MAXIPOL is a CMB polarization experiment using the MAXIMA instrument. It should have sufficient sensitivity to detect the very small polarization signal by integrating deeply on a small patch of sky. We plan to fly the instrument roughly once a year. Website: <a href="http://www.physics.umn.edu/cosmology/maxipol" title="http://www.physics.umn.edu/cosmology/maxipol">http://www.physics.umn.edu/cosmology/maxipol</a></p><p>Bolometer Array development: We are developing bolometer arrays of 1000 or more elements. The bolometer arrays are built with photolithographic techniques and use a superconducting metal biased in mid-transition as the temperature sensor. The detectors are operated at sub-Kelvin temperatures for high sensitivity. We are developing new techniques for coupling the bolometers to the telescope, for example, with planar antennas. Finally, we are developing methods for reading out many bolometers with a single SQUID. Such multiplexing of readouts is an important step for implementing large arrays. Website: <a href="http://www.bolo.berkeley.edu" title="http://www.bolo.berkeley.edu">http://www.bolo.berkeley.edu</a></p><p>Future experiments: We are in the design stage for new experiments that will use the superconducting bolometer arrays. A highly sensitive CMB polarization experiment and a Sunyaev-Zel\'dovich galaxy cluster survey instrument are being planned. </p>'

S'<p>In the Motor Control Lab, we ask questions on the human scale, and answer them at the most direct level, from cell to intact person. We use mathematical models to integrate results from the cell to the intact animal. We have investigated questions from the control of the simplest voluntary movements to the rehabilitation of stroke patients by robots. The questions of immediate interest are: How do muscles stop movements? and How does repetitive motion relate to muscle fatigue and to repetitive motion disorders? </p><p>A key aspect of the control of voluntary movements and locomotion is force production by muscles that are used as brakes. To find out how muscles act as brakes to stop movements, we do experiments on single muscle fibers in vitro. We characterize the biomechanics of muscle fibers, build mathematical models that simulate those mechanics, and test the models by varying the physical and chemical environment of the fibers. Our research agenda is to characterize force production, energy storage and dissipation, then to extend the fiber model back up to the whole animal scale, iteratively comparing model predictions to experiments at each stage.</p><p> With the redesign of workplaces and work, ergonomists have begun to take an interest in fatigue that arises from non-forceful repetitive work. This may be the most common type of fatigue in the modern workplace. Currently we do experiments on intact people to test whether fatigue is an indicator of cumulative repetitive work. This is the first stage in a long term plan to find the connection between fatigue and repetitive motion disorders.</p>'

S"<p>Professor Leone's research interests include ultrafast laser investigations and soft x-ray probing of valence and core levels, attosecond physics and chemistry, state-resolved collision processes and kinetics investigations, nanoparticle fluorescence intermittency, aerosol chemistry and dynamics, probing with near field optical microscopy, and neutrals imaging. <br /><br />Current projects: <br /><br />Current projects in attosecond physics are described here in more detail and follow along several main themes: Isolated attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region are used in time-resolved spectroscopy of atoms, molecules, and condensed matter. These isolated attosecond pulses are produced by high-order harmonic upconversion in a Ne gas target of a few-cycle near-infrared (NIR) pulse into the XUV spectral region. <br /><br />A new method of ionization gating allows the generation of energy-tunable isolated attosecond pulses, as opposed to the conventional amplitude gating method, which yields pulses with limited tunability. This increased energy tunability is critical for the application of isolated attosecond pulses to time-resolved spectroscopy. In addition, we have shown that scanning of the carrier-envelope phase allows rapid determination of the contrast ratio of the isolated attosecond pulse. A variety of complementary attosecond spectroscopic techniques are being pursued and developed in the Leone group. <br /><br />In the first method, initiation of ultrafast dynamics by the XUV isolated attosecond pulse is followed by streak-field detection of the photoelectrons. The dynamics of the various quantum states involved in the time-dependent evolution of the photoexcited state is encoded in the photoelectron spectrum collected as a function of time delay between the XUV pump pulse and the NIR streaking probe pulse. In addition to measuring the photoelectron kinetic energies by linear time-of-flight, photoelectron angular distributions can also be obtained via velocity map imaging. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry is also used to detect photofragments originating from dissociative ionization processes in polyatomics. <br /><br />In the second method, a few-cycle NIR pulse is used to drive plasmon oscillations in metallic nanostructures, thereby mapping the temporal phase of the oscillation to a kinetic energy modulation of the photoelectrons ejected by the isolated attosecond pulse. This method allows direct observation of plasmon decoherence in real time and paves the way for the rational design of plasmonic nanomaterials. In the third method, photoinitiation of coherent electron dynamics by a few-cycle ultraviolet to NIR pulse is followed by isolated attosecond probing of atomic core level absorptions in atoms and molecules. In addition to transient absorption, transient linear dispersion of a sample can also be measured and yields changes in the real part of the refractive index upon initial photoexcitation. For opaque condensed matter samples, transient reflectivity is employed as an alternative to transient absorption, thereby allowing the study of carrier dynamics in solid state nanomaterials on the attosecond time scale. <br /><br />Experiments are being explored in confocal microscopy, apertureless near field optical microscopy, and single pulse coherent anti-Stokes Raman microscopy with phase control, and studies involving quantum dot blinking and pump-probe ultrafast studies of semiconductor nanocrystals. Other projects study aerosol light scattering and spectroscopy, aerosol reactions, as well as surface probing of neutrals desorbed by scanning ion microprobes using the chemical dynamics beamline at the Advanced Light Source. <br /><br />Professor Leone is also available as a research director for the Applied Sciences and Technology (AS&amp;T), Ph.D. program.</p>"

S"Professor Lester's research efforts are focused on theoretical studies of the electronic structure of molecules. Efforts in the former area are directed to extending the powerful quantum Monte Carlo method to the range of chemical problems that form the traditional domain of quantum chemistry, and beyond because of the capability of not imposing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Research by the Lester group has confirmed that highly accurate ground state and excited state energies are attainable by the method. Properties other than the energy including dipole and quadrupole moments as well as matrix elements connecting different electronic states (oscillator strengths and lifetimes) have been determined following algorithms developed by his group."

S'<p>My lab studies gene networks that control animal development and disease. Particular efforts focus on the control of segmentation and gastrulation in the early Drosophila embryo, the immune response in Drosophila larvae, and the differentiation of the notochord and heart in the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>We are currently conducting a whole-genome analysis of gastrulation in the Drosophila embryo. This process is initiated by a maternal transcription factor called Dorsal, which is distributed in a broad concentration gradient across the dorsal-ventral axis of the early embryo. High levels of the gradient initiate the differentiation of the mesoderm, while low levels control the development of the neurogenic ectoderm and dorsal ectoderm. An extensive microarray screen identified as many as 40 new Dorsal target genes, including a Rho GTPase, an FGF-like signaling molecule, an ADAM metalloprotease, and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Some control the invagination of the mesoderm through the ventral furrow, while others are essential for the spreading of the mesoderm along the internal surface of the neurogenic ectoderm. It is possible to describe gastrulation in terms of threshold readouts of the Dorsal gradient. High levels of Dorsal activate target genes required for the invagination and spreading of the mesoderm, such as the FGF receptor Heartless. In contrast, low levels of the gradient activate secreted signaling molecules in the neurogenic ectoderm that control the behavior of the neighboring germ layers. </p><p>There are ~50 Dorsal target genes in the Drosophila genome, and a variety of bioinformatics methods allowed us to isolate enhancers for 15 of these genes. Coordinately regulated enhancers that respond to similar thresholds of the Dorsal gradient contain shared sequence motifs. Dorsal target enhancers are typically 500 bp in length and contain clustered binding sites for transcriptional activators and repressors (including binding sites for Dorsal itself). Simple clustering of binding sites is not sufficient to unravel a "cis-regulatory code", which links primary DNA sequence to differential gene activity. The elucidation of a cis-code depends on "grammar", that is, a fixed organization of cis-regulatory elements, such as helical phasing between two adjacent activator sites that work in a synergistic fashion to stimulate transcription. We are obtaining evidence that a fixed grammar governs the immune response in Drosophila larvae. Many immunity genes contain closely linked binding sites for Rel and GATA transcription factors. The binding sites are organized in the same relative orientation, and inverting the sites causes a severe reduction in the immune response. </p><p>The sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis, is a simple chordate with a small genome that has been recently sequenced and assembled. The Ciona genome represents a simplified version of vertebrate genomes. Large gene families in vertebrates are represented by just a few members in Ciona. For example, there are 22 FGF genes in a typical vertebrate, but only 6 in Ciona, and each of these corresponds to a subfamily of 3 or 4 vertebrate genes. The Ciona tadpole is initially composed of just ~1,000 cells and there is complete lineage information. It is possible to introduce transgenic DNAs into developing embryos using simple electroporation methods. For this reason we have been able to isolate large numbers of tissue-specific enhancers, including those that mediate gene expression in the notochord and neural tube. Bioinformatics methods are being used to identify shared sequence motifs within coordinately regulated enhancers. We hope to use this information to identify and characterize orthologous enhancers in vertebrates.</p>'

Professor Li is actively involved in expanding the curriculum and promoting graduate/undergraduate research activities in the area of cell and tissue engineering. Professor Li has introduced a new course on Cell and Tissue Engineering, which is offered in spring semester.</p><p>\tThe long-term goal of our research is to engineer stem cells for cell therapy and tissue regeneration.  Our current research involves bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, vascular progenitor cells, mouse embryonic stem cells and human embryonic stem cells.  Some of our current approaches include:  (1) Characterization of stem cell differentiation in response to mechanical, electrical and chemical factors in bioreactors; (2) Three-dimensional culture of stem cells in native matrix and micropatterned/nano-patterned biodegradable polymers, with the purpose to control the morphogenesis of artificial tissue derived from stem cells; (3) Genomic and proteomic profiling of stem cells to identify molecular switches and markers during stem cell differentiation; (4) in vivo model for the regeneration of cardiovascular and connective tissues.  For embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we will promote their self-renewal and control their differentiation in bioreactors. After we characterize and isolate ESC-derived progenitor cells, these cells will be used for cell therapy or for the fabrication of functional tissues. In vivo tissue repair model will be used to determine whether and how the cells and tissue constructs can repair and regenerate native tissue.</p>'

S'<p>I am a North American archaeologist who has worked in New England, the American Southwest, and the Pacific Coast of North America. I specialize in the study of coastal hunter-gatherer peoples, culture contact research, and the archaeology of colonialism. Since joining the Berkeley faculty in 1987, my research has focused on Native Californian peoples and their encounters with early European explorers and colonists.  I work primarily in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.  My recent research projects include field work at Fort Ross State Historic Park, where a collaborative team of scholars are considering the long-term implications of multi-ethnic interactions between Russians, Native Alaskans, and Native Californians (primarily Kashaya Pomo and Coast Miwok) at Colony Ross (1812-1841).  I am also involved in the reanalysis of archaeological collections housed in the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology from the impressive shell mounds of the bay area, which date back several thousand years. I am also participating in a collaborative research program at A\xc3\xb1o Nuevo State Park and Pinnacles National Park with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, California State Parks, and the National Park Service, the purpose of which is to evaluate archaeological and ecological evidence of indigenous landscape management practices, specifically the common use of prescribed burning to enhance the biodiversity and quantity of useful plants and animals in local habitats.</p><p>My recent publications include <i>Indians, Missionaries, and Merchants: The Legacy of Colonial Encounters on the California Frontiers</i> (2005, UC Press) and <i>California Indians and their Environments: An Introduction</i> (with Otis Parrish) (2009, UC Press).</p>'

S"<p>My research interests are in the areas of experimental space physics and high energy astrophysics. Specific topics in space physics include solar flares and solar cosmic rays; the interplanetary medium and associated plasma phenomena such as collisionless shock waves, particle acceleration, and wave-particle interactions; the Earth's magnetosphere and aurora; and lunar, planetary, and cometary studies. In high energy astrophysics I have concentrated on high resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectroscopy of line and continuum emissions from cosmic sources as well as the Sun. These emissions provide detailed information on processes such as positron annihilation near black holes, cyclotron emission in the strong magnetic fields of neutron stars, radioactive decay of newly formed isotopes in supernovae, and the interaction of accelerated particles with matter. My approach is to develop innovative instruments and fly them on spacecraft, rockets, and balloons. </p><p>Current Projects </p><p>The Sun is the most energetic particle accelerator in the solar system, producing ions up to tens of GeV and electrons to hundreds of MeV in flares and fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Solar flares are the most powerful explosions, releasing up to 10^32  - 10^33  ergs in 10^2 - 10^3  s. The accelerated 10 -100 keV electrons and &gt;~1 MeV ions often appear to contain the bulk of this energy, indicating that the particle acceleration and energy release processes are intimately linked. How the Sun releases this energy, presumably stored in the magnetic fields of the corona,and how it rapidly accelerates electrons and ions with such high efficiency, and to such high energies, is presently unknown. My group developed the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) space mission (launched in 2002) for imaging and spectroscopy of bremsstrahlung hard X-ray/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines produced by the energetic electrons and ions, respectively. It has provided the first hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy, the first high-resolution spectroscopy of solar g-ray lines, the first imaging above 100 keV, and the first imaging of the g-raylines. RHESSI has also detected the ^26 Al gamma-ray line from galactic nucleosynthesis and shown that it is narrow, and detected strong polarization in a cosmic gamma-ray burst.</p><p>A major goal in space plasma physics is to understand the interaction of the large scale plasma system of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind. This interaction leads to magnetic storms, aurorae, and the acceleration of the radiation belt particles, by plasma processes that are not well understood. We have developed experiments for a large number of spacecraft \xc2\xad Wind,Polar, Geotail, IMAGE, FAST, Cluster, STEREO, etc. (launch dates from 1994 to 2006),  - in different locations in the Earth's magnetosphere and the heliosphere to study these phenomena. We also have rocket and high altitude balloon programs that are ideal for graduate student training. We have developed instruments to map the surface magnetic fields of Mars and the Moon with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, by means of electron reflection magnetometry, i.e. the detection of electrons reflected back from a region of enhanced magnetic field strength. Correlations of the distribution of the near-surface magnetic fields with surface geological features can then give detailed information on the origin and history of Mars and lunar magnetism. This information, in turn, can provide constraints on the physical processes undergone by these planetary bodies in their evolution: core formation, thermal evolution of the crust, impact and tectonic processes, erosion, etc. In addition these electron plasma measurements can be used to study the interaction of these planetary bodies with the solar wind. These instruments are on the Mars Global Surveyor mission presently in orbit, and was on the Lunar Prospector mission. </p>"

S'<p>The history, interactions, and relationships of the taxa that we study are the threads that unite the various temporal and spatial scales of our research. This approach requires that we employ a wide variety of techniques, including paleontological, geological, and biogeographical data, along with comparative morphology, developmental biology, long-term experimental manipulations, phylogenetic studies, and molecular techniques. My systematic work features the Patellogastropoda, a basal group of gastropod molluscs that figure prominently in ecological studies of rocky shores around the world. We use phylogenetic hypotheses to understand adaptation and evolution in patellacean faunas around the world and through time. I also remain interested in the role of substrates in determining and augmenting community composition. Some effort in our lab is also directed at understanding the evolutionary history of California land snail taxa as well. I also investigate relationships amongst higher molluscan taxa including subclades within the Gastropoda, the "conchiferian" groups, and the phyletic position of the Mollusca on the Tree of Life.</p><p> A recurrent theme in many of these studies is the role of heterochrony, especially in the evolution of morphology, life history strategies, and reproductive systems in molluscs. This work focuses on the intersections of phylogeny and development using different developmental data sets and tools and comparisons across levels of organization and the phylogenetic hierarchy. </p><p>Research topics selected by my graduate students are often outside my own areas of interest, but share a phylogenetic framework, include fossil as well as living organisms as study taxa, and are concerned with the nearshore marine environment. </p>'

Paleobiologic projects include the evolution of the earliest shelled protists in the Precambrian and Cambrian and the biologic constraints on mass extinctions and radiations. Foraminifera are used in environmental analyses of marshes and detection of past seismic histories of megathrust earthquakes. These are field-oriented projects utilizing scuba and geologic work.

S'<p>I have broad interests in plasma physics and nonlinear dynamics, and in atomic, molecular, optical, and nuclear physics. I share interests and office space with Allan Kaufman (theoretical plasma physics); sometimes we have shared the supervision of graduate students. Projects in recent years, mostly carried out with students, have included studies of dissipation in many-particle systems (the "ergodic adiabatic invariant"); a semiclassical treatment of spin-orbit forces in nuclei; a normal form theory for mode conversion or Landau-Zener transitions in plasma physics and other areas of physics; topological aspects of semiclassical quantization; and the role of symmetries in periodic orbit representations of chaotic quantum systems. The unifying themes in this work are Hamiltonian dynamics, short-wavelength asymptotics, the classical-quantum correspondence, geometrical and topological methods, and symmetry. </p><p><b>Current Projects </b></p><p>One recent project concerned mode conversion. Waves in a medium typically come in a variety of "modes," each of which is characterized by a definite dispersion relation and polarization. When a wave of one mode enters a region of space where the dispersion relation is nearly degenerate with that of another mode, there occurs the process of "mode conversion," in which action is transferred from the original mode to the second one. Examples include the conversion of radio-frequency electromagnetic waves to electrostatic waves in the ionosphere; the conversion of shear and pressure waves in an elastic solid; the excitation ("surface crossing") of electronic states in slow atomic or molecular collisions; and the coupling of acoustic and gravity modes in the oscillations of stars. We have shown that in the most generic or typical cases, different mode conversion processes are related to one another by certain symmetry transformations, which include scaling transformations, linear canonical transformations, and a group of transformations which are mathematically identical to Lorentz transformations. These symmetry groups lead to a unified treatment of mode conversion, in which any actual problem can be transformed into a standard or normal form, and physical quantities (S-matrix elements) are invariant under all the symmetries. This work was done in collaboration with Allan Kaufman and my former student, Greg Flynn. </p><p>Another recent project concerned phase space representations of optical wave fields. The original motivation arose in the subject of nonimaging optics, in which the goal is not to create an image, but rather to transmit or concentrate radiation within the constraints of the laws of thermodynamics. In this theory, the state of a field of optical radiation is specified by a function on phase space, like a photon distribution function but also containing information about interference and diffraction effects. A curious feature about these distribution functions is that they may take on negative values, even though measurements of radiance and other physical quantities always give positive results. In effect, one has "negative probabilities" in the mathematical description, although the uncertainty principle prevents negative probabilities from ever being measured. In a collaboration with Roland Winston of the University of Chicago, we have investigated the propagation of such pseudo-distribution functions and their relation to the measurement process. </p><p>The most recent project involves n-particle systems with rotation invariance, such as atoms, molecules or nuclei with reasonably small numbers of particles. The problem of separating rotations from internal motions in such systems is an old one, but only recently has it been realized that the process involves certain gauge fields. These gauge fields physically represent Coriolis forces, and cause the Hamiltonian for the reduced dynamics to have the form of a particle interacting with a SO(3) Yang-Mills field. My students and I have begun a systematic investigation to see what the impact of this new realization is on practical n-body problems. We have studied the geometry and topology of the reduced configuration space, and the symmetries of the dynamics there; we have investigated the freedom of choices of gauge; we have studied the monopole singularities which occur in the Coriolis field; we have discovered a set of field equations satisfied by the various fields on the reduced space; and we have investigated practical representations for various operators in the reduced description. This work is continuing; in the future, we plan to work on gauge-invariant perturbation methods and other matters. </p>'

S'<p>When a correlation between the chemical structure and a physical property of a material is postulated, measurements on compounds exhibiting a range of structural variations are required to establish its validity and, ultimately, to optimize performance for an application.  Yet the controlled modification of inorganic structures remains, in many instances, an open challenge.  Our research is directed toward developing general strategies for the synthesis of inorganic clusters and solids.  </p><p>Recent mass spectrometric investigations have provided tantalizing glimpses of large new classes of metal-nonmetal clusters generated in the gas phase by laser ablation.  Reactor systems intended to produce bulk quantities of ligand-stabilized analogues of these species are being tested.  Characterization of the clusters resulting from this versatile synthetic technique should provide insight into the fundamental processes involved in the transport, nucleation and growth of binary solid materials.  </p><p>A practical formalism for manipulating the degree of connectivity in simple solid frameworks is being elaborated.  Termed dimensional reduction, the method relates how a binary parent solid can be dismantled by incorporating additional anions that serve to terminate intermetal bridges.  A database of binary and ternary metal-halide and metal-chalcogenide structures is currently being analyzed to evaluate the scope and limitations of this formalism.  Its utility will then be tested by applying dimensional reduction in the synthesis and characterization of new solid materials. </p><p>Magnetic bistability has now been observed in several high-spin clusters, raising the possibility of storing data at an extremely high density by localizing each bit of information in a single molecule.  However, to improve the durability of data storage, clusters with a substantially higher demagnetization energy barrier (S2|D|) must be synthesized.  The relative simplicity of the structures and exchange pathways in metal-cyanide cluster systems should make them much more amenable to the design of such single-molecule magnets than previously studied metal-oxo systems.  Directed assembly routes to constructing high-spin metal-cyanide clusters are under investigation.  </p><p>The demand for new porous materials that function as molecular sieves and catalysts has prompted interest in crystal engineering, a solution-based route to solid synthesis.  The problems of interpenetrating frameworks and architectural frailty often encountered with this method can be avoided by using isotropically expanded structural components.  For example, replacing the Fe2+ ions in Prussian blue with larger [Re6Q8]2+ (Q = Se, Te) cluster cores more than doubles the volume of the framework cavities.  Characterization of these and related porous materials is ongoing. </p>'

The objective is to explain and predict the properties of materials using first-principles theories and computations.</p><p><b>Current Research Projects</b></p><p>A major interest of my group is nanoscience, in particular, systems involving nanotubes. Nanotubes are tubular structures, typically several nanometers in diameter and microns in length. These quasi-1D materials have novel properties (e.g., chiral currents and quantized conductance) of fundamental and practical interest. Systems being studied include defects on nanotubes, nanotube junctions, and nanopeapods. Various structures consisting of assembly of nanotubes and other nano-objects such as fullerenes and clusters are also being investigated.</p><p>The properties of a solid are dictated by the interacting electrons and ions in the system. Many properties are strongly affected by electron correlation effects. We are developing many-body perturbation methods and quantum Monte Carlo methods for studying these effects in real materials. In particular, first-principles one-particle and two-particle Green\xe2\x80\x99s function approaches are used to compute quasiparticle energies and optical spectra for interpreting spectroscopic data and to predict phenomena such as photo-induced transformations. Quantum Monte Carlo techniques are used to determine ground-state properties of correlated electron systems. Many-electron effects (e.g., electron-hole interaction in optical processes) are particularly dominant in reduced dimensional systems such as surfaces, polymers, and clusters. </p><p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an important tool for studying the chemical, electronic and structural properties of liquids and solids. We have developed a method which allows the ab initio calculation of NMR chemical shifts in extended systems. This approach is applied to investigate crystals, amorphous solids, and liquids. </p><p>Hardness is a macroscopic property that is far from well understood. We are investigating the limits of the mechanical strength of solids, with the goals of understanding the physical origins of hardness and predicting new hard materials. </p>'

S'<p>We are interested in the signal transduction pathways downstream of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) receptors and the role these pathways play in regulation of mammary epithelial cell differentiation and breast carcinogenesis. We wish to understand how TGFb induces a wide range of biological activities and identify components of the TGF beta receptor signaling pathways.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The TGF beta family of cytokines plays important roles in tumor suppression, cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis, and extracellular matrix production. TGFb exerts its diverse effects through the cell surface types I and II receptors (TbRI and TbRII), which possess serine/threonine kinase activities, and downstream Smad proteins. Loss of functional TGFb receptors and/or Smad proteins results in abnormal cell overproliferation, and this may contribute to the cause and progression of many types of human cancer including breast cancer, lymphoma, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. A better understanding of the mechanism of TGFb receptor signal transduction is therefore a crucial first step towards a better understanding and treatment of human cancer.</p><p><i> Current model of TGFb signaling:</i> Binding of TGFb to the cell surface receptors results in activation of receptor kinases, which then phosphorylate and activate downstream Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of multiple TGFb response genes. </p><p>We are interested in understanding how this relatively simple pathway mediates such a wide variety of TGFb-induced signals and what role this pathway plays in mammary gland development and breast cancer. Our current research is designed to address the following questions: </p><p><i>How does Smad proteins activate a wide range of TGFb-induced biological functions and how is this signaling pathway regulated?</i> Our working hypothesis is that the Smad proteins activate multiple TGFb target genes by interacting with different cellular partners. Our goal is, then, to identify these cellular partners and to investigate the roles these molecules play in regulation of Smad function. Using biochemical approaches, we have identified several molecules interacting with different Smad proteins. Interestingly, two of the molecules we identified, Ski and SnoN, are both oncogene products. These oncoproteins, when overexpressed, can induce transformation of cells. We found that Ski and SnoN can interact with Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 on a TGF beta responsive element and repress the ability of the Smads to activate TGF beta target genes. Overexpression of Ski or SnoN renders cells resistant to TGFb-induced growth inhibition. This ability to inactivate the tumor suppressor activity of the Smads may be partially responsible for the transforming activity of Ski and SnoN. Current studies focus on how expression of Ski and SnoN is regulated in normal and cancerous cells, and how interaction of Ski/SnoN with the Smad proteins regulates carcinogenesis and embryonic development. We are also investigating the function of other Smad-interacting proteins we have identified.</p><p><i>What is the role of TGF beta signaling pathway in mammary epithelial cell differentiation and breast cancer?</i> In vitro studies using tissue culture cell lines allow us to carry out biochemical studies to understand the function and regulation of individual signaling molecules. Once this goal is achieved, we wish to apply this knowledge to an in vivo system and try to understand the role of the signaling pathway in a complex biological process. For this, we will use mammary epithelial cell differentiation and breast cancer as a model system. By introducing dominant negative and constitutive active mutants of TGFb signaling molecules, we will attempt to address the importance of TGFb signaling in different stages of mammary epithelial cell differentiation and how deregulation of TGFb signaling contributes to breast cancer.</p>'

S"Professor Lyndon's work as an architect, author and educator concerned with the design of places has been widely recognized. Within CED he is a member of the Graduate Group for the Design of Urban Places and teaches in both the Architecture and Master of Urban Design programs. He is the Editor of PLACES, a journal of environmental design, author of The Sea Ranch (with Jim Alinder) and The City Observed: Boston, and co-author of Chambers for a Memory Palace and The Place of Houses. He serves on the Boards of the International Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Design, in Italy and of the Charles Moore Center for the Study of Place in Austin TX. He is Chair of the Board of Directors for the Kronos Performing Arts Association and has served as a member of the Architectural Advisory Board for the US State Department's Office of Overseas Building Operations. His architectural and urban design practice has included a continuing series of works at the Sea Ranch CA, where, with MLTW (Moore Lyndon Turnbull Whitaker), he was one of the designers of Condominium One, (1965) which subsequently received the distinguished 25 year Award from the AIA. He has continuing architectural work there and has been the architect for projects elsewhere in California, Texas, New England, the South and the Northwest. His urban design practice in California has included plans for Pasadena, Menlo Park and Berkeley, including the Bayer Bio tech campus and the Downtown Public Improvements Master Plan for Berkeley. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, his work has received numerous design awards and he is frequently asked to serve on architectural competition juries. Lyndon served as Head of the Department of Architecture at the University of Oregon, and at MIT, and is a former Chair of the Department of Architecture at Berkeley. His work as an educator was honored in 1997 with the AIA-ACSA's Topaz Award, the highest award in architectural education, and he has served as a Chancellor's Professor and as the Eva Li Professor at Berkeley.

The micro approach uses data on transactions in currency markets to address how this market absorbs new information.

S'<p>Understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies and large scale structure in the Universe has been the central theme of my recent research. With the aid of large supercomputers, my collaborators and I have performed numerical simulations of the clustering of dark matter in various cosmological models of structure formation from the Early Universe until the present day. By comparing the simulation results with astronomical observations, constraints can be obtained on the nature of dark matter such as the mass of neutrinos and on cosmological parameters such as the density and expansion rate of the Universe. Another part of my research effort has been on the computation of the temperature variations imprinted on the cosmic microwave background radiation which provides a snapshot of the infant Universe. Other interests include theoretical particle physics and classical violin performance. </p>'

S'<p> The general goal is to determine how cytoplasmic and organellar Ca, pH and redox properties contribute to physiology and pathophysiology of secretory epithelial cells.</p><p><i><b>Current Projects</b></i></p><p> The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) is a Cl and HCO3 channel located in the apical membrane of trachea and other secretory and absorptive epithelia. The genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in CFTR that lead to reduced function of CFTR, resulting in altered luminal ionic milieu, accumulation of viscous mucus with altered biochemical properties, reduced activities of anti-bacterial products secreted by epithelial cells and accumulation of bacteria and neutrophils in affected tissues. </p><p> Patch clamp and transepithelial electrophysiology are used to investigate the Cl and HCO3 permeability properties of the CFTR channel, which is key to determining the secretory and absorptive properties of epithelial cells in the lung airways. Digital imaging microscopy is used to test the potential role of CFTR and other ion transport pathways in the key ability of the airway epithelial cells to secrete H+ and HCO3- into the airway surface liquid. We use molecular, biochemical and immunomicroscopic methods to identify and then determine the cellular and membrane location of these transporters.</p><p> To test the hypothesis that CFTR controls processing and trafficking functions of endosomes, Golgi, TGN and mucus secretory granules through effects on pH or redox potential of the organelles, we use digital imaging microscopy and genetic targeting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and organic fluorescent dyes to determine how the channel affects the pH and redox regulatory properties of organelles in intact, living cells.</p><p> Using imaging microscopy combined with molecular, biochemical and immunomicroscopy methods we are characterizing the interactions between epithelial cells and bacteria in an attempt to determine the early events that precede inflammatory events like invasion by neutrophils. One of the key events in CF and other inflammatory diseases is that bacteria that accumulate in the airways induce neutrophils to migrate from the capillaries across the epithelial surface and into the airway lumen to attack the foreign invaders. The epithelilal cells help orchestrate this event. We are testing the hypothesis that bacteria (and particular gene products of the bacteria) stimulate the epithelial cells by activating receptors that lead to alterations in [Ca] and cyotsolic redox and other signaling pathways and activation of multiple epithelial genes that are involved in the inflammatory and hypersecretion responses characteristic of the diseased state.</p>'

S'<p>My research interests lie in exploring historically specific articulations of secular modernity in postcolonial societies, with particular attention to issues of subject formation, religiosity, embodiment, and gender. In my book, Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminsit Subject (Princeton University Press, 2005), I address some of these issues through an ethnography of a women?s piety movement that is part of the larger Islamist movement in Egypt. There are three primary issues that frame my interest in Islamist movements in postcolonial Muslim societies: In what ways do these movements help us rethink the normative liberal account of politics? How do the politics of gender in these movements parochialize key assumptions within feminist theory? How does a consideration of the debates about embodied practice among Islamists and their secular critics help us understand the conceptual relationship between the specificity of bodily form and the process of subject formation? My current project focuses on secular-liberal interpretations of Islam in the context of the Middle East and South Asia. Islamic liberal thought has increasingly come to be imagined as a site of hope that has the potential of saving Islam from its more militant and fundamentalist interpreters?a hope that has only mushroomed since the events of September 11, 2001. Yet it seems like we understand very little about what exactly this object called ?liberal Islam? is and why it appears to have such salvific qualities. My current project is an exploration of the writings of key Muslim reformers from the early twentieth century, as well as some of their contemporary followers in Pakistan, India, Egypt, and Syria, who have attempted to integrate key precepts of liberal political thought within Islamic modes of reasoning and argumentation. In addition to analyzing how certain secular-liberal principles have been reformulated within discourses of Islam, I am interested in exploring the!  texture of those ineffable modes of attachments that form the substrate of rational arguments and judgments within this liberal discourse. By incorporating ethnographic fieldwork with historical analysis, I hope to build upon my earlier work on embodied capacities to think through the visceral modes of appraisal that undergird liberal, conservative, and radical political projects alike despite the important differences between them.Before pursuing a PhD in anthropology, I also studied and practiced architecture with a short lived foray into the study of political science. My involvement in these fields continues to inform my navigations through the anthropological terrain in unexpected ways.</p>'

S'<p>Our research concerns two parallel projects. In the bioanalytical area, our long term goal is the design of reagentless, disposable protein and DNA micro-array sensors capable of performing simultaneous, multi-component immunoassay analysis using smaller samples and requiring less involved procedures than currently existing techniques while providing equal or superior sensitivity. At a fundamental level, it concerns a possibility of controlling the position of equilibria of biological exchange reactions, such as those involved in antibody-antigen binding and exchange, by using a small external force directed to stretch an antibody-antigen complex involved in the exchange reaction.</p><p>We are investigating this general question now as we design a new class of reagentless protein micro-sensors.  These sensors could have a large impact on the field of medical diagnostics since our methodology offers, in principle, a simultaneous, ultra-sensitive, detection of a specific panel of many proteins in a microliter sample of a physiological fluid using a reagentless protocol and disposable micro-sensor devices. In the area of interfacial chemistry we investigate dynamic behavior of monolayer assemblies at liquid/gas and solid/liquid interfaces.</p><p>We are interested in understanding how composition and structure of monolayer assemblies affect the dynamics of such processes as long range electron tunneling, lateral molecular diffusion and vectorial proton transport. Our underlying goal is to address issues relevant to the behavior and functioning of biological membrane systems. For example, Langmuir techniques, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), 2D electrochemical methods, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy are used to study lateral mobility of lipids at the air/water interface in order to understand physical properties of lipid monolayers and to probe the water liquid-vapor interfacial region. We want to learn about the dynamic properties of this important interfacial region and to understand how they differ from the properties of bulk water.</p><p>Likewise, we want to understand what types of interactions determine phase behavior and the lateral dynamics of lipid monolayer films on the water surface. How does their mobility depend on their immersion depth, surface density and on the physical properties of the interfacial water region?</p>'

I suspect that certain singular string backgrounds may be equivalent to topology changes, and that it is consequently only necessary to sum over string backgrounds. As a start I am investigating topology changes in two-dimensional target spaces. I am also interested in Seiberg-Witten invariants. Although much has been learned, some basic questions remain, and I hope to be able at least to understand the simpler of these questions. </p>'

S"<p>Research in this laboratory is focused on structure/function relationships in proteins with a particular emphasis on the catalytic and biological properties of enzymes. Research questions are being answered using both the tools of chemistry and molecular biology.</p><p>Current Projects, Cellular signaling with NO typically acts in paracrine fashion, where one cell that makes NO signals an adjacent target cell. NO is both toxic and chemically reactive, properties that argue against a key role in signaling. It is freely diffusible, and the chemical instability of NO leads to a cellular messenger whose signal lifetime is dictated by this instability. NO stimulates the synthesis of guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, (cGMP) in a target cell by directly activating the soluble isoform of guanylate cyclase (sGC). Constitutive isoforms of NOS make NO for signaling. The immune system, on the other hand, uses NO to kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens, generated via the inducible isoform of NOS.</p><p>Our current efforts are focused on (i) the mechanism of NOS, (ii) activation and deactivation of sGC, (iii) molecular mechanism of tolerance to nitrovasodilator drugs, and (iv) targets of NO action in immune system function.</p><p>Nitric Oxide Synthase. NOS catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine to NO and citrulline. NOS contains two tightly bound flavin cofactors that deliver reducing equivalents to a cytochrome P-450-type heme. The enzyme also contains a tightly bound pterin cofactor. The mechanism leading to NO formation is complicated and the design of selective inhibitors rests, in part, on mechanism. Our studies to date have involved various aspects of structure and catalysis, and future investigations will continue to explore these areas.</p><p>Soluble Guanylate Cyclase. NO activation of sGC and the mechanism to turn the enzyme off are key questions under study. The heme moiety on sGC is an excellent trap for NO because nitrosyl-heme complexes form rapidly. However, it is not obvious how catalytic activity and the resulting signal (cGMP) would be turned off, given that nitrosyl-heme complexes are generally very stable. Our work to date, mainly via spectroscopic methods, has shown that the heme in sGC is unlike any characterized previously and is finely tuned to interact with NO in a way that allows for transient signaling via transient activation of the enzyme. We are working toward a detailed understanding of this control because therein lies the crucial pharmacology. Structural studies in collaboration with the Kuriyan group are underway. Tolerance to nitrovasodilator drugs such as nitro- glycerin is clinically very important. We are exploring the hypothesis that tolerance is brought about by desensitation of sGC to NO.</p><p>Novel Heme-based Sensors. Sequence analyses have led to hypothesis that heme-based sensors related to that in sGC are present in prokaryotic biology. These sensors have evolved to be specific for NO and in some cases oxygen.  We are exploring the molecular basis for this ligand discrimination. Biochemical and structural studies are underway, the latter in collaboration with the Kuriyan lab.</p><p>Malaria Biochemistry. In our search for novel metabolic pathways and reactions in the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we are exploring heme metabolism the parasite , specifically looking at the histidine-rich proteins as a novel class of heme-binding proteins.</p>"

S"<p>The long-term goal of our research is to understand the structural and dynamic information encoded in the linear sequence of amino acids. Proteins undergo an incredible transformation from one-dimensional sequence information into complex three-dimensional shapes that carry out intricate cellular functions. We still, however, don't have enough biophysical knowledge to translate this sequence information into functional insights. For instance, many proteins share the same native structure yet their cellular dynamics and function, in other words their energy landscapes, are different. Our laboratory uses a combination of biophysical, structural and computational techniques to understand these features.</p><p> In addition to the native conformation, a protein sequence populates small fluctuations around the native state, partially unfolded forms and even the globally unfolded conformation. Such non-native states on the energy landscape are thought to play a determining function in many cellular processes such as translocation, protein synthesis, degradation, signaling and allostery. They are also prone to aggregation, a phenomena which has been implicated for many diseases (the so-called misfolding and amyloid diseases). Understanding the sequence determinants of the energy landscape is therefore fundamental to the biological process that proteins carry out as well as protein folding itself.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Our group has developed and utilized several methodologies that allow us to probe the energy landscape. Our use of different hydrogen exchange methods to study three different types of intermediates of E. coli ribonuclease H (the acid molten globule, the higher energy conformations of the native state and a kinetic folding intermediate) has been particularly powerful. We have obtained evidence for a surprising conclusion: RNase H folds in an apparently hierarchical fashion in which the most stable individual element folds first. This hypothesis unites a lot of work in the field of and has also provided insight and experimental tests for current theoretical work on protein folding.</p><p> We have extended our analysis to investigate the energy landscape of thermophilic proteins. Proteins from thermophilic organisms must retain their native structures under extreme conditions, where their homologues from mesophilic organisms denature. We have found that although protein stability can be altered by single amino acid substitution, evolution for optimal function requires more subtle and delocalized mechanisms.Recent results implicate structure in the unfolded state as playing an important and novel role for the thermostability of these proteins.</p><p> Proteolytic susceptibility is another important feature determined by the energy landscape. We have taken a proteomic and biophysical approach to understand how a protein fine-tunes its landscape to control this feature.</p><p> Other projects in the lab focus on the mechanism of protein misfolding, the structural and energetic mechanism of signaling, computational identification of folding modules, and the role of ligand binding. Our studies on the mechanism of folding include investigating the role of topological complexity using permuted proteins, the nature and function of folding intermediates, and studies on the role of mechanical unfolding using single molecule measurements.</p><p><i> Structure/FunctionStudies on RNase H:</i> RNase H is an essential activity for retroviral life cycle. It is an excellent, yet underexploited target for antiretroviral therapy. With the long-term goal of rational inhibition, we are using our biophysical background and knowledge of the folding of this protein to understand its structure/function relationship.</p>"

S'<p>My main research interest at present is in the spectroscopy of one- and two-electron ions at very high atomic number. This research is conducted mainly at accelerators located in Europe (GANIL accelerator in Caen, France and the SIS accelerator in Darmstadt, Germany). In this work, the beam-foil method is used to strip the very-high energy ions emerging from the accelerator (34.5 GeV Au from the SIS accelerator) to the hydrogenic and helium-like charge states. Measurements are then made of the life times of the excited atomic states to test predictions of the various theories. Measurements have recently shown that nuclear spin effects can cause the lifetimes of the same atomic state to differ by an order of magnitude or more in different isotopes of the same element. Another project concerns the measurement of the hyperfine structure of the n=1 ground state of hydrogenic ions at very high-Z. </p><p><b>Current Projects </b></p><p>I am currently organizing an experiment at the SIS accelerator in Darmstadt to make lifetime measurements in heliumlike Au and U (Au77+ and U90+). The goal of these experiments is to obtain accurate values for the fine-structure separation and the Lamb shift in the n=2 state of these ions. Even for this seemingly simple 3-body system, accurate calculation has proven difficult because relativistic and radiative corrections are so large. Hence accurate experiments are needed to test the calculations. Another goal of this experiment is to observe for the first time, a rare two-photon (M1)(E1) decay mode predicted for the decay of the 23P0 state of two-electron uranium. </p><p>Another project with which I have involvement is the measurement of the hyperfine structure of the ground state of hydrogenic bismuth (Bi80+). This experiment will involve laser spectroscopy of trapped ions and will be conducted at the EBIT facility at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. </p>'

S'<p>We are interested in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and motility, and in the mechanisms that couple these pathways to the cell division cycle. In particular we are interested in the signaling pathways responsible for malignant transformation by viral and cellular oncoproteins, and how the pathways involved in malignant transformation are related to those that regulate the behavior of normal cells. Our work focuses on two types of oncoprotein. One class, the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is typified by Src, originally identified as the product of the retroviral v-src oncogene. The other class is typified by Ras, a small GTP-binding regulatory protein that is frequently mutated in human cancers. Both types of protein are components of signaling complexes that are assembled at the inner face of the plasma membrane and that regulate complex signaling cascades.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The role of the small GTPase Rho in cell invasion induced by oncogenic Src. Oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts by activated Src results in dramatic changes in morphology, characterized by disruption of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers and formation of invasive adhesions termed podosomes or invadopodia. Since the small GTPase Rho stimulates stress fiber formation, Rho inactivation has been thought to be necessary for morphological transformation. However, we have recently shown that active Rho is localized to podosomes induced by oncogenic Src and is required for their assembly and function. Thus in Src-transformed cells localized activity of Rho is necessary for the assembly and function of structures implicated in tumor cell invasion. We are currently attempting to identify the Rho effectors that mediate cell invasion. </p><p>Changes in gene-expression induced by activated Src. Transformation of fibroblasts by oncogenic Src results in a novel pattern of gene expression and the activation of the cell-cycle machinery. We have shown that the ability of Src to induce cell proliferation is dependent on the transcription factor Myc, and that the Src-Myc pathway regulates cyclin E- and cyclin A-dependent kinases. We have also shown that Src phosphorylates an isoform of protein kinase C, resulting in its translocation into the nucleus, and are examining the effects of this translocation on gene expression. In addition, microarray analysis has identified a number of novel genes induced or repressed by activated Src, and we are examining the possible roles of these genes in mitogenic transformation.</p><p>The role of Src signaling in transformation of mammary epithelial cells. Normal mammary epithelial cells cultured in three-dimensional matrices form polarized structures resembling mammary acini, the secretory units of mammary gland. Under the same conditions, breast cancer cells show unrestricted growth and form disorganized clusters. We have observed that pharmacological inhibition of Src causes certain malignant mammary carcinoma cells to exit the cell cycle and form acinus-like structures. Since the level and activity of Src are frequently significantly elevated in breast cancer cells, these observations suggest that Src may be involved in breast cancer progression. We are currently investigating the role of Src signaling pathways, such as the Src-Rho and Src-Myc pathways described above, in the transformation of mammary epithelial cells.</p>'

S"<p>To date, my published work has focused on the relationships between music and politics: the place of music in political institutions, the role of music in the public sphere, and the ways in which music constructs identity and subjectivity - as well as issues of appropriation, subversion, musical trashiness, and political kitsch.  My book, <i>Political Beethoven</i>, re-examines the politically charged rhetoric and cultural contexts of Beethoven's music and its later reception.  I am co-editor (with W.

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The Mathies group uses modern laser spectroscopic techniques including resonance Raman spectroscopy, time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy, and femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy to study chemical and biological reaction dynamics with a particular focus on the mechanism of photoactive proteins that mediate information and energy transduction. Also, new high-sensitivity, laser-based detection techniques are used to facilitate the development of high-performance microfabricated chemical and biochemical analysis methods and &amp;quot;lab-on-a-chip&amp;quot; apparatus for genomic sequencing, genotyping, forensic identification and pathogen detection. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Excited-State Structure and Reaction Dynamics. The quantitative analysis of resonance Raman vibrational scattering intensities is a powerful method for obtaining information on the excited-state structure and femtosecond reaction dynamics of photoactive molecules. This technique is being used to study polyenes, retinals and retinal-containing pigments, as well as the structure of the solvated electron. We are also developing the new time resolved vibrational structural technique called Femtosecond Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy that provides high resolution vibrational spectra of transient reaction intermediates with sub-100 fs time resolution. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Photoactive Proteins. Visual excitation begins when a photon is absorbed by the 11-cis retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin. The photoisomerization of retinal to the all-trans configuration drives conformational changes in the surrounding protein that excite the retinal rod cell. We are using a variety of low-temperature and ps-fs time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to determine how the excited-state isomerization occurs, how the protein catalyzes this process, how chromophore isomerization drives subsequent activating protein conformational changes on the ps-ns time scale, and how the protein controls the wavelength of maximum absorbance of visual pigments. We are also interested in understanding the photochemical mechanism of other light-sensing proteins such as phytochrome (a light sensor in plants), bacteriorhodopsin (a light-driven proton pump found in halophilic bacteria). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Microfabricated DNA Analysis Systems. Laser-excited fluorescence is a sensitive detection method that lies at the heart of our work in bioanalytical chemistry. High sensitivity detection coupled with new fluorescent labels that exploit fluorescence resonance energy transfer has facilitated the development of high performance microfabricated chemical and biochemical analysis systems. Photolithographic methods are used to micromachine capillary electrophoresis systems and integrate them with DNA sample preparation microreactors. These novel devices provide ultra-high throughput sequencing for genomics, genotyping for health care diagnostics, and portable devices for point-of-care analyses, forensics, biothreat detection and space exploration. The overall goal is to develop chemical and biochemical microprocessors that will revolutionize chemical and biochemical analysis. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

She is also collaborating with two other specialists of modern Russian culture at three US universities in developing a web-based research and pedagogical tool on The International Legacy of Russian Modernism (1890s - 1920s).  In conjuction with this ongoing digital project, she is working  with a group of graduate students at UC Berkeley in designing a web-based cultural map of  Petersburg. Besides  well-known historical and cultural sites, the map will allow users to navigate the industrial sites of the city and those associated with everyday life, such as the pathways taken by cattle from the city\'s ports and train stations to the slaugherhouses, and then to the shops and restaurants; or the early tram lines established through the city at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>'

S'<p>Phylogenetics is the common thread connecting all aspects of my research program. My primary interest is in the use of phylogenetic analysis and comparative methods to address evolutionary questions related to functional morphology, life history evolution, and historical biogeography. I also have an interest in theoretical aspects of phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods and their application to molecular and morphological data. My current research is focused primarily on Southeast Asian flying lizards (genus Draco) and hummingbirds. My ongoing work with flying lizards includes <b>(1)</b> an investigation of scaling relationships and their influence on the evolution of gliding performance, <b>(2)</b> phylogeography/ biogeography of the Wallacean radiation of flying lizards, and <b>(3)</b> population genetics of multiple species contact zones on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. My work with hummingbirds (a collaborative effort with D. Altshuler and R. Dudley) investigates the evolution of flight performance, with special emphasis placed on understanding how morphology and performance scale with one another and elevation. Comparative flight performance and morphological data will be analyzed in the context of a species-level phylogenetic estimate that we are currently generating for the 330+ species of hummingbirds.</p><p> Much of my research is dependent upon fieldwork and I maintain an active field program in Southeast Asia. The herpetofauna of Southeast Asia is among the least known and most endangered on the planet and I plan to direct most of my field efforts toward this region for the foreseeable future. Although students with interests close to my own (both conceptually and geographically) are welcome in my lab, I encourage my students to develop independent research programs. </p><p></p>'

S'<p>Much of my research focuses on the theory of physical processes in the interstellar medium, the diffuse gas between the stars. How do stars form out of this tenuous gas, and what effect do the stars have back on the interstellar medium. Jerry Ostriker and I developed the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, which has been widely used to organize and interpret observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. With my colleagues and students, I have worked on the theory of the evaporation of clouds by both hot gas and ionizing radiation, the evolution of supernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles, the structure and emission spectrum of interstellar shocks, the evolution of interstellar dust grains, the structure of molecular clouds, and the theory of photoionization-regulated star formation. Some of my research has focussed on active galactic nuclei, particularly the study of reverberation mapping and of Compton-heated coronae and winds above accretion disks. Richard Klein and I have established the Berkeley Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics Group to develop the technique of adaptive mesh refinement for numerical simulations of astrophysical fluid dynamics.</p>'

S'<p>Broadly, my research interests lie at the interface of culture, social cognition, and intergroup processes. More specifically, I draw from an interactionist, Person-by-Situation (P x S) perspective (see Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2002) to understand how marginalization of one\'s social group affects basic processes related to social identity and intergroup relationships.</p><p>My recent collaborative research outlines a theoretical model of the psychological processes that mediate the behavior of members of stigmatized groups as they interact with majority group members and pursue their goals in major social institutions. According to this model, people who anxiously expect status-based rejection may be predisposed to readily perceive and intensely react to such rejection. These processes can lead to insecurity about one\'s place in historically exclusionary social institutions, affecting social identity in ways that undermine one\'s achievement and the quality of one\'s social relationships. Given the enduring nature of race as a source of stigma in the United States, my first step in this research program was to test the implications of race-based rejection sensitivity (RS-race) for African American students making the transition to a predominantly White college (Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002).</p><p>Four principal goals guide my current and future research in this area. The first goal is to corroborate previous findings with laboratory studies of the physiological, affective, and behavioral impact of RS-race on how minority students cope in situations likely to activate their race-based rejection concerns. The second goal is to assess the generalizability of the RS-race model to other low-status groups. Latinos and African Americans in the U.S., for example, might be expected to share similar race-based rejection concerns due to the common negative treatment and marginalization that both groups experience. The third goal is to examine the moderating effect of majority group members\' own attitudes and beliefs, including their own rejection concerns, on the quality of intergroup interactions. A fourth and final goal is to identify contextual (e.g., institutional support systems) and personal (e.g., coping strategies) factors that can reduce the anxiety and apprehension associated with RS-race.</p><p>In line with the fourth goal above, my second, related research program examines psychological mechanisms that may facilitate adaptive coping in the face of stressful events. In particular, I have been interested in the implications of alternative ways of encoding the self for affect regulation and social information processing (Mendoza-Denton et al., 2001). Consistent with prior correlational research, we have shown in a series of experiments that encoding the self in unconditional trait terms (e.g., "I\'m a failure") can amplify depressive responses to stressful experiences. Conversely, Person-by-Situation (P x S) self-encoding that highlights the interaction between behavior and the conditions to which it is bound (e.g., "I\'m a failure when I wait until the last minute to study") helps attenuate the tendency to catastrophize failures-and to glorify successes-- beyond the contexts to which they apply. These results provide initial evidence supporting a causal effect of interactionist self-encoding on reduced affective extremity, perhaps leading to enhanced social and emotional competence.</p><p>Currently, I am examining whether interactionist self-encoding is effective among people who are particularly vulnerable to negative affect in a given domain. Research on RS-race, for example, shows that high RS-race students experience greater interpersonal and academic stress during the transition to college. One research direction will test whether P x S self-encoding can help high RS-race individuals regulate negative arousal in situations that activate anxious expectations of race-based rejection. In another direction, we are exploring whether encoding outgroup members\' behavior in P X S terms (i.e., "They are ____ when ____") fosters more complex social information processing, leading to less global, unconditional impressions of outgroup members in intergroup interactions.</p>'

S'<p>Our research addresses basic aspects of chromosome dynamics and developmental biology: how chromosomes fold and align to achieve proper segregation; how gene expression is coordinately regulated across the entire X chromosome; how choices are made between alternative cell fates; how regulatory gene hierarchies specify sexual fate. Our studies of X-chromosome-wide gene expression through the process of dosage compensation have revealed a mechanistic link between higher-order chromatin structure and chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis. These studies have led to an analysis of chromosome structure and crossover control during meiosis and macromolecular structures called kinetochores that attach and move chromosomes within the spindle during chromosome segregation. </p><p><b><i>Current Projects</i></b></p><p> Counting X chromosomes and autosomes to determine sex. In numerous organisms, the decision to become male or female is made by an X-chromosome counting mechanism that reliably distinguishes one X chromosome from two. We have used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect such a precise chromosome counting mechanism in molecular detail. In this nematode, the two-fold difference in X-chromosome dose between males (XO) and hermaphrodites (XX) is translated into the non-linear response of the target gene xol-1 (XO lethal), a switch that specifies male fate when active and hermaphrodite fate when inactive. Setting xol-1 expression is essential for viability as well as sex determination because xol-1 also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. Five X-linked genes called X-signal elements communicate X-chromosome dose by controlling the activity of xol-1, using a combination of at least two mechanisms. One involves transcriptional repression of xol-1 in XX embryos and requires an X-signal element that encodes a nuclear hormone receptor. A second involves the post-transcriptional regulation of xol-1 and requires an X-signal element that encodes an RNA binding protein. This protein represses xol-1 by preventing the RNA processing event that generates the functional xol-1 transcript. Both the transcriptional and RNA processing mechanisms of repression act together to ensure the fidelity of the X-chromosome counting process. Sex is not determined simply by X-chromosome number, but rather by the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes. We have shown that the autosomal signal is composed of autosomal signal element genes, one of which encodes a T-box class of transcription factors and the other encodes a protein with glutamine and asparagine-rich repeats, zinc fingers, and a metalloprotease domain. How these autosomal signals are integrated and functionally oppose the X signals to regulate sexual fate is a focus of future studies. Efforts are also directed toward defining other X and autosomal signal element  genes. </p><p> Dosage Compensation and Chromosome Segregation. In flies, worms and mammals, specialized dosage compensation complexes are targeted exclusively to the X chromosomes of one sex to modulate transcript levels by altering chromosome architecture. By studying dosage compensation, we expect to discover how the expression state of an entire chromosome can be established and maintained. We have shown that dosage compensation is achieved in C. elegans by a complex of at least ten proteins that assembles on both hermaphrodite X chromosomes around the 40-cell stage of embryogenesis to reduce transcript levels by half. Although dosage compensation is a sex-specific process, the nematode dosage compensation complex contains both dosage compensation-specific proteins and general chromatin-associated proteins that are also active in meiosis or mitosis in both sexes. These proteins are similar to components of the mitotic chromosome condensation and segregation machinery (the 13S condensin complex) discovered in yeast and frogs, implying the evolutionary recruitment of ancient mitotic proteins to the regulation of gene expression. The multifunctional members of the dosage compensation complex are differentially commissioned for their roles in dosage compensation or chromosome segregation by their association with different protein partners. The protein complexes specialized for dosage compensation, mitosis, and meiosis are under analysis, along with their mechanisms of action. </p><p> Targeting the Dosage Compensation Complex to X Chromosomes. The dosage compensation complex (DCC) is recruited to X chromosomes by two hermaphrodite-specific genes (sdc-2 and sdc-3) that coordinately control both sex determination and dosage compensation. SDC-2 is central to X-chromosome recognition and confers both X-chromosome specificity and hermaphrodite-specificity to dosage compensation. The biochemistry underlying the function of SDC-2 is currently under investigation. While many components of the DCC have been identified, the cis-acting chromosomal elements that distinguish X chromosomes from autosomes to recruit the complex have been elusive until recently. To define these X-recognition elements (rex sites), we performed an X-chromosome-wide screen to identify regions of X sufficient to recruit the complex when detached from X. We found non-overlapping X regions that strongly recruit the DCC in vivo and other X regions that recruit the complex weakly or not at all, despite having genes know to be dosage compensated on the native X. The DCC normally binds the entire length of the wild-type X chromosome, including regions unable to recruit the complex when detached from X. Thus in worms, as in mammals, the DCC spreads into regions distant from initial recruitment sites. We have identified nine discrete X-recognition elements, and shown that nematodes use these cis-acting sites to recruit the DCC and nucleate spreading to neighboring stretches of X lacking recognition elements. This recruitment and spreading establishes the global, epigenetic regulation of X chromosomes that is maintained throughout the lifetime of the animal. Current projects define more precisely the mechanism of DCC spreading and the sequence or structure of rex sites responsible for differentiating X chromosomes from autosomes to recruit the DCC. </p><p>Regulation of Meiotic Crossover Interference in C. elegans. In most organisms, homologous chromosomes must undergo at least one crossover to guarantee proper segregation during meiosis. The number and distribution of crossovers is controlled through the process of crossover interference. In C. elegans, crossover interference is extremely tight, such that only one crossover event occurs per homologous chromosome pair per meiosis. Our recent experiments indicate that the dosage compensation protein DPY-28, a homolog of the 13S condensin subunit XCAP-D2, is important for this regulation of crossovers. Mutations in dpy-28 disrupt interference, causing double and triple crossovers per homolog pair and a skewing of the crossover distribution. The mechanism of crossover interference and its relationship to chromatin structure is under investigation. </p>'

S"<p>Professor Miller's research deals with essentially all aspects of chemical dynamics, especially the theory of chemical reactions and reaction rates, as well as other dynamical phenomena such as photodissociation, femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, etc.  The goal is to be able to describe these dynamical processes at the same level of molecular detail as one can the static/structural properties of molecules.  Effort is focused on developing new theoretical methods and models, and also on the application of these approaches to specific problems of chemical interest. </p><p> For small (3 or 4 atom) molecular systems it is possible to carry out essentially exact quantum mechanical scattering calculations, and indeed a great deal of success has been achieved in recent years in calculating state-to-state reactive scattering cross sections.  This provides the most complete characterization of a chemical reaction allowed by the basic laws of nature.  Even more exciting, however, has been the development of ways to calculate more averaged properties of a chemical reaction, e.g., its thermally averaged rate constant, \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., without inherent approximation.  This is not only an interesting intellectual development, but it provides improved ways to carry out practical calculations of rate constants for chemical reactions. </p><p> To treat more complex molecular systems Prof. Miller's group is pursuing use of the semiclassical (SC) initial value representation (IVR) as an approximate way to include quantum effects into classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations.  CMD can be applied nowadays to a wide variety of complex molecular phenomena \xe2\x80&#148; chemical reactions in liquids, in clusters, in biomolecular environments, on surfaces \xe2\x80&#148; but it is based totally on classical mechanics to describe the motion of the nuclei.  (Electrons, of course, are treated quantum mechanically and produce the effective potential function that governs nuclear motion.)  Semiclassical theory is capable of describing all types of quantum effects \xe2\x80&#148; interference/coherence, tunneling, vibrational zero point energy, effects of identical particle symmetry \xe2\x80&#148; and the IVR is potentially a practical way of implementing SC theory for truly complex molecular systems.  A variety of new advances have recently been made that significantly enhance the practicality of the SC-IVR approach, and calculations have been carried out for a number of chemical problems that demonstrate its wide applicability; these include vibrational tunneling splitting in van der Waals complexes, photodissociation of ozone, femtosecond photodetachment of I2-, molecular energy transfer, proton transfer in 7-azaindole dimers, electronically non-adiabatic processes, and flux correlation functions for chemical reactions. </p>"

S'<p>The focus of my research group is the biological control of insect pests and theecology of insect parasitism and predation. Classical biological control has anoutstanding history of success in the sustained regional control of invading pestsand provides exciting opportunities for both lab and field-based ecologicalresearch. However, not all biological control introductions result in spectacularreductions of pest damage and so a major emphasis in our work is to address arguablyone of the most challenging questions in biological control research: what are thedeterminants of success in classical biological control? In addition to classicalbiological control, the augmentation of natural enemy populations is an aspect ofbiological control that is rapidly gaining attention. The use of natural enemies asbiological pesticides raises some very interesting questions about the performancecharacteristics of natural enemies, strategies for release and optimization ofimpact. </p><p>Natural enemies, and in particular insect parasitoids, are known not only for theirimportance in biological control but also as model systems for the analysis of manyexciting questions in biology. As a result, our research interests include a varietyof aspects of natural enemy biology, from behavior and evolutionary biology topopulation and community ecology through observational, experimental and comparativeanalysis. One of the most satisfying aspects of our work is the knowledge that thediscovery of exciting new elements of natural enemy biology provides a directlinkage to the implementation of improved biological control and a reduced relianceon pesticide intervention in insect pest management. </p><p><i><b>Current Projects</b></i>, Biology of Insect Parasitoids and Predators. The lifetime reproductive success of afemale natural enemy is dependent on her ability to locate hosts, to assess thequality of each host, and to respond to variation in encounter rates and hostquality. Thus parasitoids and predators are ideal model organisms for the study ofbehavioral ecology \xe2\x80&#147; how behavioral decisions influence the fitness or reproductivesuccess of an organism. Current projects focus on dispersal, functional andnumerical responses, population structure and hybridization, and a demographicapproach to evaluating the compatibility of natural enemies with pesticides. We arecurrently working with Aphidius transcaspicus, Chrysoperla carnea, Harmoniaaxyridis, Mastrus ridibundus, Trioxys pallidus, Trichogramma species, and Venturiacanescens. </p><p>Dynamics of Biological Control Systems. Ecologists have not been slow to addressbiological control through ecological theory and the development of conceptualmodels to capture the essence of host-parasitoid interactions. The differencebetween success and failure in biological control can be due to exogenouslimitations or to endogenous processes. We focus on the latter to find more generalaspects of the interaction between natural enemies and hosts that can be used toimprove success and minimize the risks of biological control. Current projects usesimple models to examine the interplay of host population growth rate, host refugesfrom parasitism, parasitoid fecundity, and generation time ratios in the dynamics ofhost-parasitoid systems. </p><p>Implementation of Biological Control. We currently have three biological controlprojects in our laboratory, one on the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) a notoriousfruit-borer that is the key pest of apple, pear and walnut production; a second onthe mealy plum aphid (Hyalopterus pruni) a key pest of prunes; and a third on walnutaphid (Chromaphis juglandicola) a well-known pest of walnuts. The first two projectsinvolve foreign exploration, selection of natural enemies for importation, and fieldrelease and monitoring. The third project is designed to elucidate reasons for thelocalized failure of sustained biological control 35 years after the successfulintroduction of the parasitoid Trioxys pallidus. </p>'

S'<p>David Milnes presently serves as music director of the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra and conductor of the Berkeley Contemporary Chamber Players. He is also Music Director of the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, one of America\'s largest and most active ensembles dedicated to championing the music of our time. Following early musical studies on the clarinet, piano, organ, cello and voice, he earned degrees from SUNY Stony Book and Yale University His conducting teachers have included Leonard Bernstein, Erich Leinsdorf, Max Rudolf, Herbert Blomstedt and Otto-Werner Mueller.</p><p>After winning the prestigious Exxon Conductor position with the San Francisco Symphony in 1984, David Milnes was hailed as "one of the major new conducting talents of our day." (Byron Belt). In San Francisco his award-winning educational programs resulted in a nationally televised broadcast of a Concerts for Kids documentary; he also conducted subscription, contemporary and pops concerts. On twenty four hours notice he was called to step in for an ailing Edo de Waart, conducting a national broadcast of Elgar\'s Violin Concerto with Pinchas Zukerman as soloist. He served also as Music Director of the acclaimed San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra, which he led on an international tour during which he was awarded the Prize of the City of Vienna for his performance of Bartok\'s Concerto for Orchestra.</p><p>David Milnes is a frequent guest conductor in Russia and the Baltics. He has appeared with the Novosibirsk Philharmonic and served as a principal guest conductor of the Latvian National Symphony, where he led a Wagner program featuring tenor John David DeHaan, an all-Berlioz program that Berlioz himself conducted in Riga, and a special performance of Steve Reich\'s The Desert Music that was attended by the President of Latvia and the American ambassador. Other recent collaborations have included performances with Dawn Upshaw, Bill T. Jones, Paul Hillier, James Newton and David Starobin. A dedicated proponent of new music, Milnes received a 1994 Grammy nomination for his recording of John Anthony Lennon\'s Zingari, and has recently recorded an album of music by James Newton with the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players.</p><p>As Music Director of the Riga Independent Opera Company as well as the opera and orchestral programs at SUNY Purchase and Southern Methodist University, his varied operatic repertoire has included productions of Die Fledermaus, Eugene Onegin, Die Zauberfl\xc3\xb6te, Le Nozze di Figaro, La Boh\xc3\xa8me, The Consul, Gianni Schicchi, Suor Angelica and The Threepenny Opera, among others. Opera News wrote of his 1997 performances of Mozart\'s Idomeneo at The Curtis Institute of Music: "Shaping a persuasive interpretation notable for its drive and drama, conductor David Milnes drew superb playing from the Curtis Institute Orchestra" His Sondheim revue program aired nationally on A&amp;E in 1995.</p><p>Milnes has recently conducted the Oregon, Columbus, Anchorage and Cheyenne Symphonies, and has performed at the Tanglewood, Aspen, Monadnock and Killington Music Festivals. He has guest conducted and lectured at the Juilliard, Curtis and Mannes Schools as well as at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He has also had a lifelong interest in jazz which has led to appearances with Gene Krupa, Chuck Mangione, Billy Taylor and John Pizzarelli.</p>'

Main areas of interest include a long-term study of interactions (genetic, physiological, behavioral) between a wild primate, the mantled howler monkey, and its host-specific parasite, the howler monkey botfly, in Panama.  Data suggest that this parasite may contribute heavily to howler mortality, impacting particularly on immature individuals.  Human dietary behavior is also of interest, particularly the question of just what type of diet may be best for modern human health and longevity.  This work  includes the comparative study of diet and activity in a number of indigenous groups in the Brazilian Amazon.   Interests pursued by graduate students in my lab include modeling of the  movements and food location strategies of wild howler monkey troops in Panama and studies of  the quality and anti-quality components of wild plant parts in Suriname and Uganda, and  their physiological effects on resident primate groups.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'As a researcher, he explores how educational policies form institutional structures that in turn shape teaching and learning in schools. He is particularly interested in the tension between student achievement and citizenship, accountability and democratization. He examined these relationships, first, in East German schools that underwent fundamental changes after the collapse of socialism. , , In recent years, Dr. Mintrop has turned to the issue of school accountability, particularly in low performing schools.'

S'<p>Research in design, behavior, and analysis of reinforced building, bridge, and lifelines construction includes studies in materials, components, and complete structural systems. Materials studies have included normal- and high-strength concretes;effects of materials aging and materials deterioration on component properties; bond between concrete and steel reinforcement, and use of headed reinforcement. Studies on components and structural systems include beam-column joints, spirally-reinforced ductile bridge columns, shear strength of concrete columns, slab-column framing, three-dimensional effects due to the contributions of slabs to frame response,three-dimensional response of reinforced concrete wall and frame systems, and design of highrise buildings. Research includes analytical work, small-to-large-scale laboratory experiments, and post-earthquake studies.  In the area of seismic evaluation and rehabilitation, studies have been carried out on capacities of older existing construction including columns, beam-column joints (bridges and buildings), and slab-column framing. Seismic rehabilitation of columns, joints, and slabs using concrete and steel jackets, and post-earthquake evaluation and repair of columns, joints, slab-column connections, and walls are topics of previous study and continuing interest. An area of current interest relates to understanding collapse of building frames under combined gravity and seismic loading and improving evaluation methods through that understanding. Research interests extend to include performance-based earthquake engineering. Current research aims to quantify earthquake risk and to express it in ways that are useful to decision-makers who must determine courses of action for addressing seismic risk. Study aspects include characterization of seismic hazard especially considering fault rupture and ground shaking; geotechnical earthquake engineering including site response and ground failure; response of soil-foundation-structure-nonstructural systems; identification of engineering damage parameters; and translation of damage parameters to decision variables that are quantified for use in decision-making by various stakeholders.</p><p>Dr. Moehle has served as a consultant or participant on a range of  professional engineering and code and guidelines development projects. He currently is chair of the seismic subcommittee of the American Concrete Institute Building Code. With the Applied Technology Council he has participated in guideline development projects including projects leading to publication of ATC 32 (Improved Seismic Design Criteria for California Bridges: Provisional Recommendations), FEMA 306 (Evaluation and repair of earthquake damaged concrete and masonry wall buildings), FEMA 356 (Prestandard and Commentary on the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings - now ASCE 41), FEMA 440 (Evaluation and Improvement of Inelastic Seismic Analysis Procedures).

S'<p>My work focuses on power, spatiality, and race. I have conducted over 30 months of ethnographic fieldwork on agrarian micro-politics in Eastern Zimbabwe. This work explores the cultural politics of landscape and identity, focusing on both colonial and postcolonial governmentality, those assemblages of practice that promote self-disciplining subjects. I use both historical and ethnographic prisms to examine racialized regimes of rule in southern Africa, notably conflicts over land, labor, and livelihood. This ethnographic work on <i>situated struggles</i>tries to bring a more enlivened spatial sensitivity to contemporary anthropological formulations of the cultural politics of place, power, and identity. A brief period of field research in South Africa focused on post-apartheid land claims and the cultural politics of recognition and redistribution.</p><p>More recent work maps an emergent field of the cultural politics of race and nature. How do race and nature work as contested terrains of power? Drawing from Race Critical Theory, postcolonial theory, and the field of environmental politics, this project tracks the traffic between nature and culture that routes through historically specific formations of racism. Part of this work resulted in a collaborative project that produced the co-edited Race, Nature, and the Politics of Difference (Duke, 2003).</p><p>On campus, I am one of the core faculty members in the interdisciplinary Environmental Politics initiative, housed within the Institute of International Studies. I remain actively involved in African Studies; in the African Diaspora Program (within African-American Studies); and with the Graduate Group in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. Inside the department, my research and teaching interests include: governmentality; cultural politics; spatiality and power; environment and development; race and the politics of difference; and postcolonial theory. I am currently on the editorial boards of Cultural Anthropology and Society and Space, a journal of Critical Human Geography.</p>'

S'<p>Condensed matter theory. My main interest is in the properties of "strongly correlated" materials and devices in which electron-electron interactions yield new states of matter. The zero-temperature phase transitions between correlated quantum states are an especially beautiful and universal part of this field. Another exciting area with potential technological relevance is how correlated quantum states decohere in an active environment. Theoretical work on these problems benefits from an increasing quantity and quality of experimental data, and students in the group are encouraged to interact with experimental efforts at Berkeley and elsewhere.&gt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Current Projects</b>&gt;/p&gt;</p><p>Interaction effects in nanoscale devices: The effects of electron-electron interactions become especially dramatic when electrons are confined in quantum dots (zero-dimensional systems), nanotubes or quantum wires (one-dimensional), or quantum wells (two-dimensional). Experimentalists are now creating a wide variety of tiny devices and in many cases accessing regimes where a weakly interacting description misses essential physics. In many such problems, a few localized quantum variables, such as a single spin or the electrons on a superconducting grain, interact with a "sea" of surrounding electrons or phonons which can fundamentally modify the dynamics of the localized degrees of freedom. As an example, in the Kondo effect an unpaired spin forms a complex correlated ground state with the surrounding electrons, and experimentalists can now observe and control this behavior in single atoms and in quantum dots. Much of the current experimental and theoretical interest in such problems is driven by the hope of being able to control the interactions between several localized degrees of freedom and thereby perform logical operations on quantum states.&gt;/p&gt;</p><p>Quantum phase transitions: Another current research topic is the theory of disorder-driven quantum phase transitions, such as superconductor-insulator and Hall transitions: these show universal scaling laws but are not nearly as well understood as their classical analogues. There is a highly successful theory of classical phase transitions which also describes a few quantum phase transitions, but not those of the greatest experimental importance. There are also some complex and poorly understood materials such as the cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion compounds which seem experimentally to show quantum phase transitions. We do have a theoretical framework for some experimentally relevant quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional systems. For an example, see the classification paper listed below on quantum Hall edges, which discusses the surprising variety of phases and transitions in a relatively simple one-dimensional problem. Many open problems remain in higher dimensions, and some promising leads have appeared in the last few years.&gt;/p&gt;</p><p>Other topics in condensed matter theory: Although recently the above projects have taken up most of my time, there are many other areas in which similar analytical and computational techniques can be applied. Two of my physics "hobbies" are the physics of percolation and polymers, and applications of statistical physics to information theory and computing. Students are welcome to drop by and discuss specific problems in which they have an interest, or condensed matter theory in general.</p>'

S'<p>Professor Mora\xe2\x80\x99s research focuses mainly on questions of racial and ethnic categorization, organizations, and culture. Her dissertation, De Muchos, Uno: the Institutionalization of Latino Panethnicity, won the 2010 ASA Distinguished Dissertation Award, and provides a socio-historical account of the emergence and diffusion of a \xe2\x80\x9cHispanic/Latino\xe2\x80\x9d panethnic category in the United States. She is currently developing this project into a book manuscript, and plans to use some of the insight gleaned on racial/ethnic classification to shed new light on the production of medical and scientific knowledge. In addition, Professor Mora\xe2\x80\x99s research on culture focuses on immigrant religion, as well as on the diffusion of Pentecostalism in Latin America.</p>'

S'<p>Atomic nuclei are samples of quantum Fermi fluids. Their size classifies them as mesoscopic systems, whose properties are intermediate between quantum mechanical microscopy and quantum, or classical bulk behavior. The Moretto group has developed a nuclear mesoscopic thermodynamics and have applied it to the interpretation of nuclear reactions in a variety of regimes. For instance, they have predicted, and experimentally found the disappearance of strong quantum structures with increasing excitation energy. Very recently by means of strong scaling techniques they have visualized the presence of temperature dependent shell effects and nuclear superconductivity in the energy dependence of fission probabilities.</p><p>The same insight has led them to the prediction and experimental verification of statistical emission of complex fragments (of mass greater then an alpha particle) from excited nuclei. They have tracked this process of fragment emission up to very high energies, where several fragments can be emitted in a single reaction event. This reaction is called multifragmentation.</p>p&gt;Quantum fluidodynamics has allowed the prediction that multifragmentation may occur through the development of surface instabilities of the Rayleigh kind in peculiar nuclear shapes like disks, tori, and bubbles. In particular the group has discovered a hitherto unknown instability (sheet instability) which manifests itself when two interfaces are closer then the force range. This instability is of a very general nature, and may play an important role on the long term stability of modern layered semiconductor materials.<p>The Moretto group has also developed new powerful methods for the interpretation of very complex nuclear reactions. These methods have led them to discover very general properties associated with multifragmentation, like "reducibility" and "thermal scaling". For instance, the probability of emitting n fragments can be "reduced" to the probability of emitting a single fragment through a special combinatorial law (binomial). In turn, the one fragment probability yields a linear Arrhenius plot, indicating the thermal scaling characteristic of a Boltzman factor.</p><p>Similarly, they have discovered a reducibility equation for the fragment size distributions, which permits to express the n fragment distribution in terms of the one fragment distribution. This equation contains an enthalpic term, associated with the energy necessary to produce a fragment, and an entropic term, which relates to the group properties of the fragmentation decay tree.</p><p>Monovariant and bivariant regions have been uncovered in this process, in which the fragmenting system behaves like a saturated or unsaturated vapor. While this approach has been applied so far only to "nuclear" multi- fragmentation, it is clear that it can be applied to a variety of multifragmenting systems, for example degraded polymers</p>'

The geographic focus of this research program spans the tropical forests of Australasia, especially the wet tropics of northeastern Australia, western North America and eastern South America. While I emphasize amphibians and reptiles as research organisms in their natural environments, I am not taxon bound and pursue research on organisms ranging from annelids and molluscs to all vertebrate groups. Much of my current research is devoted to exploring ways of combining information from surveys of molecular variation with data on demography and current or historical distributions in order to infer population processes in space and time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>Davitt Moroney was born in England in 1950. He studied organ and harpsichord with Susi Jeans, Kenneth Gilbert and Gustav Leonhardt, and musicology with Thurston Dart and Howard Mayer Brown. He entered the doctoral program at UC Berkeley in 1975, completing his Ph.D. in 1980. For 21 years he was based in Paris, working primarily as a freelance recitalist in many countries. He has made over 50 CDs, especially of music by J. S. Bach, William Byrd, and members of the Couperin dynasty. Many of these recordings feature historic 17th- and 18th-century organs and harpsichords.They include William Byrd\'s complete keyboard works,  the complete harpsichord and organ music of Louis Couperin, J. S. Bach\'s "The Well tempered Clavier", "French Suites", "Musical Offering", complete sonatas for flute and harpsichord, and for violin and harpsichord, as well as "The Art of Fugue" (a work he has recorded twice). He has also recorded a Froberger recital played on the oldest organ surviving in France (built by Robert Dallam in 1653) and the entire contents of Marc-Roger Normand Couperin\'s harpsichord manuscript. </p><p>His recordings have been awarded the French "Grand Prix du Disque" (1996), the German "Preis der Deutschen Schallplatenkritik" (2000), and three British "Gramophone Awards" (1986, 1991, 2000).  In 1987 he was named "Chevalier dans l\'Ordre du m\xc3\xa9rite culturel" by Prince Rainier of Monaco and, in 2000, "Officier des arts et des lettres" by the French government. In 2001, he returned to California to teach at UC Berkeley where he is Professor of Music and also University Organist. Among his many scholarly publications, his monograph "Bach, An Extraordinary Life" was published in 2000 and has since been translated into many languages.In 2005 he rediscovered Alessandro Striggio\'s masterpiece, the "Mass in 40 and 60 Parts," one of the greatest lost works of the Italian Renaissance. It had been composed in Florence for the Medici family but had last been seen in 1726. Following his identification of the work (which had been miscatalogued in the Biblioth\xc3\xa8que Nationale in Paris, without its title, and under an erroneous description and the name of a non existent composer), he conducted the first modern performance in London\'s Royal Albert Hall in July 2007, to a live audience of 7,500 people; the concert was also broadcast live to a radio audience of over seven million people, in six countries.  </p>'

S'<p>Our research interests focus on viscoelastic flows, rheology, and polymer dynamics. Broadly speaking, we are interested in how polymers behave in flows, especially in the complex flows typical of material processing operations. While simple molecular models may describe the behavior of a polymeric liquid in a rheometric experiment such as steady shear flow between parallel plates, calculations with these models generally fail to reproduce even the qualitative features of more complicated flows like extrusion and fiber- spinning. We use a variety of optical techniques including laser Doppler velocimetry, flow visualization, digital partical image velocimetry, and flow birefringence, along with rheometry, size exclusion chromatography, and light scattering. These tools allow us to study well-defined flows of well-characterized fluids and test quantitatively hydrodynamic calculations. By examining idealized problems, we hope to obtain an understanding of what elements in the constitutive models and calculations are essential for capturing the important physics in viscoelastic flows. Our aim is to obtain insights into the general mechanisms of instabilities and flow-induced demixing phenomena.</p>'

S'<p>I am working on particle physics, trying to understand the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces acting among them. The so-called "Standard Model" of particle physics is very successful, and the Higgs boson, which is the "core" of the Standard Model, is supposed to be discovered this decade. However, there are still many problems which remain unanswered even with a future discovery of the Higgs boson. Why are there so many "elementary" particles, repeating three generations which have identical properties except their masses? Why are there three (electromagnetic, weak and strong) forces acting on elementary particles in a seemingly random manner? Why does Higgs boson exist and play such a special role? Why is the Universe so long-lived and has more matter than anti-matter in it?</p><p>Recently, two important questions were added to the list. The Universe appears to be accelerating its expansion. Why? The neutrinos are supposed to be completely massless in the Standard Model, but recent indications of neutrino oscillations strongly suggest that they have small but finite masses. How?</p><p>These puzzling phenomena must be clues to what is really going on at the most fundamental level in Nature. Using these clues, studying them in detail and ask what is behind is the approach in most of my research.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling with the question how we can understand the small but finite value of the cosmological constant. One of the important question is the so-called "Why Now?" question, why we seem to live at the special moment in the history of Universe where the matter energy density is the same as that of the cosmological constant within a factor of two. Together with Nima Arkani-Hamed, Lawrence Hall, and our former postodoc Chris Kolda, we pointed out that there is a triple coincidence of energy densities including the radiation. Such a coincidence must have an explanation. We further pointed out that, if the cosmological constant is tied to the scale of electroweak physics as TeV2/MPl, the triple coincidence is an inevitable consequence, explaining "Why Now." I believe this sheds important light on the origin of cosmological constant. The way the electroweak scale and cosmological constant are connected remains to be a major puzzle. Another important question is if the acceleration of Universe is really due to the cosmological constant. Together with my ex-student Alex Friedland and our postdoc Maxim Perelstein, I study if alternative forms of Dark Energy are consistent with cosmological observations and particle-physics constraints. </p><p>Neutrino oscillations had been studied over many decades, but my ex-students Andr\xc3\xa9 de Gouv\xc3\xaaa, Alexander Friedland and I had found that past analyses of data covered only a half of the parameter space ("the light side"). The other half ("the dark side") can actually explain the current data on solar neutrinos, and had been completely missed in the literature. I continue active studies on how we attack the problems of neutrino masses. For example, Lawerence Hall, his student Neal Weiner, and I pointed out that a near-maximal mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillation, often regarded as the most puzzling feature, may well be a consequence of randomness in parameters. We called it "anarchy." My current student Aaron Pierce and I showed how near future neutrino experiments can pin down on oscillation parameters. The future in this area appears very bright. The origin of small neutrino masses may well be connected to the question why there appears to be only matter but no anti-matter in Universe. Most explanations to the current puzzles require physics at much shorter distance scales than the electroweak scale 10\xe2\x80&#147;16 cm, possibly the Planck scale 10-\xe2\x80&#147;33 cm. Na\xc3\xafve estimates of quantum corrections suggest such a hierarchy in distance scales is unstable. Supersymmetry is probably the most promising way to stabilize the hierarchy. The mechanism of supersymmetry breaking has consequences on collider experiments to string theory. Gian Giudice, Markus Luty, I, and Riccardo Rattazzi had found a contribution to supersymmetry breaking from subtle quantum effects called anomalies, overlooked for two decades. These contributions revive some of the past unsuccessful attempts in model building, and pause new questions. </p>'

S'Ramona Naddaff is currently researching a book on censorship and the novel in 19th and 20th-century France, England and the United States. Her forthcoming study, "Exiling the Poets: The Production of Censorship in Plato\'s Republic" (University of Chicago, Fall 2002) examines the relation, forged through the mechanism of censorship, between philosophy and literature. Drawing on this work, she is examining western philosophical and literary theories of lying from Plato to Derrida. She is also co-director and editor of Zone Books, a non-profit publishing house in New York.'

This work reflects a theoretical perspective that crosses disciplinary boundaries. <i>Essays in Controlling Processees</i> (1994, 1996, 2002) is ongoing work that attempts to synthesize contemporary work on power and control.

S'<p>The Napoli lab focuses on regulation of the molecular events that control retinol(vitamin A) homeostasis, especially activation of retinol into atRA(all-trans-retinoic acid). Retinol supports a wide range of biological actionsessential for vision, development, normal cell proliferation, differentiation,reproduction, the immune response, and nervous system development, maturation andfunction.  For example, low retinol status impairs short-term memory formationthrough hindering hippocampus long-term potentiation and long-term depression.Retinol does not function directly; rather it serves as metabolic precursor foratRA, the retinoid that effects the systemic (non-visual) actions attributed tovitamin A.  atRA controls the differentiation status of multiple cell types, andregulates gene expression in differentiated cells, including genes crucial tospermatogenesis, hematopoiesus, nerve plasticity, estrus, placental development,embryogenesis, and apoptosis. atRA also serves as a tumor suppressor. Biosynthesisand catabolism control atRA concentrations in temporally-spatially precise patternsto impose specificity on the pleiotropic, systemic actions of retinol. The Napolilab uses techniques of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology and analyticalbiochemistry (hplc, LC/MS) to determine the precise paths of retinol activation,their regulation, and their relationship to aging and disease. </p>'

His first book project, Orphans of Petrarch, traced the impact of the imitation of Petrarch and other Italian poets, on poetry and poetic theory in Spain from Juan del Encina through Quevedo, focusing on Bosc\xc3\xa1n, Garcilaso, Herrera, and G\xc3\xb3ngora. In the course of this period, the Petrarchan theme of unrequited love acquires a metaliterary dimension, standing for the ever-elusive goal of poetic priority and national cultural legitimacy. He continues to write about poetry and poetics, including, for example, recent articles on S\xc3\xa1 de Miranda, Diogo Bernardes, and on Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. Moreover, he has recently begun a new project, on the impact of printing on narrative culture c. 1500. This project cuts across a number of narrative genres, including hagiography, chivalric biography, balladry, and the sentimental novel, and also considers contemporary historiography as a narrative form.</p>"

S'<p>For most of my professional career, I have studied small group decision making with an emphasis on the ways in which such decisions can be made better, more correct and more creative. Our emphasis has been on influence processes in general and the value of dissent, in particular, as we have repeated evidence that dissent, even when it is wrong, stimulates divergent thinking, a consideration of more alternatives, and ultimately serves the detection of truths and the finding of creative solutions.</p><p>Our research, while both experimental and naturalistic, concentrates on basic cognitive and influence processes. However, we have also applied this knowledge, primarily to law and to business. Our work relevant to law is primarily on jury decision making and the reader is referred to Jury Trials:  Psychology and the Law published in the Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (ed L. Berkowitz), 1981,14 ,pp 309-367., Other publications, including a comparative analysis of France vs the United States, can be found in the curriculum vitae. I have also consulted extensively on jury trials and was the first woman and the first social scientist to give an invited address to the Oregon Bar Assn.</p><p>The research pertinent to business has focused not only on the quality of decision making and teams but has also focused on corporate cultures that foster innovation. The Reader is referred to Managing Innovation: When Less is More published in the California Management Review (Fall 1997) and available on this website. I have given invited addresses to the Business Schools/Schools of Management at Yale, Harvard, Northwestern, Cornell, Berkeley, London, Aston (Birmingham) and St. Petersburg, Russia. I am the recipient of the prestigious Leverhulme Fellowship, and was a visiting professor at London Business School for 4 years. I served  as the Chair of the Board of Advisors to the Institute of Innovation, Management and Organization at the Haas school of Business at UC Berkeley for 5 years. I have given numerous modules in Executive Education at London Business School and at the Haas School at UC Berkeley, mostly on the topics of judgment and decision making, team decision making, principles of persuasion, creative thought and on corporate cultures for innovation.</p><p>My interests in creativity and innovation are both experimental and naturalistic. The experimental work has been on individual and group decision making and the naturalistic work has been primarily interviews of eminent Nobel Prize winning scientists.</p><p>Related work has focused on harnessing the benefits of diversity of team members, techniques for raising the level of creativity (e.g. brainstorming), power (its uses and abuses) and persuasive tactics. We also concern ourselves with cross cultural differences, both in the interpretation and process by which people make good and creative decisions.</p><p>For more information: <a href="http://charlannemeth.com/" target="_blank">CharlanNemeth.com</a></p>'

S'<p>Our research focuses on three areas in chemical dynamics and spectroscopy: (i) studies of reaction dynamics through a combination of transition state spectroscopy with state-resolved photodissociation experiments on stable molecules and reactive free radicals, (ii) size-dependent spectroscopy and dynamics of semiconductor clusters, and (iii) the effect of clustering and solvation on fundamental chemical processes. Novel experiments involving photodetachment of negative ion beams have been developed to address several of these issues. For example, the transition state spectroscopy of isolated reactions and reactions in clusters is studied by photodetachment and photoelectron spectroscopy of solvated transition state precursor anions. Femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of negative ions is used to probe the effects of clustering on photodissociation and vibrational relaxation dynamics. We also perform experiments on neutral beams, and have recently set up an experiment in which the spectroscopy and dynamics of Rydberg states in doped helium nanodroplets is investigated with photoionization and photoelectron spectroscopy. </p>'

S'<p>How does the olfactory apparatus of vertebrates detect and discriminate thousands of odors? Our approach to elucidating the mechanisms of olfactory discrimination involves the characterization of odorant receptors and the neural pathways that they activate. We are also interested in the developmental mechanisms responsible for specifying odorant receptor expression in olfactory neurons and the pathfinding of these cells\' axons to their appropriate targets. Finally, our lab is developing DNA microarray technologies to elucidate genome-wide patterns of gene expression in the nervous system.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>The zebrafish olfactory system.</i> The numerical and anatomical simplicity of the zebrafish olfactory system facilitates an analysis of the molecular and cellular basis of olfactory coding in a vertebrate species. In one line of investigation, we are defining the odorant-binding properties of cloned fish odorant receptors, as fish respond to water soluble cues that are more amenable as probes for biochemical analyses. The zebrafish also offers advantages for studying development; methods for the generation and screening of mutant zebrafish may permit genetic approaches for studying odorant receptor gene expression and olfactory neurogenesis. Genomic mapping of odorant receptor genes and reveals that, as in other vertebrate species, odorant receptor genes are clustered in the zebrafish genome. However, genes tightly linked within a cluster are not coordinately regulated, suggesting that the regulation of individual receptor genes require the interaction of specific trans-acting factors with proximal cis-regulatory sequences. We are pursuing a variety of approaches, including transgenic manipulations, to define the promoter sequences responsible for directing the developmentally-regulated expression of the odorant receptor genes. </p><p><i>Patterning in the olfactory bulb. </i>Olfactory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge with great precision to a small number of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. This suggests that spatial patterns of afferent innervation in the bulb are used to encode olfactory information. What are the mechanisms for specifying the pattern of olfactory neuron projections in the olfactory bulb? We are pursuing several complementary approaches to identify the molecules involved in olfactory axon pathfinding. Transgenic manipulations in the mouse and zebrafish are being used to assess the potential role of candidate genes in the formation of the olfactory sensory map. We are also utilizing DNA microarrays to search for molecules expressedin spatially-restricted patterns in the olfactory bulb; such molecules would be good candidates as guidance cues for ingrowing olfactory axons. </p><p><i>DNA microarrays.</i> Recent advances, which include the sequencing of entire genomes of selected model systems and the ability to survey "genome-wide" patterns of gene expression, now allow the dissection of biological processes at unprecedented levels of detail. We have established in our laboratory the full capabilities for carrying out DNA microarray analysis of gene expression. These techniques allow the analysis of mRNA expression from tens of thousands of genes at a time. To date, we have created high-density cDNA microarrays from the mouse and the zebrafish. We are using these microarrays as tools to investigate patterns of developmentally-regulated and spatially-restricted patterns of gene expression in the vertebrate central nervous system.</p><p>Our research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of cellular differentiation in the nervous system.  To this end, we are developing and applying DNA microarray-based approaches to identify \xe2\x80&#147; on a genome-wide level \xe2\x80&#147; the genes and genetic programs that underlie the progression of cells from the undifferentiated stem cell to the mature cell state.  The information gained from these studies will be used to interpret and guide future studies on the development of neuronal precursors and mature neurons from human embryonic stem cells.  In addition, the expertise of the Functional Genomics Laboratory in DNA microarray approaches and statistical analysis of large-scale gene expression datasets will be made available to all investigators on campus studying human stem cell biology.</p>'

S'<p>My research interests in recent years have been directed at elucidating the causes of growth impairment in catabolic states, such as occurs in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Lack of insulin reduces the secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) by the liver, and this effect is associated with reduced hepatic responsiveness to growth hormone (GH). In addition, insulin deficiency reduces the production of IGF-I and GH. Diabetic animals also show striking changes in their plasma levels of various IGF-binding proteins (IGF-BPs). These changes in the IGF-BPs also contribute to the reduced growth in insulin deficiencies. Another factor that is responsible for the reduced growth is activation of the adrenal cortex, with consequent hypersecretion of glucocorticoids. These adrenal steroids interfere with the actions of insulin, IGF-I, and GH at the cellular level in catabolic states.</p><p> Another area of interest involves analysis of relationships among the various hormones that function in the reproductive cycles of women and other mammals, including non-human primates.</p>'

S'<p>We are interested in the biochemical and molecular genetic analysis of thestructure and functions of bacterial membranes. Topics currently pursued include thespecific and non-specific channel-forming proteins of the outer membrane, thediffusion of lipophilic compounds (inhibitors and antibiotics) across the unusuallyimpermeable bilayer domain of the outer membrane, as well as the mechanism andregulation of multidrug efflux transport systems that pump out an incredibly widerange of compounds from bacterial cells. We are also studying the structure andfunctions of mycobacterial cell wall, which makes these bacteria intrinsicallyresistant to most drugs because it acts as an exceptionally efficient permeabilitybarrier.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The most fundamental function of biological membrane is to serve as a generalpermeation barrier and at the same time to allow the selective permeation of certaintypes of molecules. We are trying to understand the molecular mechanisms underlyingthis function by using several systems.</p><p> All Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, produce an extra membranelayer, called outer membrane, which is located outside the cytoplasmic membrane andthe peptidoglycan (cell wall) layer. This is an ideal model for studies of thistype, because sources of energy are not available at this location, and thereforethe membrane allows only the passive and facilitated diffusion processes. In thissystem, we discovered one of the first examples of the proteins forming non-specificdiffusion channels, and named it "porin." This was followed by our identification ofthe phage lambda receptor protein as the protein that produces channels specific formaltose and maltodextrins. We are studying the structure-function relationships inthese channel-forming proteins by a variety of approaches. We believe these studiesare of potential significance, not only because these channels can serve as modelsfor other channels with more complex functions, but also because, from the practicalpoint of view, most antibiotics have to pass through these outer membrane channelsin order to be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. </p><p>Another example of an effective permeability barrier on cell surface is the cellwall of mycobacteria. We discovered that this is a bilayer of very unusualcomposition, with the parallel arrangement of extremely long fatty acid chainsproducing a structure of exceptionally low fluidity, which prevents the rapid influxof antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents and thus contributes to the intrinsicresistance of these bacteria. </p><p>We became aware, however, during the course of these studies that permeabilitybarriers by themselves are not sufficient to produce high levels of drug resistance.Search for additional mechanisms led to the discovery that most bacteria produceactive efflux pumps that display extremely wide range of substrate specificity, arange that had not been suspected to exist earlier. For example, the AcrAB effluxpump of E. coli pumps out not only dyes and detergents but also practically allcommercially important classes of antibiotics, with the sole exception ofaminoglycosides, and in addition, even simple solvent molecules.</p><p> Furthermore, most Gram-negative pumps can excrete drugs directly into the externalmedia, bypassing the outer membrane barrier: thus the slow entry of drugs throughthe outer membrane acts synergistically with the direct efflux process, to preventthe intracellular accumulation of noxious compounds. We are actively studying themolecular mechanisms of these fascinating transporters, as well as theirphysiological and genetic regulation. The most exciting news is that we haveelucidated the structure of the pump with bound drug molecules in a collaborativework with the laboratory of Prof. D. E. Koshland, Jr. We found that thesubstrate-binding site is a vast cavity with a diameter of 35 angstroms, and thatthe wide substrate specificity is the result of drug binding that involves not onlyamino acid residues of the protein but also phospholipids within the cavity. Thisfinding is likely to have implications in the mechanism of other multidrug effluxpumps, for example P-glycoprotein that pumps out anticancer drugs out of the cancercells of patients, diminishing the efficacy of chemotherapy.</p>'

We are advancing the molecular understanding of actinide sorption by studying the behavior of the actinides uranium, neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium on environmentally relevant solid substrates using modern spectroscopic techniques to explore the existence of complexes postulated by surface complexation modeling.  Knowledge of the actinide speciation in solution is a prerequisite for the sorption studies. Besides conventional speciation techniques (potentiometric titration, spectrophotometry, solvent extraction, etc.), we use more sensitive laser-induced fluorescence and photoacoustic spectroscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to provide molecular-level structural information of solids, solutions, and solution/solids interfaces.</p><p><b> Microbial Actinide Interaction</b>: Microbes in soil, sediment, and water can have a significant influence on the environmental actinide mobility. We are studying the interaction of actinides with aerobic and anaerobic common soil bacteria to elucidate the binding mechanisms and electron-transfer processes.  Actinides may be stabilized or precipitated by enzymatic, direct or indirect microbial action. The chemical form of the actinide, the presence of electron acceptors and donors, and the environmental conditions play an important role on the type, rate and magnitude of microbial activity. Redox conditions also influence the solubility of actinides. Enzymatic reduction from a higher to a lower less soluble oxidation state can occur.  Microbes can produce extra-cellular chelating agents in response to low availability of soluble iron.  A better understanding of these processes will provide the basis for applying microorganisms for biostabilization and bioremediation of actinide-contaminated environments.</p><p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Production, Chemistry, and Nuclear Properties of the Heaviest Elements</span></b></p><p>The heaviest elements are synthesized at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\'s (LBNL) 88-inch Cyclotron using the compound nucleus Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS).

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our lab is dedicated to gaining mechanistic insight into crucial molecular processes in the life of the eukaryotic cell. Our two main research themes are the dynamic self-assembly of cytoskeleton during its essential functions in cell division, and the molecular machines governing the flow of genetic information, from DNA replication to RNA transcription, translation, processing and degradation. The unifying principle in our work is the emphasis on studying macromolecular assemblies as whole units of molecular function by direct visualization of their architecture, functional states and regulatory interactions. With this overall aim in mind we use electron microscopy and image analysis, complemented with biochemical and biophysical assays, towards a molecular understanding of our systems of interest. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Current Projects&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Microtubule Structure and Dynamics.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Microtubules are essential cytoskeletal polymers involved in processes as diverse as intracellular traffic and cell division. A long-standing interest of my lab concerns the process of microtubule dynamic instability and its role in mitosis. The dynamic behavior of microtubules is essential to their functions, as underlined by the large number of compounds that bind tubulin, alter dynamics and result in mitotic arrest. A growing number of cellular factors regulate this dynamic behavior during the cell cycle. Interestingly, dynamic instability is an instrinsic property of tubulin that can be observed in purified solutions and is linked to the binding and hydrolysis of GTP. Our studies of tubulin bound to taxol in polymerized, straight protofilaments, obtained by electron crystallography established the structural basis of nucleotide exchange and polymerization-coupled hydrolysis. We also obtained two structures corresponding to the start and end points in the polymerization and nucleotide hydrolysis cycles that illustrate the conformational consequences of the nucleotide state and how they relate to longitudinal and lateral assembly. Our study supports the separation of the straightening process that accompanies tubulin assembly into two stages: one, nucleotide-dependent, that allows for lateral association into a curved sheet, and a later one that occurs upon microtubule closure. In the past five years our microtubule cytoskeleton studies moved from a tubulin-centric view of the mitotic process, to one that emphasizes the dynamic interactions of microtubule ends with cellular factors, specially those involved in chromosome capture, alignment and segregation. Such factors, by interacting with the dynamic ends of microtubules, are able to modify the behavior of these polymers and to make use of the unique structures at microtubule ends to localize in space and time. Most importantly, some of them are able harvest the energy of the nucleotide-coupled assembly and disassembly processes to carry out cellular work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Microtubule-Kinetochore Interactions.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; In collaboration with the Drubin and Barnes labs we are studying the yeast Dam1 kinetochore complex (also known as DASH). We showed that this ten-subunit complex assembled into rings around microtubules that can move processively with microtubule ends,  thus coupling microtubule depolymerization to directional movement. We have now produced the only existing structures of the Dam1 complex, both unassembled and assembled around microtubules, and described a conformational change that links the interaction with tubulin to the process of ring formation. Our future aims are to define the role of the subunits in self-assembly and microtubule interaction and to obtain a structure at subnanometer resolution of the assembled ring. Ultimately we would like to understand the bases for the regulated function of the Dam1 complex in mitotic progression and response to the spindle check point.The Dam1 ring is a beautiful solution to the problem of maintaining attachment to a microtubule depolymerizing end and coupling disassembly to processive movement of chromosomes. However the Dam1 complex has not been found outside of fungi, and it is known to be essential only in budding yeast, where the engagement of a single microtubule per kinetochore puts strong pressure on a highly processive molecular attachment. Our interest in the essential process of chromosome segregation has thus led us to extend our work to the study of the highly conserved KMN kinetochore network. In the last two years we have made excellent progress on the characterization of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex, the microtubule interacting component of the KMN. We have directly visualized the architecture of the full-length yeast Ndc80 complex by negative stain EM and found a dramatic kink within the 560 \xc3\x83\xe2\x80\xa6 coiled-coil rod located about 160 \xc3\x83\xe2\x80\xa6 from the larger globular head. Comparison of our EM images to the structure of the globular domains of the human Ndc80 complex allowed us to position the kink proximal to the microtubule-binding end and to define the conformational range of the complex. The position of the kink coincides with a coil-coiled breaking region conserved across eukaryotes.  We propose that the kink in Ndc80 is essential for correct kinetochore geometry and hypothesize that it could be part of a tension sensing mechanisms at the kinetochore. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Nucleic Acid Transactions .&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Electron microscopy is ideally suited to the study of self-assembly processes. But this methodology has also proven to be an excellent complement to X-ray crystallography in the study of large macromolecular complexes.  During the last five years we have teamed up with a number of collaborators in the study of molecular machines dedicated to nucleic acid information flow, with special emphasis on the mechanism of gene regulation. The regulated transcription of genes in all eukaryotes requires the assembly of a complex molecular machine. That includes TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and RNA pol II. Cofactor complexes that mediate the interaction of the general machinery with sequence-specific activators and protein complexes involved in the remodeling of chromatin are additional elements leading to transcription regulation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our goal is to characterize the structural bases for the mechanism of action of these different factors, as well as their interaction in the context of an integrated model of transcriptional regulation. We have obtained a 3-D model of TFIID and the TFIID-A-B complex to about 30 \xc3\xaf\xc2\xbf\xc2\xbd resolution. Our main effort is now moving to the study of whole preinitiation complexes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>My research area is particle physics theory. I am interested in exploring physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. This area of research has been tremendously enriched in the past few years. Recent theoretical developments allow us to consider a variety of new possibilities for physics at the TeV scale, where the greatest mystery of the standard model \xe2\x80&#148; the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking \xe2\x80&#148; will be answered. My recent research has been focused on developing new ideas and building realistic models in particle physics, addressing several mysteries of the standard model. Now is a particularly exciting time to do these explorations, because theoretical considerations suggest that there must be new physics at the TeV scale \xe2\x80&#148; the energy region that will experimentally be probed within the next several years. It is also interesting that this new physics could well be a surprising one such as supersymmetry and hidden extra spatial dimensions.</p><p>Current projects:</p><p>My recent work has concentrated on the physics of extra dimensions. Extra dimensional theories can have several remarkable features useful in building realistic models of particle physics. These features mainly arise from locality in the extra spatial dimensions. For instance, with the extra dimension of the TeV size, we can construct a new theory of supersymmetric standard model in which the breaking of supersymmetry is non-local and the masses of all the superparticles as well as the Higgs boson are predicted. I continue to study this class of theories and its phenomenology.</p><p>I have introduced a new framework for unified theories in which the unified gauge symmetry is introduced in higher dimensions but is explicitly reduced to smaller groups at boundaries of higher dimensional space. This class of theories leads to completely realistic unified theories which allow precise predictions of the weak mixing angle at low energies and solve various problems in the conventional four-dimensional grand unified theories. I am interested in studying the physics of flavor in this framework, such as bi-maximal structure for neutrino mixing.</p><p>The extra dimensional spacetime can have non-zero curvature if there are energy densities distributed in the extra dimension. Such a spacetime, called warped space, can cause various interesting new phenomena at the TeV scale. I have constructed a realistic model of unification in warped space. This model predicts a plethora of new particles at the TeV scale, including grand unified particles, N=2 superpartners and their Kaluza-Klein excitations. Warped space also allows a possibility of eliminating the Higgs boson entirely from the theory. I have recently constructed a model of this kind.</p>'

S'<p>My earlier research focused on the physiology and biochemistry of environmental  stresses associated with water, mineral nutrients, salinity, and toxic heavy metals.   Since 1990 my research has focused on phytoremediation, the use of plants to clean  up contaminated soil and water. My research approach is multidisciplinary in that my  laboratory conducts research in ecology, plant physiology and biochemistry,  microbiology, and molecular biology. My major accomplishments include development of  the use of constructed wetlands to remove selenium and toxic heavy metals from  agricultural and industrial wastewater, as well as the development of genetically  engineered plants for the phytoremediation of selenium- or heavy metal-contaminated  soils. Research in my laboratory now includes two new topics. The first is the study  of mechanisms of boron transport and hyperaccumulation in plants and bacteria. The  second is to rationalize the process of the production and development of drugs from  medicinal herbs.</p><p>With respect to teaching, I currently co-teach Plant Biology 135 (Physiological and  Biochemical Plant Biology, 3 units). This course, which is given in the Fall, is  designed for students majoring in plant biology and other students seriously  interested in plant physiology and biochemistry. In the Spring Semester of each year  I co-teach Plant Biology 180 (Environmental Plant Biology, 2 units).  This course  provides a multidisciplinary approach to the interactions of plants with their  environment. It integrates molecular, cell, organismal and whole plant aspects of  plant acclimation and adaptation mechanisms and examines the consequences of human  industrial activity on plant growth and productivity.</p>'

S"Dr. Nuru-Jeter's research interests are focused on the integration of social, demographic, and epidemiologic methods to examine racial inequalities in health as they exist across populations (e.g., SES groups), across place, and over the lifecourse; and to examine how health and social policies either exacerbate or mitigate race and socioeconomic health inequalities.  She is Co-Investigator of the Measures of Racism project (MORS) at UC San Francisco, a project focused on the development of a tool to measure racial discrimination for use in birth outcomes disparities research.  She has also worked on the effects of doctor-patient race concordance; the intersection of race, socioeconomic status (SES), and gender on risk for psychological distress; the intersection of race and SES on disability among older Americans; and on mortality among US adults; socioeconomic and racial differences in child health and development; racism, racial identity development, and reproductive health among Black women; income inequality, racial segregation and concentrated poverty on racial differences in mortality in the US; and the biological mediators of racism stress and poor birth outcomes."

S'<p>My research can be broadly situated in the fields of global and comparative environmental politics. I am interested in the ways different environmental political cultures produce differing policy outputs, and in how these subsequently affect and are affected by the international arena. My research so far has addressed the international trade in hazardous wastes,especially among OECD countries, developing an institutional theory of regulatory differences to explain why some countries (e.g. Britain, France) legally import more hazardous wastes than others (such as Germany, Australia and Japan). </p><p>The sorts of factors that I examine in the comparative context include: how and why relations among different stakeholders in environmental debates are shaped from country to country; how administrative structures and relations between national and sub-national governments affect policy; the changing roles and strategies of environmental movements in broader political contexts; and the factors driving environmental policy change in advanced industrialized countries (in particular focusing on ecological modernization theory). However, none of these factors can be viewed in isolation from the international, or transnational sphere of politics. Here, in addition to concerns about the formation and implementation of international environmental agreements, it is important to address the growing role of international actors, both governmental (such as the European Union and the UNEP) and non-governmental (e.g. NGO networks), and the increased importance of the globalized economy. </p><p><i><b>Current Projects:</b></i>, , 1. Further research on international hazardous and nuclear waste management and the waste trade, focusing on national constraints on waste management, extending analysis to the US and to emerging and transitional economies. I am also working on international cooperation over the management of spent nuclear reactor fuel. , , 2. The impact of the World Trade Organization on multilateral environmental agreements; normative change in international regulation and international cooperation; transnational protest movements , , 3.

S'<p>My specialty is algebraic geometry. This means, roughly, the study of the geometric properties of solutions of systems of algebraic equations. What I love about this subject is the interplay among geometry, algebra, analysis, and number theory. I am especially interested in applying differential and integral calculus in an algebraic setting. I am also involved in "logarithmic geoemetry," which is a systematic way of dealing with two important phenomena in mathematics: compactification and degeneration. Currently I am studying various aspects of algebraic differential equations, especially differential equations modulo p and differential equations with log poles.</p>'

Metallic and ceramic components of the core must operate in an environment that combines high temperatures, intense radiation fields, and corrosive chemical species. The nuclear materials research program at Berkeley is concerned principally with the chemical and physical behavior of the fuel and the cladding under these conditions. The experiments are intended to provide insight into the mechanisms of the phenomena involved, since fundamental understanding is ultimately useful in technological design. The research utilizes a variety of high-temperature furnaces and in-situ microbalances for continuously recording reaction rates.</p>'

S'<p>In our research group we use light (or electromagnetic radiation to we physicists) to probe condensed matter systems. We measure quantities like transmission and reflection coefficients, and nonlinear optical properties as well. For different experiments, we use light waves whose wavelength varies from the millimeter range to less than 0.5 micron. At this time we are studying high-Tc superconductors organic molecular crystals.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Currently, we are obtaining exciting new results on the dynamics of current carrying excitations (or quasiparticles) in high-Tc superconductors such as copper-oxides and organic molecular crystals. The idea of these experiments is to use a laser pulse to generate a nonequilibrium population of quasiparticles. Another pulse, delayed by a controlled amount with respect to the first, measures the optical absorption spectrum of the particles photogenerated by the first pulse. From such time-resolved spectroscopy experiments we learn important information about the recombination and scattering rates of quasiparticles. With this information we hope to understand the origin of superconductivity in these amazing materials.</p><p>Many of these results are obtained using a time-domain terahertz (TD-THz) spectrometer to measure the absorption of quasiparticles in the frequency regime that is commensurate with their scattering rates. This instrument allows us to generate and detect short pulses of terahertz radiation. The spectrometer is based on sources and detectors that are fabricated by the students in our group and a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser bought at the local laser store. </p><p>Briefly, the spectrometer works like this: both source and detector consist of a bit of silicon that bridges a gap between two metal strips. The Si becomes a conductor for 1 ps when illuminated with a sub-picosecond optical pulse from the laser. To generate terahertz waves we apply a voltage bias across the metal strips. When the Si is turned on by the laser, the resulting current pulse radiates an electric field into free space. (The same trick worked for Heinrich Hertz about 100 years ago except that he produced meter rather than millimeter-sized waves). We use curved mirrors to route the terahertz waves through a sample and onto the detector. The detector consists of the same device, with one important difference. Instead of applying a voltage bias we insert a current meter into the circuit. Now, the voltage bias is applied by the terahertz pulse incident from free space, which is of course rapidly varying with time. When the Si is turned on by a second laser pulse, the current meter output reflects the instantaneous value of the incoming field. By continuously varying the time-delay between the two laser pulses, the entire terahertz waveform is recovered.</p><p>Just to give an idea of what students have done recently in the group: one investigated the properties of high-Tc superconductors in a magnetic (B) field. Applying a B field to a Type II superconductor generates vortices or "superconducting hurricanes." The swirling current is carried by Cooper pairs, the bound pairs of electrons that condense to create the superconducting state. Near the "eye," or core of each vortex is a region where the velocity is so high that pairs break up into individual electrons, called "quasiparticles."</p><p>In our experiments we measured the extra absorption of terahertz waves caused by the quasiparticles carried by each vortex. Because in conventional superconductors (the ones before the high-Tc materials came along) the quasiparticles are localized in the core, their number per vortex is independent of the inter-vortex separation. Our group predicted that if the high-Tc superconductors have a gap function with d rather than s-wave symmetry, as suggested by many recent experiments, the quasiparticle density will depend very strongly on the inter-vortex separation. As a result, we predicted that the terahertz absorption should be proportional to the square root of the applied B field, rather than simply linear as in all previously studied materials. We have recently confirmed this prediction in the BSCCO high-Tc material, which leads to all sorts of exciting possibilities for future experiments.</p><p>Although our group began by specializing in terahertz spectroscopy, we are branching into non-linear optics in the visible and near UV regions. Recently, scientists at Lucent found that injecting quasiparticles into organic molecular crystals from a metallic contact caused them to superconduct at high temperatures. We are injecting carriers into the same materials using light. Who knows what exotic states may be created by high densities of electrons and holes introduced into these materials at low temperature. Things are still at any early stage and there is plenty to be done. Come and check these projects out for yourself!</p>'

S'<p>We would like to understand how information about the external world is encoded by the nervous system in the form of electrical signals and how those signals are processed and transmitted to the brain with minimal information loss. As a model system, the research in our laboratory makes use of the vertebrate retina. Retinal photoreceptors capture photons and use their energy to trigger the generation of a slow change in transmembrane voltage. That voltage signal is then transmitted synaptically to second- and third-order cells. In the course of transmission it is filtered, both spatially and temporally, and finally quantized by the ganglion cells into trains of action potentials which are conducted, via the optic nerve, to higher visual centers. Within this one piece of tissue, therefore, important mechanisms of energy transduction and information processing are available for study. Since the retina is a well defined and accessible piece of the brain, its study can provide models for similar processes occurring in the cortex and other areas of the CNS.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p>We have developed a comprehensive theory of retinal image processing and our present work makes use of a combination of modern electrophysiological techniques to test that theory as rigorously as possible, at all levels of the vertebrate retina. In the outer retina, we have found that the temporal filtering that occurs in rods and between rods and bipolar cells serves to minimize the expectable error in the temporal representation of natural images. We showed that the spatial organization of the receptive fields of retinal bipolar cells causes them to act as spatial bandpass filters tuned to a characteristic spatial frequency. The characteristics of these spatial filters allow natural images to be encoded with maximal fidelity and minimal redundancy. We are now studying how the properties of these spatial and temporal filters change when the retina is light-adapted.</p><p>In the inner retina, we are beginning to examine the temporal and spatial filtering that occurs between bipolar cells and ganglion cells and to explore the rules governing the quantization of signals by the ganglion cells. A multielectrode array, which allows us to record and analyze the simultaneous responses of many ganglion cells to complex images, provides a powerful tool with which to test many of the key predictions of our theory.</p>'

S'<p>Research Interests: </p><p>Condensed Matter Physics, Experimental Low Temperature Physics, Quantum Liquids. </p><p><b>Current Projects </b></p><p>Superfluid 3He weak links. Surface waves (third sound) in superfluid 3He. 4He quantum gyroscope. 4He phase slip sound. </p><p>In research in condensed matter physics, phenomena of interest are often masked by competing effects involving impurities,defects, temperature inhomogeneities, and thermal fluctuations. Liquid helium is the simplest condensed matter system. It exists at temperatures down to absolute zero, is extremely pure, defect free, and devoid of spatial variations in temperature. Because of the simple nature of this system, it can be thought of as "the hydrogen atom" of condensed matter physics. It is an ideal system to test fundamental physical concepts. </p><p>The most important aspect of the Helium liquids involves superfluidity. Liquid 4He is found to become a superfluid below 2.17K while 3He is found to change into a superfluid state below 2x10-3K. These discoveries have been honored by Nobel Prizes on 3 different occasions. The superfluid states themselves have been very important model systems to test and demonstrate physical theories. One recent example includes work in which aspects of the Big Bang model are tested by observing quantized vortices. Another recent experiment uses superfluids to test models of intrinsic nucleation of defects. </p><p>Our Low Temperature group studies both 3He (a Fermion system) and 4He (a Boson system) to test fundamental physical principles. We have cryostats which cool samples below 160\xc2\xb5K. At such low temperatures, we can measure mass currents as low as 5x10-14 gm/s, determine hydrostatic pressures as small as 10-10 atm, and measure displacement as small as 10-15m. We have also developed micro-fabrication techniques to build entire experiments on the micron scale. Our techniques have led to a substantial number of "firsts" including: photographing quantized vortex lines in 4He, demonstrating that fluid circulation is quantized in 3He, proving that Cooper pairing is responsible for superfluidity in 3He, developing a superfluid gyroscope to detect the Earth\xc3\xads motion, discovering the first superfluid 3He quantum weak links (Josephson junctions), and detecting superfluid surface waves in 2-dimensional 3He. </p><p>The group\xc3\xads present research is focused on phenomena which exploit the properties of 3He weak links, 4He phase slippage, and superfluid surface waves. The specific projects include: 1. The development of a superfluid dc-SQUID to detect absolute rotation. 2. A study of the intrinsic limitations of 4He phase slip rotation sensors. 3. An investigation of the properties of 2-dimensional Fermi superfluid. 4. A demonstration of the Josephson frequency relation in 4He. </p><p>A typical graduate student researcher in our group is involved with all aspects of his/her experiment, from the development of the experimental apparatus to the analysis and interpretation of the final data. Such training is designed to develop a well rounded scientist who has all the skills expected in an experimental physicist. </p><p>The group consists of 3-4 graduate students, one postdoctoral scientist and a technical assistant. We can accommodate one or two new graduate students in the group this year. </p>'

S'<p>My work falls into four general areas: (1) Origin of major evolutionary adaptations. Through a synthesis of phylogenetic, functional, and comparative morphological evidence, I try to assemble the best-supported evolutionary sequences available and to reconstruct the steps by which major adaptations, particularly flight, arise. (2) The beginning of the "Age of Dinosaurs." Although I work generally on Mesozoic vertebrate paleontology, I am most interested in the changes in the terrestrial vertebrate fauna that took place around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. (3) Systematics, functional morphology, and flight of pterosaurs. Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to gain powered flight, provide many interesting keys to the evolution of posture, locomotion, homeothemy, and vertebrate adaptation in the early Mesozoic Era. (4) Histology and constructional morphology of the bones of extinct reptiles. We study the microscopic structure of bones, and place our data in two contexts: phylogenetic (evolution of tissue types) and ontogenetic (development of tissue types with age). These two approaches, taken together, can provide the best picture of age, growth, and metabolism, and engineering design of bone. Our histology work is in conjunction with other researchers in California, Montana, and France.</p>'

More specifically, our research aims at a mechanistic understanding and quantitative characterization of biological processes and their impact on the mobility, bioavailability and distribution of nutrients, metals and contaminants. As a consequence, our research is strongly multidisciplinary, standing at the interface between soil microbiology, soil geochemistry and soil physics and explores the coupled geochemical, biological and transport processes in soils, surface sediments and within watersheds.  Our approach combines (i) field measurements, (ii) laboratory experiments that focus on the mechanisms, kinetics and equilibrium states of individual biogeochemical processes, (iii) reactive transport modeling, and (iv) elemental budget analysis at the field scale that ultimately allows predicting the response of a natural system to changing conditions.</p>'

My writing, teaching and research cover the following themes: narrative, trauma, psychoanalysis and the unconscious, memory, historicity and the hermeneutics of disjuncture, language and poetics, experimental ethnographic writing, anthropology and literature, dreaming and the anthropological study of the imagination, intercultural approaches to different ontologies and systems of knowledge, modernity, colonialism and postcolonialism, madness and mental illness.</p><p><i>Previous Research</i>A study of memory, trauma, and the speech of loss in a Southern Moroccan society, through spatial representation, autobiographical recollection, historical narrative, and oral poetry. (Based on in depth ethnographic study, including organization of space, agricultural practices, the body and techniques, the transmission of knowledge, idioms of gender and patriarchy) (See Impasse of the Angels. Scenes from a Moroccan Space of Memory,Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1997).</p><p><i>Current Research</i>A study of emergent forms of subjectivity in Moroccan modernity at the interface of "traditional therapies" and psychiatry/psychoanalysis, exploring theoretical ways to think existence, possibility and creation in a context of referential and institutional instability and in the aftermath of trauma. Based on ethnographic research on spirit possession and the "cures of the jinn", and on the experience of madness in a psychiatric hospital setting.

S'<i><b>Computational Plasticity</b></i>, This research focuses on finite element-based methods for the simulation of problems of infinitesimal and finite plasticity within the context of the strain-space formulation. Research in infinitesimal plasticity concentrates on issues of stability and accuracy of the algorithms used in the integration of the underlying differential/algebraic equations, as well as solveability issues concerning non-associative models. Research in finite plasticity concerns the derivation and numerical implementation of theoretically sound and physically plausible models for analysis of the elastic-plastic response of metallic bodies that undergo finite deformations. , , <i><b>Materials Modeling</b></i>, This research concerns the combined experimental, analytical and computational study of superelasticity in metal alloys, especially NiTi and CuZnAl. . , , <i><b>Contact/Impact for Finitely Deforming Solids</b></i>, This research concerns the development and analysis of finite element-based methods for the solution of contact/impact problems between bodies that may undergo large motions and deformations. Much of the work concentrates on formulations that employ Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraint(s) of impenetrability. Emphasis is placed on the development of methodologies that are rigorous, robust and suitable for large-scale computations. , , <i><b>Continuum Mechanics</b></i>, Various aspects of continuum mechanics are researched, especially in connection with problems of computational interest. Current specific interests include: development of fibrous solid models to analyze the mechanical response of penetration-resistant materials, such as Kevlar. , , <i><b>Dynamics of Pseudo-Rigid Bodies</b></i>, Research in the dynamics of coarsely deformable continua, such as pseudo-rigid bodies, is driven by the need to develop inexpensive, yet sufficiently accurate models of particulates that may undergo "long" motions involving boundary interaction (i.e., contact). Representative applications include the flow of rocks, sands, and aggregates, the dynamics of traffic accidents involving platoons of vehicles, etc.'

S'My research program centers on the study of the evolution of development mechanisms with a focus on the genes that regulate segmentation and regionalization of the body plan. We are particularly interested in understanding how certain steps in pattern formation that require protein diffusion in Drosophila are accomplished in those insects and crustaceans in which cellularization of the growing embryos would seem to preclude formation of gradients by diffusion. We have also begun to investigate the role of homeotic genes in generating body plan diversification in crustaceans and the role of stem cells in generating pattern during embryogenesis.  Another major area of research in the lab centers on investigating the function of the Drosophila segmentation genes during neuronal development and understanding how these genes may have contributed to the evolution of neural complexity.'

We are concerned primarily with the genetic structure of populations, the role of both historical and ecological parameters in determining this structuring, and the elucidation of evolutionary modes which result, as evidenced by morphology, genome structure and organization, molecular divergence, and historical biogeography. These approaches combine extensive field and laboratory phases of investigation. Current emphasis focuses on pocket gopher population dynamics in western North America, on the diversification of rodents and marsupials in Andean wet forests and the Amazonian rainforests, and on documenting historical shifts in the community structure of California mammals through re-surveys of sites throughout the state, but primarily in the Sierra Nevada, originally studied by Joseph Grinnell and his students in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in the early 1900s.</p>'

In this comparative study of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, my colleague at York University, Peter Vandergeest, and I are looking at the political economic influences on the formation of forest and land law during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We are focusing particularly on ways that customary rights and practices were integrated into or ignored in the subsequent laws, and whether changes in these laws have changed people's forest practices.Social and Environmental Change in Borneo. I have been conducting fieldwork in Indonesian and Malaysian Borneo since 1990, returning annually (approximately) to the same villages in West Kalimantan (Indonesia) and recently expanding to a village of similar ethnic composition on the Sarawak [Malaysia] side. By using oral histories, contemporary accounts and observations, and archival documents from the 19th and 20th centuries, I have been studying the production and transformation of anthropogenic forests in Borneo.Violence and the Rainforest. Communal violence broke out in the mid and late 1990s in those areas of West Kalimantan where I had been doing ethnographic and historical research.

S'<p>Measurements of low-temperature properties, primarily specific heat but also magnetic susceptibility and other properties, are compared with theory and model calculations to provide insight on the relation between macroscopic properties and microscopic structures.  Specific heat data are most useful for this purpose at low temperatures and most of the measurements are in the region between a few mK and 25 K.  For the recently discovered high-Tc superconductors and \xe2\x80\x9ccolossal magneto-resistance\xe2\x80\x9d manganites, measurements are being extended to higher temperatures, in some cases in collaboration with research groups in other laboratories.  Measurements can be made at high pressures and in high magnetic fields.  The systems currently under investigation include rare earth and actinide intermetallic compounds in which the conduction electron effective mass is several orders of magnitude higher than the free electron mass (\xe2\x80\x9cheavy fermion\xe2\x80\x9d compounds) manganites, and high-Tc superconductors. The current focus of measurements on the high-Tc superconductors is on phase transitions of the \xe2\x80\x9cvortex matter\xe2\x80\x9d in the vortex state.  Techniques are being developed for measurements on nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. </p>'

S"<p>My two most entertaining research projects right now are synthetic insects and  smart dust. The Smart Dust project is aimed at putting a complete sensing/communication  platform inside a cubic millimeter, including power supply, analog and digital  electronics, etc. Thousands or millions of these dust motes will all communicate  simultaneously. Applications are all over the map. Instrumented hospital rooms  so that your syringe knows if you're the right patient or not, instrumented bodies  so that we can all participate in 3D virtual ballet, instrumented atmosphere  so we can predict weather (did you see Twister? those sensors were way, WAY biggerthan they need to be). </p><p>,   The synthetic insect project is basically smart dust with legs. We're shooting    for millimeter scale legged locotion, or possibly flying. We're working with    people in biology who study insect walking, running, and flight (they've      got little force platforms and virtual reality setups for bugs - very cool).      In my    vision of the project, in a few years you'll be able to use a web-based cut-and-paste    design tool to select legs, motors, sensors, and electronics to design your      own custom insects, download control algorithms to them, and turn them      loose in a    3D interactive simulation to socialize or do battle with other virtual bugs.    Once you get the design you like, you press the button, it gets submitted      for fabrication, and two months later you've got the actual device (more      likely hundreds    of them) running around on your desk. </p>"

S'<p>The main theme of my research career has been the study of various kinds of stochastic processes, principally Markov processes, and the analysis of how the distributions of such processes are affected by various operations such as path transformations and conditionings. In recent years I have become interested in interfaces between this core of ideas and ideas in other areas of mathematics, especially combinatorics, special functions, and analytic number theory.</p><p> I have had a long and rewarding collaboration with Marc Yor of the University Paris VI. The principal object of our study has been the exact and asymptotic distributions of various functionals of Brownian motion and related processes such as Bessel processes. In recent years I have also been working on various random combinatorial objects, such as permutations, partitions, and trees, and how the asymptotic behaviour of such structures over a large set of elements can be described in probabilistic terms, often involving Brownian motion and related processes. This has led me to the study of various measure-valued and partition-valued Markov processes whose behaviour may be understood in terms of combinatorial constructions involving random trees. I am at present engaged in developing the circle of ideas related to random partitions, random trees, irreversible processes of coalescence, and their time reversals which provide models for random splitting or fragmentation. </p><p> I view this line of research largely as pure mathematics, but mathematics of a concrete kind which is often motivated and influenced by applications. Stochastic models with a natural probabilistic structure typically turn up in different disguises in diverse fields. The study of their mathematical structure allows ideas and results developed in one context to be transferred to another. Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be found in the course <i>Combinatorial Stochastic Processes</i> on my publication page. The purpose of this course is to bring graduate students specializing in probability theory to current research topics at the interface of combinatorics and stochastic processes, in particular the theory of random combinatorial structures such as partitions, permutations, trees, forests, and mappings, and connections between the asymptotic theory of enumeration of such structures and the theory of stochastic processes like Browian motion and Poisson processes. This course is more or less a summary and review of my research over the last ten years, much of it joint work with coauthors David Aldous, Jean Bertoin, Steven Evans, and Marc Yor. </p>'

S'<p>We are interested in the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance, synapse formation and activity-dependent refinement of neural circuits.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Transduction Mechanisms underlying axon guidance.</i> Using cultured Xenopus spinal neurons and cerebellar granule cells, we are examining the cytoplasmic events associated with neurite growth and the response of the growth cone to extracellular guidance cues. By applying defined extracellular gradients of guidance cues that cause attractive or repulsive turning of the growth cone, we can examine the early cellular responses at the growth cone triggered by the guidance cue and the involvement of various cytoplasmic signaling pathways in mediating the turning response. For long-range axon guidance based on the detection of chemical gradients, the growth cone must be able to respond reliably to small gradients of guidance cues across its surface. This may be achieved by amplification of guidance signals through intracellular transduction mechanisms. In addition, as the growth cone migrates in an environment in which the basal concentration of the guidance cue varies by many orders of magnitude, it also needs to constantly re-adjust its sensitivity through a process called adaptation. Current efforts are aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the amplification and adaptation of guidance signals at the growth cone.</p><p><i> Activity-induced modifications of neural circuits.</i> Early synaptic connections in the developing nervous system undergo substantial remodeling in response to electrical activity. Using nerve-muscle cultures, hippocampal slices, and retinotectal system in vivo, we are examining how various patterns of electrical activity and sensory inputs induce the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections, as well as the up- and down-regulation of the intrinsic excitability of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We are also interested in understanding how such activity-induced synaptic and neuronal modifications influence the developmental refinement of specific neuronal connections, using the Xenopus retinotectal system as a model system. In studying synaptic plasticity in nerve-muscle and hippocampal cultures, we have discovered an extensive spread of long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) from the site of induction to other synaptic sites within the neural network. This spread (or "propagation") of synaptic modifications is highly specific, implying selective spatial distribution of activity-induced changes within the network. We are currently studying whether various forms of LTP/LTD propagation occur in brain slices and in vivo. In the long run, we hope to understand the cellular signaling mechanisms underlying the propagation of LTP/LTD and the implication of such propagation for the processing and storage of information in the nervous system.</p><p><i> Neurotrophins as synaptic modulators.</i> Based on the observation that many exogenous neurotrophic factors can exert acute effects on neuronal morphology and synaptic efficacy, we are examining the possibility that synaptic secretion of neurotrophins are involved in the activity-dependent modification of synaptic connections. Specifically, we are studying how secretion and cellular actions of neurotrophins at developing synapses are regulated by the electrical activity. We are also interested in understanding how long-range cytoplasmic signaling in neurons can be achieved by localized reception of neurotrophins at the synapse.</p><p> Dr. Poo is interested in how neural stem cells differentiate into different neuronal types, in response to specific cellular environment within the neural tissue, and the factors that influence the incorporation of differentiated neurons into existing neural circuits within the neural tissue and the input/output functions of incorporated neurons.  To address these issues, they need to develop a variety of cell culture, brain slice culture, and acute brain slice model systems, and use a combination of molecular, cellular and physiological experimental approaches to analyze neuronal differentiation, the formation and functions of neuronal connections.</p>'

S'<p>The overall goal of our research is to understand the molecular and cellular basis of microbial pathogenesis and the mechanisms used by the host to defend against infection. Specifically, the lab is focused on the interaction of the facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> and mammalian cells. This fascinating microorganism is able to enter cells, escape from a phagosome and grow rapidly in the cytosol. By exploiting a host system of actin-based motility, the bacteria move through the cytosol to the cell membrane and into pseudopod-like projections (listeriopods) that are ingested by neighboring cells. This mechanism allows pathogens to spread from one cell to another without ever leaving the host cytoplasm thereby avoiding the immune response.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Cell biology of infection.</i> The primary L. monocytogenes determinant responsible for lysis of host cell vacuoles is the pore-forming cytolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO). We will continue to focus on the control of LLO synthesis and secretion, and its mechanism of action. The ultimate goal is to relate structural and biochemical information to its precise mechanism of action in both tissue culture and in mice. We are also characterizing a number of fail-safe mechanisms that prevent LLO toxicity in the host cytosol and thereby compartmentalize its activity to acidic vacuoles. Interestingly, mutants that fail to properly compartmentalize LLO activity are cytotoxic to infected host cells and attenuated for virulence in mice. The <i>L. monocytogenes</i> ActA protein is necessary and sufficient to mediate actin-based motility in cells and cell-freeextracts. Actin polymerization is controlled by interaction of ActA with the host Arp2/3 complex and members of the Ena/VASP family. During the next few years we will focus on the mechanism of ActA function and evaluate its role during infection.</p><p> We have recently developed a model to examine the interaction of L. monocytogenes with cultured Drosophila cells and are using RNA interference to identify and characterize the role of host proteins during infection.</p><p><i> Mechanisms of secretion.</i> We are interested in how bacteria regulate secretion. We have recently found that unlike gram-negative bacteria, L. monocytogenes and many other gram-positive bacteria have two secA genes. SecA1 is essential for viability while SecA2 mediates secretion of a subset of bacterial proteins including at least two peptidoglycan hydrolases. We are currently characterizing the role of the SecA2-dependent hydrolases during infection. </p><p><i>Immunity to infection.</i> Murine listeriosis is an outstanding model to study basic aspects of innate and acquired cell-mediated immunity. Using bacterial mutants blocked at various stages in the infection process, we are elucidating pathways of host cell gene expression in response to microbial infection. Our studies clearly document the presence of a vacuolar and cytosolic pathway of innate immune recognition. Microarrary analysis has revealed dozens of genes expressed in response to the cytosolic pathway including b-interferon. We are now investigating the in vivo roles of the cytosolic pathway using a combination of knockout mice and bacterial mutants. </p>'

S'<p>I have worked for more than forty years on physical and biological processes in lakes, estuaries, and the ocean. All have been directed toward the question: How do physical processes, like mixing and turbulence, currents and circulation, or mass and energy transfer at the surface, affect the biological processes in planktonic ecosystems? Most of my investigations addressed this question directly with field measurements. In addition, with approaches that do not involve data collection directly, I am also studying (or have recently studied): the impact of climate, the utilization of remote sensing, and the construction of mathematical and numerical models. Computer models of zooplankton in the California Current System, including the larval stages of fish and benthic invertebrates, are a present focus of studies in my laboratory. Numerical models of San Francisco Bay and the Eel river watershed are another emphasis for my students, post-docs, and me. We are also linking our modeling efforts to global climate models through collaborations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, CO.</p>'

S'<p>The principal theme of my research has been to discover and correlate biological features with traditional morphological evidence in the development of biosystematic relationships of microlepidoptera (small moths). My approach can be categorized along four lines:</p><ol><li>Systematics studies of particular taxa.</li><li>Comparative biology oriented along hostplant or ecological roles (e.g., yucca moths, fungus feeders, borers of woody composites, leaf miners, sand dune associates).</li><li>A broad spectrum larval rearing program.</li><li>Faunal inventory.</li></ol><p>The major taxa in which I have concentrated efforts are New World Tortricinae (Tortricoidea) and Ethmiinae (Gelechioidea), and Heliodinidae. I have carried out biosystematic studies of these and a variety of other moths, sometimes in response to requests from other biologists (e.g. in cooperation with forest entomologists) or as taxonomic problems became evident during biological and faunal studies.</p><p>Our rearing program is the most extensive in the history of the study of New World Microlepidoptera. During the past 50 years my students and I have processed more than 15,000 collections of larval or live adult Lepidoptera. Resulting data encompass more than 1,300 species of moths, through rearing either field-collected larvae or those emerging from eggs deposited by females in confinement. This total includes more than 60% of an estimated 1,600 species of Microlepidoptera occurring in California. We have summarized the collection data, larval food, and other data in an Access program.</p><p><i> Current Projects</i>:</p><ol><li>Classification of Nearctic and Neotropical Tortricinae. I have conducted long term studies of the Nearctic fauna, published a framework for the classification of Neotropical genera, species level treatments of several of the genera, and checklists of the North American and Neotropical faunas. Our studies on relationships among the Neotropical genera have emphasized the Tribes Archipini, Atteriini, Sparganothidini, and Euliini. A monographic treatment of Nearctic Sparganothini is in press.</li><li>Faunal inventories. In an era when there is considerable interest in biodiversity and extinctions, it is a paradox that we do not have a complete list of the Lepidoptera species, including an estimate of the undescribed species, for any state, county, or locality in North America. I have initiated inventories at several localities in California; the most comprehensive of these are the faunas of Santa Cruz Island, Walnut Creek, Inverness (Marin Co.), Big Creek and Hastings Reserve (Monterey Co.). During the past two decades I have devoted the largest portion of my time to the several other California Channel Islands.</li></ol><p>At Big Creek, we have processed more than 300 blacklight samples and 1,400 larval collections, and these represent about 350 species (37% of the known fauna of 950+ species). As a means of comparison to Neotropical faunal inventory, I was a collaborator on a 12-year NSF-sponsored project through OTS in which we sampled the biodiversity of selected arthropods at the La Selva Biological Station, an adjacent 2000 meter elevational transect in Costa Rica.</p><p>The ultimate goals of these biodiversity studies are to:</p><ul><li>Develop comprehensive local inventories of the species, which can serve as a baseline for comparison of other Nearctic and tropical faunal inventories.</li><li>Provide means for estimating species richness in North Temperate Zone lepidopterous faunas by projecting from species accumulation rates and from floral diversity, which often is documented well ahead of that of insects.</li><li>Analysis of larval host plant relationships of the Lepidoptera communities.</li></ul>'

We have studied, for example, the interplay of trophic dynamics with hydrologic and productivity regimes in northern California rivers, as well as impacts of invading alien species, and linkages between rivers and their watersheds. Much of our current field work takes place in the South Fork Eel River, within the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in Mendocino, CA, one of the University of California Natural Reserve System's 34 research and teaching reserves.

Research is focused on the structure-property relationships of load bearing medical grade polymers and biological materials. , , Current projects include the characterization of fatigue fracture mechanisms and tribological performance of orthopedic polymers. Surface modifications using plasma and low energy ion-beam methods are used to control texture development in medical grade polymers due to wear, fatigue and multiaxial loading and to tailor cell attachment for optimized biocompatibility. Retrievals of orthopedic implants are characterized to model in vivo degradation of synthetic cartilage and acrylic bone cements. Biomechanical characterization of cartid plaques and vascular tissue is performed to assess cardiovascular treatments and to develop predictive models for plaque rupture. The primary goal of these projects is to develop micromechanistic links between structure and propertied in load bearing tissues and their replacements. Laboratory techniques for structural characterization include TEM, FEM, SAXS, XPS, DSC, DGC, GPC, FTIR, AFM, fatigue testing, fracture analysis, and nonindentaion.'

S'<p>The overall objective of our research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the novel behavior of the quantum magnetism in magnetic nanostructures. As a magnetic structure is reduced to the nanometer size, quantum confinement of the electrons will generate fascinating properties such as the oscillatory interlayer coupling and the giant magnetoresistance. Investigation on these new phenomena will generate a great interest in the fundamental science and a great potential in the technology applications.</p><p>Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is used to fabricate the magnetic nanostructures with the film thickness controlled on the atomic scale. Using this "atomic engineering" technique, artificial structures will be synthesized and investigated in situ using the High Energy Electron Diffraction (HEED), Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), and the Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE).</p><p><strong> Current Projects </strong></p><p>Quantum Well Coupling: As the layer thickness is reduced to the nanometer range, electron confinement due to the potential barriers at the interfaces will result in the formation of Quantum Well (QW) states which play a very important role in the oscillatory interlayer coupling in the giant magnetoresistance multilayers. Our current investigation on this project involved two parts. First, we want to understand the relation between the interlayer coupling and the QW states in the momentum space. Second, we plan to engineer the QW wavefunction to generate new magnetic properties in these nanostructures. The magnetic coupling is measured by SMOKE, and the QW states are investigated by photoemission technique at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of Lawrence Ber keley National Laboratory (LBNL).</p><p>Quasi 1D magnetism: Research from the last decade has demonstrated that fascinating phenomena can be created by converting 3D bulk materials into 2D layered films. The next generation research is expected to be dominated by going from 2D films into quasi 1D systems. This is a challenging area with great potentials. Unlike semiconductor research whereas sub-micron size is already small enough to produce quantum effect, a magnetic heterostructure has to be controlled on the nanometer range to generate extraordinary phenomena. We use nanometer-sized atomic steps to realize the lateral modulation. Our preliminary results have demonstrated a great promising of this research direction.</p><p>Metastable Phases of Materials: The epitaxial growth of thin films makes it possible to stabilize some new phases of materials which do not exist in 3D bulk materials. This opens a new opportunity to investigate some fundamental physics from artificial materials created in the laboratory. For example, the fcc structure of Fe exists only above 910oC, making it impossible to study its magnetic phase. Using the MBE technique, we can stabilize the fcc Fe at room temperature so that to study its rich magnetic phases under various conditions.</p><p>Collaborative Researches: We are currently collaborating with the ALS at LBNL, the Argonne National Laboratory, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, to investigate various properties of the magnetic nanostructures. These include the element specific measurement by X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD), symmetry-breaking-induced magnetic anisotropy, and the colossal magnetoresistance junctions, etc.</p>'

S'<p>We are interested in understanding the molecular mechanism by which light regulates gene expression in plants. Our research program is focused on the phytochromes, the major and best-characterized family of plant regulatory photoreceptors. The photoreceptor molecule functions as a biological switch that, upon perception of the light signal, triggers changes in transcription which are detectable within 5 minutes of the stimulus.</p><p>The general strategy we have adopted toward this problem is fourfold: (a) to examine the phytochrome molecule for clues to its photosensory function and mechanism of action using structural analysis, phytochrome-defective mutants and overexpression of mutagenized phytochromes in transgenic Arabidopsis; (b) to study genes under phytochrome control to identify promoter DNA elements and transcription factors involved in induction or repression of expression; (c) to identify signal transduction pathway components between the photoreceptor and the genes it regulates using forward and reverse genetic screens for signaling-defective mutants, and molecular interaction screens for phytochrome-interacting proteins; and (d) to dissect the primary transcriptional networks that orchestrate the expression of downstream genes responsible for elaborating light-regulated development, using oligonucleotide-microarray-based expression profiling.</p><p>Our recent data suggest: (a) That the phytochromes signal directly to photoresponsive genes by light induced translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, followed by specific physical interaction with promoter-bound transcriptuion factors of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class; and (b) That genes encoding a master-set of diverse transcriptional regulators, that orchestrate downstream expression in the transcriptional network, are direct targets of this signaling pathway.</p><p>We have also recently exploited the unique features of the phytochrome system to develop a novel light-switchable gene promoter system that is potentially usable in any light-accessible eukaryotic cell system for rapid, conditional induction or repression of expression.</p>'

S'My work has consistently centered on modernity as a problem: problem for those seeking to live with its diverse forms, a problem for those seeking to advanceor resist modern projects of power and knowledge. This work has ranged from descendants of a Moroccan saint coping with the changes wrought by colonial andpost-colonial regimes, to the wide array of knowledges and power relations entailed in the great assemblage of social planning in France, to my work of the last decade on molecular biology and genomics. I now call this approach an anthropology of reason. Anthropos + logos. Who are the humans at issue and what knowledges constitute them and help them to understand themselves and their environments. <p>My current research is on the genome mapping project in Iceland as well as ongoing research in France on science, society, ethics, and philosophy.

S"Professor Radke's research focuses on combining principles of surface and colloid science towards engineering technologies where phase boundaries dictate system behavior. He employs modern spectroscopic tools along with molecular theory and simulation, and continuum transport and reaction engineering to provide quantitative description of interfacial behavior important to technology development. Specific areas of interest include: protein/polymer/surfactant adsorption from solution, two-phase enzymatic catalysis, interfacial surfactant transport, wetting and spreading, colloid stability, dynamics and stability of thin films, chromatography, multiphase and disperse phase flow in porous media, wettability of and chemical transport and reaction in porous media, electrokinetics, pore-level fluid mechanics, tear films, and contact-lens coating and physical design."

S"Professor Radke teaches Geographic Information (GI) Science and related courses in both the Department of Landscape Architecture &amp; Environmental Planning, and the Department of City &amp; Regional Planning. He has led an effort to bring GI System technologies to the campus and promote their use in the Bay Area. Professor Radke is recognized for his contributions to pattern recognition, specifically the development of metrics and methods for characterizing spatial structure, association and relationships between objects embedded in the landscape. His metrics, embedded in graph theory, attempt to eliminate scale and density constraints common to many popular spatial metrics and produce a more sophisticated definition. The applied results of his research occur within Geographic Information Science and seek to solve real world problems common in planning and design. One such metric has brought us a powerful new tool for delineating boundaries and transition zones (or ecotones) in very complex heterogeneous distributions. This metric allows us to define boundaries and detect change in complex patterns in the landscape which up until now was not possible. Another of his metrics generalizes the notion of neighborly and provides a tool for defining an entire spectrum of neighborhoods where spatial relationships between objects (plants) grow more complex. Where measuring and delineating neighborliness was once difficult and often impossible, we can now easily grow, map and measure sophisticated neighborhoods. The success of Professor Radke's Spatial Decomposition Project will help designers and planners better measure, track and document spatial structure and change in complex landscapes where sophisticated sensors record and log spatial distributions of phenomena beyond human comprehension. As these sensors and computers evolve, our ability to measure minute and accurate changes in the landscape will rapidly increase producing a data rich environment. Metrics, like those developed by Professor Radke, look hopeful for characterizing the morphology of landscape. Professor Radke applies these methods to the field of Environmental Planning where he designs and constructs hazard models in attempts to predict and assess risk. One such study mapped the risk of firestorms in the East Bay Hills, another detected potential erosion threats to the coastal zone in St. John (USVI), and another automatically generated street centerlines in the City of Berkeley. Professor Radke speaks to and consults for local , regional and national governments on issues relating to GI Science, environmental monitoring, and data mining."

S"<p>Michael Ranney's research explores the nature of explanation and understanding, in both formal and informal domains. His work is intended to foster the incorporation of challenging information (e.g., on global climate change). Regarding explanatory coherence, he, his students and his collaborators study and model the nature and utility of reasoning involving both supportive and contradictory relations. They also generate curricula, methods, and artificially intelligent software designed to improve rational thinking. Ranney's work on the representation and reorganization of scientific and societal knowledge exhibits the fragmentary nature of most lay people's knowledge--in arenas as diverse as physics, biology, abortion, and immigration. His latest projects study reasoning and policy-making involving socially important rates and statistics. He was a Spencer Fellow of the National Academy of Education and the Spencer Foundation, and he was a University of California Regents' Junior Faculty Fellow.  Currently he is head of the Reasoning Research Group, chair of SESAME (the Graduate Group in Science and Mathematics Education), a member of IPSR (the Institute of Personality and Social Research) and is a member of the interdisciplinary Cognitive Science faculty (e.g., ICBS).</p>"

S'<p>Dr. Raulet, a recognized expert in NK cells and T cell development who hascollaborated on studies to differentiate mouse NK cells from ES cells, will adaptthe human culture system to promote the differentiation of human NK cells and gdTcells. Success in developing the culture system will enable detailed dissections ofcellular interactions, genetic regulatory events, and DNA rearrangements thatunderlie T and NK cell development. </p><p>Lymphocytes employ various recognition strategies to attack viruses,microorganisms and cancer cells. The corresponding lymphocyte receptor proteins aremembers of diverse families, many of which are clonally distributed in expression.Our primary interests are in understanding how the various receptor molecules usedby natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are employed in the recognition ofpathogens and cancer cells, and how these receptors regulate lymphocytedevelopment.</p><p><i>Natural killer cells.</i> Natural killer (NK) cells play roles in immunity toviruses, parasites, and cancer cells. Individual NK cells express two classes ofreceptors, one that stimulates the cells, and another that inhibits. Recently, weidentified a stimulatory receptor expressed by NK cells, and expression-clonedcellular ligands for this receptor. The ligands are not expressed by most normalcells, but are induced in most tumor cell lines. Expression of the ligands by tumorcells triggers a dramatic immune response resulting in tumor cell rejection. Thisreceptor-ligand system is the first well understood stimulatory circuit in NK cells,and represents an example of a newly appreciated arm of innate immunity, in whichtransformed, infected, or otherwise "distressed" cells upregulate ligands thatstimulate an immune attack upon the cells. Significantly, the receptor is alsoexpressed by killer T cell. Using tumor and infection models, knockout mice andmonoclonal antibodies, we are determining the role of NKG2D in immunity andinvestigating the signals that diseased cells to upregulate the ligands. Otherstimulatory NK receptors and their ligands are under investigation.</p><p>Mostinhibitory receptors expressed by NK cells recognize class I MHC molecules andfunction to prevent the lysis of cells that express class I molecules normally, andallow the destruction of those that do not. We have recently discovered a newinhibitory receptor-ligand interaction (NKR-P1B-Ocil) that also may play a role inrecognition of diseased cells. We have uncovered fascinating cellular and molecularmechanisms that determine which inhibitory receptor genes are initially expressed byNK cells, and how these receptors influence subsequent NK cell development. Themolecular basis for these mechanisms are being investigated using a combination ofcellular, genetic and gene targeting approaches.</p><p><i>T cell development and function</i>. In the thymus, alpha/beta  T cells andgamma/delta T cells differentiate from a common precursor cell. We are investigatingthe role of cytokine signals and T cell receptor mediated signals in this process.Subsequently, in the alpha/beta T cell lineage, selective processes allow thedevelopment of "useful" T cells from a population of early T cells withheterogeneous specificities. We demonstrated for the first time that thepre-selected T cell population is inherently reactive with polymorphic MHCmolecules. Current studies investigate the germline-encoded specificity for MHC andhow it is modified as T cells develop. In the gamma/delta T cell lineage, we showedthat instead of a largely random gene rearrangement process, a directed V generearrangement process occurs, which helps to generate waves of distinct thymicprogenitor cells with different specificities independent of cellular selection.With the use of transgenic and gene-targeted mice, we have demonstrated that V genepromoter sequences and the location of the gene determines the order in which it isrearranged in development. The system is ideal for unraveling important features ofthe developmental regulation of V-D-J recombination. We recently discovered anintrathymic selection process for gamma/delta T cells that operates in the fetalstage, and induces a gene program that enables fetal gamma/delta T cells to migrateto intraepithelial locations.  We are currently investigating the underlyingmolecular mechanisms. </p>'

S'<p>Professor Raymond\'s research interests range from biochemistry and metals in medicine to physical inorganic chemistry. The underlying theme of the research projects is the question of metal-ligand specificity of interaction in coordination and bioinorganic chemistry. The specific current research areas are:</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Supra-Molecular Coordination Chemistry</span>.  The structures of protein clusters such as ferritin (24 subunits) or many viruses (60 subunits) are highly symmetrical. What generates the selective formation of these highly symmetrical clusters? For ferritin there are 4-fold and 3-fold axes that are generated by specific lock and key interactions. The simultaneous interaction of a different lock and key interaction to make a trimer drives the formation of a 24 subunit cluster with O symmetry. We are using an approach that uses different coordination numbers to drive the formation of clusters on the nanometer scale.  Host-guest chemistry of such clusters displaying or enabling is particularly attractive for new kinds of chemical behavior.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Lanthanide and Actinide Coordination Chemistry</span>. The use of paramagnetic metal complexes as image enhancing agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is opening up a new field of coordination chemistry. The group is involved in the synthesis and characterization of such compounds, particularly Gd(III) complexes.  In particular, these act as synthetic enzymes with rate enhancements of more than a million and are the basis for the technology in Lumiphore, Inc., a company cofounded by Professor Raymond.  Fluorescent lanthanide agents are being developed for other kinds of imaging or analysis. As a potential environmental hazard, plutonium is particularly toxic because of the remarkable similarity of Pu(IV) and Fe(III) - which entrains Pu in the biological iron transport and storage system of mammals. This similarity is being used in a biomimetic approach to Pu-specific ligands.</p>'

S'<p>Humans have modified the chemical composition of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere  through emissions of radiatively and environmentally active compounds.  Consequently, our society faces a triumvirate of interrelated global  atmospheric chemistry issues: stratospheric ozone depletion, the  enhanced greenhouse effect, and the changing capacity of the atmosphere  to oxidize pollutants. The primary players in these atmospheric  chemistry problems are the trace gases, which account for only a  fraction of a percent of the total atmospheric composition. My field of  research is trace gas biogeochemistry, which involves elucidating the  interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere, soils, and hydrosphere.  <br /><br />My work involves laboratory and field-based measurements in  different terrestrial ecosystems, such as coastal salt marsh, chaparral,  desert, tundra, boreal forest, grassland, and temperate forest. My  research seeks to identify natural terrestrial sources and sinks of  important trace gases, to quantify their fluxes, and to determine the  environmental and biological controls on those fluxes. Recent  innovations in measurement technology and analytical design have allowed  for the precise and accurate analysis of gases at the  parts-per-trillion concentration levels, opening up a wealth of research  opportunity to study their biogeochemical cycles.</p>'

I have enjoyed interactionswith researchers in many areas, especially the natural sciences, which have given meopportunities to learn about these fields and to make contributions to them.Underlying these separate analyses are paradigms of statistical methodology thathave been developed over the last 100 years.

S'<p>The purpose of my research is to develop better tools for utilizing far infrared and millimeter wavelength radiation and to use these tools to make measurements in important areas of physics. Many of the now standard techniques for laboratory far infrared spectroscopy were first developed in my program. Our critical inventions and developments have led to improvements in direct detector sensitivity by a factor 10exp7 and heterodyne receivers by a factor 10exp2. These technical improvements have created opportunities for research in many fields. We have focused on the far infrared spectroscopy of solids and on experimental cosmology, especially the spectrum and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation.</p><p>The MAXIMA experiment to measure the anisotropy of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background occupied my group for a number of years. These measurements yielded experimental estimates of the power spectrum of the microwave background over a wide range of angular scales. When compared with theoretical calculations of the power spectrum based on various cosmological models, these measurements provided detailed tests of cosmological models and precise measurements of important cosmological parameters. The MAXIMA experiment involved a 1.3 meter balloon telescope, and 16 bolometric detectors cooled to 0.08 K by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.</p><p>A recurrent theme of our research is the development of improved bolometric detectors of far infrared and millimeter wavelength radiation. In collaboration with Professor Adrian Lee of the Department of physics, we are using the techniques of thin film deposition and microfabrication to develop large format arrays of superconducting bolometers with transition edge sensors and multiplexed SQUID readouts.Current projects include the MAXIPOL balloon experiment and the Polar bear Ground based experiment to measure the anisotropy of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.  Also, the APEX experiment uses the scattering of the microwave background (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) to search for large numbers of clusters of galaxies to learn about the early development of structure in the universe. Many technologies are involved in these projects, including optics, cryogenics, analog and digital electronics, mechanical design, control engineering and system engineering.</p>'

S'<p>Our research program focuses on three general areas\xe2\x80&#148;1) basic biology of tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis; 2) genetics of drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant infections; and 3) infectious diseases of urban slums in developing countries.      Tuberculosis pathogenesis research currently focuses on delineating the mechanism of latency and reactivation from latency.  In particular, the laboratory has been studying a family of operons called mce (mce1-4) that resemble ABC transporters, possibly involved in lipid transport across the cell wall of M. tuberculosis. Mutants disrupted in the operon are studied for their phenotype in mouse models.  The basic pathogenesis research has led to several translational research activities. These include the development of a new therapeutic/adjunctive TB vaccine and new biomarker-based diagnostic and prognostic tests for TB       The second basic research area involves characterizing the genetics of drug resistance in Gram negative bacterial (GNB) pathogens.  We have launched a long-term project to identify every possible drug resistance genes in saprophytes in food that could potentially enter pathogens.  Recognized drug resistance genes are also being characterized from GNB pathogens obtained from clinical sources domestically as well as abroad.       The laboratory has field sites in Brazil and India where we conduct studies to assess burden of infectious diseases that are predominant in urban slum settlements, including leptospirosis, rheumatic heart disease, and TB.  Products of the basic research above (e.g., new diagnostic tests) are often applied at these sites to assess disease burden.      Thus, our research program emphasizes linking basic biology research with translational research to address infectious diseases of global importance.</p>'

S'<p>The research in my lab is focused on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which we use genetic analysis to explore issues of gene regulation and cell biology. In addition, we are developing genomic-based approaches to the study of cells by parallel analysis of the expression of all genes simultaneously. Our goal is to create a new kind of genetic analysis in which the genome is used as the unit of function, rather than individual genes or proteins. The gene regulation work focuses on the coupling between certain origins of DNA replication and the establishment of domains with different transcriptional states. The cell biology work focuses on the regulation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the roles intermediates of this pathway play in the covalent modification of numerous proteins including the Ras oncoprotein and in the trafficking of prenylated proteins.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p>The a and a cell types of yeast are controlled by transposable genes that are alleles of the mating type locus (MAT). These alleles are complex blocks of DNA encoding regulatory proteins whose synthesis controls the expression of genes that specify the identity of different cell types of yeast. In addition to MAT, the a and a genes are also located at two additional loci, known as HML and HMR, where they are transcriptionally silenced. Transcriptional silencing requires a complex series of interactions between proteins, regulatory sites, and origins of replication that result in the establishment of inactive chromatin in these regions. This repression is one of the few cases in biology in which changes in chromatin structure have been shown to cause changes in gene expression. </p><p>We have focused our efforts on the SIR genes, which encode proteins required for this position-dependent regulation, and on the silencers, which are sites required for the silencing of flanking sequences. Repression mediated by the SIR genes involves the assembly of inactive states of gene expression at HML and HMR. These states ohed, are epigenetically inherited, and thus offer the most genetically tractable opportunity to study the inheritance of states of chromatin structure. Remarkably, the silencer also functions as a chromosomal origin of DNA replication, and we have discoverd that ORC, the eukaryotic replication initiator, plays a critical role in silencing. </p><p>Our work on cholesterol biosynthesis has focused HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. We have discovered that the level of this protein is regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels, and by regulation of protein stability. We are now exploring the mechanisms by which these effects are achieved. This protein is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and has a topology reminiscent of the G-protein coupled receptors. We are using the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase to study how the endoplasmic reticulum is assembled, expanded, and degraded. Recent work identified a role for the proteosome in the regulated degradation of certain ER proteins. </p><p>We discovered that intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are covalently coupled to numerous proteins, known as prenylated proteins, including the Ras oncoprotein. Moreover, this modification is required for the oncogenic activity of Ras protein and may provide a target for novel cancer chemotherapies. We are examining the role of this modification in various aspects of Ras function and in other areas of cell biology. Yeast has approximately 100 prenylated proteins that are involved in a variety of assembly and signalling processes. Moreover, we have recently identified two novel proteases that are required for the proteolytic processing of the carboxyl terminus of many prenyl proteins. These proteases reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. In cells lacking these proteases, the localization of prenyl proteins is altered, revealing a new dimension to protein trafficking, and suggesting novel routes for the localization of some membrane proteins. These proteases offer promise as drug targets for Ras based tumors. </p><p>The genomic projects employ fluorescence-based readouts of gene expression in yeast. We are developing the expression profiles of all genes in response to mutations in each gene. These profiles are revealing a wealth of information on how the functions of cells are interconnected, and when combined with profiles induced by chemical compounds, provide the first seamless interface between chemistry and genetics. </p>'

S'<p>The general interests of our laboratory are the mechanisms and regulation of DNA rearrangements (transposition), DNA repair, and the control of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. We study these processes using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model system. Our research focuses on the P element family of transposable elements to study the specificity and coordination of these nucleic acid rearrangement reactions and the interplay between P elements and their cellular host. The P element system offers the ability to effectively combine the use of biochemical, genetic, molecular biological and proteomic approaches to study these fundamental aspects of gene regulation. The ability of transposable DNA elements to be mobilized and to cause mutations and chromosomal rearrangements is thought to be important for genome and organismal evolution. In fact, half the human genome is composed of transposons. P element transposition is related to retroviral DNA integration, such as HIV, and to the process by which immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are rearranged in the vertebrate immune system [V(D)J recombination]. P elements use cellular DNA repair pathways to process DNA double-strand breaks generated during P element transposition. A second research interest involves alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, which is an important mechanism for the regulation of gene expression in metazoans and leads to significant proteomic diversification. Understanding how pre-mRNA splicing is controlled will be important since at least 20-30% of the known human and mouse disease gene mutations affect the splicing process. Our studies deal with the interaction of proteins with RNA and DNA as well as the assembly, composition, structure, function and biochemical activities of nucleoprotein complexes.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Biochemistry and regulation of P element transposase, the mechanism of transposition and DNA repair.</i> The 87kD P element-encoded transposase protein is required to catalyze P element transposition. Studies using the purified protein to develop a series of in vitro assays for the different stages of P element transposition revealed that GTP is an essential cofactor for the reaction. Current studies are aimed understanding the role that GTP plays in transposition, the detailed reaction pathway and how modifications can control the biochemical properties of transposase. We are also interested in understanding how Drosophila cells repair DNA strand breaks caused by P element transposase. These broken DNA ends are repaired by a process termed non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Many of these repair proteins are conserved in evolution and include the ATM family of PI3-related protein kinases (in Drosophila dATM and mei-41) and the Bloom\'s DNA helicase involved in DNA damage responses. We are investigating whether phosphorylation of transposase might control its activity to be coordinated with the cell cycle, with DNA repair or in response to DNA damage using biochemical, genetic and proteomic approaches. </p><p><i>RNA-protein complexes and the biochemistry of regulated pre-mRNA splicing in Drosophila.</i> P element transposition only occurs in the germline, but not in somatic tissues because of tissue-specific pre-mRNA splicing. The third P element intron (IVS3) is removed only in Drosophila germline tissues to produce the transposase mRNA, but IVS3 is retained in a somatic mRNA that encodes the 66kD repressor protein. This regulation involves RNA binding proteins that recognize a regulatory element in the IVS3 5\' exon that results in splicing inhibition. The PSI (P element somatic inhibitor) protein has four N-terminal KH-type RNA binding domains and a glutamine-rich C-terminal domain that directly interacts with U1 snRNP. This interaction promotes U1 snRNP binding to specific sites on the pre-mRNA. Expression of PSI is restricted predominantly to somatic cells and ectopic expression of PSI in the germline inhibits IVS3 splicing. The Drosophila hnRNP protein, hrp48, recognizes the 5\' exon regulatory element in vitro and mutations in hrp48 activate IVS3 splicing in somatic cells. We are using cDNA microarrays to identify cellular mRNAs present in RNP particles containing PSI and hrp48. We are interested in whether the incorporation of hnRNP proteins into RNP particles might generate a "code" to how specify how pre-mRNAs are processed. Another project involves U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF), a member of a family of general splicing factors that contain arginine-serine-rich (R/S) domains. U2AF is a heterodimeric RNA binding protein that recognizes intron polypyrimidine tracts and functions in 3\' splice site selection. A new area of investigation involves the relationship between RNA editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) and pre-mRNA splicing. In collaboration with Jennifer Doudna\'s lab, we are attempting to solve X-ray structures of these RNA-protein complexes.</p>'

Such processes include organizational structuring, decision making, reward systems, leadership, motivation, etc. The research also examines inter organizational processes that can influence error reduction. For example, today many organizations create products by transmitting incomplete units from one organization to another that contribute to the product end result. Errors occur frequently at the transfer points and little is understood about the organizational processes contributing to error generation or reduction.</p>'

Both topics   are viewed especially in the context of conservation biology. The work   addresses both basic and applied questions, taking advantage of the   opportunities associated with the geography of Pacific Basin, Pacific   Islands, and Pacific Rim, including California.Research in my lab  includes studies of the origins of endemic and  non-indigenous  organisms; processes associated with colonization and  invasion; and  population structure, including identification of  management units and  conservation genetics. Related work examines the  role of population  subdivision and host use in the formation of species  and in the  conservation status of Pacific arthropods.One emphasis concerns trophic  interactions; how they come to be and  how they change over time. These  issues are fundamental to processes of  colonization and establishment  of organisms in novel environments. Such  processes are important not  only in natural settings, for example, as  organisms colonize new areas  or switch to new hosts, but also in managed  systems, where such factors  determine the impact of biological  invasions and the success of  classical biological control.'

S'<p>My current research seeks to understand how countries gain from being open to the rest of the world. Such gains from openness take place through international trade, multinational production, and the diffusion of ideas. How large are the gains from openness for different countries and how important are these different channels in generating those gains? Answering these questions is valuable as countries work to deepen their economic integration with the rest of the world. Should countries focus on removing the remaining barriers to trade or should they pay much more attention to the elimination of the impediments to the inflow of foreign ideas through MP, licensing, or any other form? This is important for smaller countries, which arguably stand to gain much from their interactions with the rest of the world.</p><p>Openness is also important for the United States: what are the consequences of the increasing internationalization of production by U.S. firms on aggregate income as well as on different types of workers. By using their technologies abroad, U.S. firms can lower their costs, and this leads to a combination of higher profits and lower prices for domestic consumers. But this has a downside for U.S. production workers: production abroad by U.S. firms effectively generates competition for home-country workers, and this tends to lower wages in the U.S.</p>'

S'<p>My interests center on collective phenomena and ordering in condensed matter and biological systems. In the past, I have worked on high-temperature superconductivity, quantum antiferromagnetism, the fullerenes, and liquid crystals. My current interests include the theoretical and computational modeling of molecular, cellular, and collective properties of biological systems, as well as the behavior of quantum fluids like cold atomic gases and high temperature superconductors.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p>The mammalian visual system is a complex system that is "self -organizing," in the sense that the connections between cells in the retina and brain arise spontaneously in the developing animal. These organized connections are not "hard-wired," but instead arise from a complex program of intercellular signalling. In particular, as the retina develops, it exhibits spontaneous electrical activity which propagates across patches in a wave-like manner; these waves have been implicated in the formation of ordered maps between the retina and the cortex. In collaboration with neuroscientists Marla Feller and Carla Shatz, Dan Butts and I have developed models for the interactions between cells in the developing retina. Our goal is both to model the specific behavior of the developing ferret retina for close comparisons with experiment, and to use such models to better understand the principles that govern real neural networks and systems. </p><p>The three-dimensional structure of a protein is typically specified by its amino acid sequence. This three-dimensional folded or "native" structure, in turn, allows the protein to fulfill its biological function, which may be enzymatic, structural, mechanical, etc. For many proteins, the folded structure is the equilibrium state under physiological conditions, and they are typically stable by 5 -15 kT. By heating them, changing the pH, or adding certain chemicals to the water in which they are dissolved, proteins can be unfolded in a "cooperative" or first-order transition. When such unfolded or "denatured" proteins are returned to physiological conditions, refolding typically occurs rapidly (on the order of milliseconds) and reproducibly. How does this process occur? What are there general principles by which proteins can find their stable folded states? How is this information encoded in their sequence? To answer these questions, Vijay Pande, Nik Putnam, Jarrod Chapman and I are developing and studying models that range from simplified lattice polymers to complete molecular dynamics with solvent, as well as new analysis techniques to characterize the folding process. </p><p>I am also interested in the behavior of quantum mechanically degenerate atomic vapors in confined geometries, including both Fermi and Bose systems. Unlike liquid 4He, the recently discovered atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are dilute, compressible systems confined by inhomogeneous trap potentials. How are the properties of a Bose condensate affected by an external potential? How will it respond to external probes? What sorts of vortex states are possible? Can interactions and/or disorder destroy the Bose condensate? Are they superfluids? </p><p></p>'

Our lab investigates these earliest stages of vision, from the formation of the retinal image to its sampling by the photoreceptor mosaic.</p><p>We develop advanced instruments to measure and overcome the optical limits of the eye. For example, we employ adaptive optics - a technology originally developed for astronomical imaging from ground-based telescopes - to correct the eye\xe2\x80\x99s aberrations and to image and/or present stimuli to the retina with unprecedented resolution. Overcoming optical limitations with adaptive optics has allowed us to make new discoveries in vision science, from mapping the trichromatic cone mosaic for the first time ever to learning how human visual acuity responds to an aberration correction.</p><p>Our most recent effort involves the development and use of the Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) for such clinical applications as blood flow, optical sectioning of the retina, microperimetry, precise measurements of fixation and eye-tracking. We are making instruments more robust, and we are making them more compact using state-of-the-art wavefront correcting technology such as MEMS deformable mirrors. Such non-invasive microscopic imaging techniques promise to improve diagnosis, understanding and even treatment of blinding retinal diseases.</p>'

S'I have two main areas of research: 1). Concepts and categories.  My basicidea is that conceptsform to mirror real world structure rather than adhering to the formal logic ofclasses (which isthe way they have been treated since Aristotle). I have shown that categories asprocessed by themind do not have clear cut boundaries, have gradients of class membership, and aregenerallyrepresented by concrete over-determined images rather than abstract criteria formembership. They form around salient examples, salience which can be perceptual, cognitive,cultural,statistical, etc. Furthermore, the level of abstraction which people judge to be thebasic or realname of an object is determined by the practices with which individuals andsocieties engage withthe objects.  Presently I am extending this work to show the ways in whichcategorizations andconcepts, rather than referring to objects, actually function as inherent parts ofthe events inwhich they are employed.  2). Religious psychologies.  I have been endeavoring todemonstratethe implications for modern psychology of practices and concepts from Buddhism andfrom thecontemplative aspects of Western religions. Most psychology of religion deals withsurfacemanifestations of religions such as verbal statements of belief or the cognitivetendency topersonification. I believe that meditative and contemplative practices show how thehuman mind iscapable of functioning quite differently from the assumptions of psychology and thatthis isimportant for the present state of the world. Representative papers from both of myareas ofresearch can be accessed via my profile on the Psychology Department website.'

S'<p>During 20 years (1974-1994) LBL Buildings Program developed or accelerated four products, each of which will save consumers in energy bills: electronic ballasts for fluorescent lamps, compact fluorescent lamps, low-emissivity ("heat mirror") and selective windows and DoE-2 computer program for the energy design of buildings. </p><p><b>Current Projects </b></p><p>While I\'m in Washington, I still try to link physics graduate students with researchers in the Energy and Environment Divi sion at LBL. The LBL/CBS has major programs in: </p><p>Building Technologies: In the area of windows research, major projects include helping accelerate the development and market introduction of windows incorporating high-transmittance, low-emissivity (low-E) coatings, development of new analytical models and experimental procedures to predict the thermal and solar-optical properties of complex assemblies of glazing materials and shading devices, and conducting daylighting testing of scale models in a unique 24-foot diameter sky simulator. In the area of lighting research, major projects include developing high-frequency electrodeless lamps, replacements for both fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps, and improvements in fixture efficiency combined with effective use of lighting controls. One program research team has obtained data on the effects of lamp spectral composition on visual performance and on brightness perception, and how these results can affect improvements in the energy efficiency of lighting design. In the area of building energy simulation, the Program is enhancing and simplifying its DOE-2 program, a whole-building analysis program. </p><p>Energy Analysis: The program conducts research in the areas of international energy studies, building energy data, building energy analysis, energy conservation policy, global energy and environmental issues, utility planning and policy, and end-use fore casting. Some of the major projects include developing scenarios for long-term energy demand in developing countries, assessing policies affecting energy use, promotion of integrated resource planning for utilities and demand-side management programs, development and application of techniques for forecasting energy demand, and energy conservation potential. </p><p>Indoor Environment: The program conducts integrated research on building ventilation, indoor air quality, and energy use and efficiency in buildings. The purpose of this research is to increase energy efficiency of buildings while maintaining or improving occupant health and comfort. Indoor air quality projects are focused on understanding the dynamic processes within buildings that control pollutant sources, transport, transformation, deposition, re-emission and removal. Spatial and temporal variability of pollutants and pollutant sources and the factors controlling variations in indoor air quality are also characterized. This research also provides the basis for models of population exposure to various types of pollutants. The effectiveness of various ventilation systems for pollutant removal is also investigated. Methods for characterizing ventilation and building energy use are developed for experimental and applied uses. </p><p>To arrange a tour of CBS and other parts of EE Division, and learn of current research opportunities, call CBS Director, Dr. Evan Mills (486-6784, <a href="mailto:EMills@lbl.gov">EMills@lbl.gov</a>) or consult the CBS Home Page (<a href="http://eande.lbl.gov/CBS/CBS.html" title="http://eande.lbl.gov/CBS/CBS.html">http://eande.lbl.gov/CBS/CBS.html</a>) </p>'

S'<p>My current research is concerned with integrating past and present results in the regulation of cell growth and publishing them in scholarly articles.  I am doing the same in the area of spontaneous neoplastic transformation with emphasis on the contribution of epigenetic and genetic changes to its origin and expression.</p><p>Magnesium is required for every phosphate transfer reaction in cells.  Many of these reactions regulate important biochemical pathways, including the initiation of protein synthesis which is the key to the control of cell proliferation.  Variations in the concentration of free magnesium are controlled by the cell membranes and are responsive to growth factors.  These features of growth regulation are incorporated in the membrane, magnesium, mitosis (MMM) model of growth regulation.  The loss of membrane regulation of free magnesium levels in the cytoplasm results in cancerous behavior of cells.  A basic problem of cancer research is what kind of genetic changes disturb the membrane control of free magnesium.  More important than mutations in particular genes is the rearrangement of chromosomes to produce transposition of normal or mutated genes which make a major contribution to neoplastic development.</p><p>Growth of normal mammalian cells in culture results either in their eventual death or in chromosomal changes that allow them to multiply indefinitely.  In the latter case they can either maintain their normal regulatory properties or they become neoplastic, i.e., capable of producing tumors.  Since it happens without any known carcinogenic treatment, it is called spontaneous transformation, implying it is caused by random mutations regardless of conditions.  We have shown by work in permanent lines of mouse cells that the process is not spontaneous but depends on moderate to strong inhibition of cell multiplication, and is prevented by maintaining cells at low densities which allow maximal exponential growth of the cells.  Prolonged growth inhibition by contact at high population densities induces heritable changes in most or all of the cells which allow escape from the growth-inhibiting effects of contact inhibition.  The high proportion of cells heritably altered by growth inhibition indicates it depends on changes at the chromosomal level, most likely rearrangements such as transpositions, deletions, inversions and other aberrations.  These changes require enzymatic action that cuts both strands of DNA to cause breaks which can be rejoined to breaks in other chromosomes and disrupt normal genetic controls on gene expression.  We have found that the neoplastic cellular changes appear in concert with an enormous increase in cytoplasmic lysosome concentrations, many of which are abnormal.  Any leakage of lysosomal enzymes would include DNAase 2 which causes double strand breaks in DNA.  The massive lysosomal accretion is essentially an epigenetic or adaptive response which drives the chromosomal changes that lead to tumor development.  </p>'

S'<p>I am first an instrumentalist, attempting to develop sophisticated detectors capable of answering some of the most fundamental scientific questions of the moment. This is how I designed the UA1 Central Detector, a critical element in the discovery of the W and the Z. In the last 10 years, my main effort has been to develop phonon mediated detectors working at milliKelvin temperatures. I believe such advanced detectors may be necessary for the detection of the weakly interacting massive particles which could form the ubiquitous dark matter in the universe. The dark matter problem is currently one of the most central puzzles of astrophysics and cosmology. There is a good chance, in my mind, that it can be solved in the coming decade by the complementary work of relatively small teams such as those involved in our Center for Particle Astrophysics. </p><p>More generally, I like to work at the borders between several scientific disciplines, currently cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. I am fascinated both by the new perspectives offered by such a multidisciplinary activities, and by the current rapid experimental progress, fueled in part by the technology transfer between these fields. At the same time, I like to keep some involvement in the phenomenology motivating our effort, as I strongly object to the prevalent separation between theorists and experimentalists. I regularly collaborate with theoreticians to attempt to identify the generic aspects of the models we are trying to test. </p><p>I also believe it is essential to better link such research activities to society. I thus strongly encourage members of my group to get engaged in outreach activities, whether it is sharing with the public at large our exciting quest, involvement in K-12 education, or collaboration with industry. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Search for Dark Matter. My current activities involve four aspects, each of which offers research opportunities for graduate students: </p><p>1) Development of advanced phonon-mediated detectors. Our current effort is focused on development of sensors for out-of-equilibrium phonons, using superconducting films and tunnel junctions. </p><p>2) The CDMS I experiment. We are currently installing at Stanford the first stage of our Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), looking for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The coming months will be exciting as we will start counting with our novel detectors. We hope in the coming two years to improve the current sensitivity level by a factor of more than 50. </p><p>3) The CDMS II experiment at a deep site (probably at Soudan, Minnesota in collaboration with Fermilab). As we will soon be limited by the shallowness of the Stanford site, it is important to start preparation of a deep site experiment. We have already received funding for a duplicate cryogenic system. </p><p>4) Related phenomenological activities. I have recently collaborated with Griest, Kamionkowski and Jungman on various aspects of supersymmetric dark matter. I am open to the possibility of co-advising a graduate student with a theorist colleague. </p>'

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My areas of interest are communications, control, and signal processing. On the communications side, my interests are particularly in the areas of wireless and information theory. Within information theory, one of my current areas of interest is in developing conceptual tools needed to understand the fundamentals of &amp;quot;quality of service&amp;quot; beyond classical Shannon data rate. On the &amp;quot;quality of service&amp;quot; side, I have a particular interest in both delay and power consumption. To that end, I am interested in distributed control systems as they provide well formed mathematical models that do not mesh with the classical notions from information theory. In addition, distributed control is a setting in which we can explore the role of implicit communication/signalling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am also interested in how multi-scale heterogenous wireless systems can coexist peacefully within the context of cognitive radios. This is the general problem of spectrum sharing. Besides being an interesting case of distributed control, this brings legal and economic concerns together with communications and signal-processing in a non-trivial way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

She is an ethnographer, focused on gender, economic sociology, globalization, and feminist theory. Much of her research is in Latin America. Her primary research interests lie in the cultural constitution of economic processes, and in the creation of subjectivities within political economies. Her award-winning first book, Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico\'s Global Factories (<a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9001.html" title="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9001.html">http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9001.html</a>), analyzed the gendered dimensions of transnational production.

S"Central to our research interests is the total synthesis of natural products with a keen eye toward the development of new synthetic methods and strategies. In concert with this general program, we look to nature to inspire our choice of synthetic targets (natural products) and some of our strategies (e.g., bio-mimetic approaches) to natural product synthesis. The compounds that we synthesize in our laboratory may ultimately become important as tools to study biological systems or provide a starting point for the development of therapeutics., , The challenge of a total synthesis provides a unique opportunity to test the limits of synthetic methodology and to invent new reactions. The formation of carbon-carbon bonds (C-C bonds) is of fundamental importance to synthetic organic chemistry. Our group seeks to address some of the current limitations in synthetic organic chemistry by defining new directions for C-C bond formation and then validating our methodology in the arena of complex molecule synthesis. In this regard, we are interested in (A) C-C bond forming processes that are coupled with the energetically 'downhill' events of strain release and aromatization to provide new strategies to access natural product motifs, (B) the generation of metal vinylidenes under mild reaction conditions as a new entry into C-H functionalization and (C) novel access to reactive intermediates such as metallo-carbenoids and radicals. Ultimately, we anticipate that our interests will evolve, depending on a student's interest or fascinating new transformations that we encounter., , Among the natural products currently of interest in our group are the teleocidin B family of indole alkaloids (potent protein kinase C tumor promoters), the cyathane diterpenoids scabronine A and erinacine E (active stimulants of nerve growth factor biosynthesis) and the trichothecane sesquiterpenoids verrucarin A and satratoxin H which are mycotoxins that also possess cytotoxic properties."

S'<p>We are interested in the structure, function, assembly and interactions of biological macromolecules, with particular emphasis on the regulatory enzyme, aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase).</p><p><i> Revisiting allostery.</i> Recent x-ray diffraction studies resulting in a high-resolution structure of the free, nonallosteric, catalytic trimer of wild-typeATCase and mutant forms of the holoenzyme call into question the widely accepted structure of the so-called, relaxed (R) conformation of the holoenzyme. Previous crystallographic studies had designated the complex of ATCase with a bisubstrate ligand as the R state of the enzyme. However, it is now known from these recent studies that changes in the conformation may be the result of the actual binding event rather than the allosteric transition whereby the enzyme is converted from an inactive, taut (T) state to the activated R conformation. Various mutant forms with greatly altered allosteric equilibria serve as excellent targets for resolving this perplexing problem and for demonstrating the role of flexibility in controlling enzyme activity. </p><p><i>Formation of active enzyme from circularly permuted and fragmented polypeptide chains.</i> Instead of the polypeptide starting at residue 1 as in wild-type ATCase, it is formed biosynthetically with N- and C-termini at many different locations in the chain and the wild-type termini linked through a covalent bond. These circularly permuted molecules serve as models to relate in vivo folding of growing polypeptide chains to in vitro refolding studies of denatured proteins. We have developed a method for producing randomly circularly permuted genes, inserting them in an appropriate vector, and allowing E. coli to select those permuted chains, which assemble into enzyme. Parallel studies with fragmented polypeptide chains are aimed at understanding the formation of domains and the effect of deletions of helical regions on stability and the folding and assembly pathways.</p>'

S"<p>Our research is devoted to a molecular description of polypeptide translocation from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and of vesicular transport and membrane fusion among organelles of the secretory pathway.</p><p>A combination of genetic and cytologic evaluation of the secretion (sec) mutants has allowed a description of the secretory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Protein transport in yeast appears to be mediated by the same organelles and proteins that operate in mammalian cells. Molecular cloning analysis of SEC genes revealed striking structural and functional homology with corresponding mammalian genes.</p><p><i>Vesicle Transport Early in the Secretory Pathway</i></p><p>We have developed biochemical assays that measure the early events of polypeptide translocation into the ER and of vesicle-mediated protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Transport of yeast a-factor precursor is mediated by diffusible vesicles. The formation of these vesicles in vitro depends on the Sec proteins that were predicted to be involved from genetic and morphological inspection of sec mutant cells. Isolated transport vesicles contain membrane and internal proteins that are targeted to other compartments in the cell, but they are nearly devoid of proteins that are located in the ER. Thus, the budding mechanism somehow distinguishes transported from ER-resident proteins. This sorting and budding process is highly evolutionarily conserved; mammalian equivalents of the yeast Sec proteins have been isolated and are known to operate in the same location within the cell.</p><p> Vesicles formed in the transport reaction have an electron-dense, 10-nm coat structure that consists of the Sec proteins required in budding. This coat (COPII) resembles another coat complex (COPI) that creates transport vesicles within the Golgi apparatus. Our working model is that the Sec protein subunits of the COPII coat bind to the ER membrane and recruit cargo molecules into a cluster that then dimples the membrane to form a bud. A direct interaction between one of the COPII subunits, Sec24p, and membrane proteins is implicated in the capture of cargo proteins. This capture results in the concentrative sorting of membrane and secretory proteins, the latter being selected by an indirect interaction mediated by various membrane receptor proteins that link the coat to soluble cargo proteins. Fission of the bud from the membrane separates transported from resident proteins.Competition binding experiments suggest that certain membrane cargo proteins-such as the v-SNARE (vesicle-bound soluble NSF attachment receptor) Bet1p and proteins displaying a near carboxyl-terminal DxE sorting signal-share a common binding site on the Sec24p coat subunit. The location of this site has been established by atomic resolution structure determinations of Sec23/24p cocrystals in complex with Bet1p and with a peptide containing the DxE signal. Substitution of amino acid residues in this binding pocket retards the packaging of Bet1p and DxE-containing cargo proteins but not of a host of other secretory and membrane cargo proteins. Two other binding sites have been mapped by structure and site-directed mutagenesis. It is clear, however, that the coat contains additional information that remains to be deciphered.</p><p>In addition to a role in cargo selection, the COPII coat is responsible for the membrane shape change that accompanies vesicle budding. Liposomes formulated with phospholipids representative of a yeast ER membrane fraction bind the COPII protein in the same sequence of events and with the same nucleotide dependence as observed with native ER membrane. Furthermore, COPII buds and vesicles form on the surface of the liposome and capture solute from the interior of the liposome. Other coat protein complexes (clathrin and COPI) display similar budding activity on synthetic membrane liposomes.</p><p> A comparable reaction with mammalian COPII proteins has been reconstituted and is being used to explore the mechanism of transport of proteins implicated in familial forms of Alzheimer's disease.  Two proteins, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1), interact early in the secretory pathway to facilitate the formation of an APP fragment that forms amyloid deposits in the hippocampus and the amygdala of patients suffering from the disease.  We have reconstituted the packaging of APP and PS1 into COPII vesicles in lysates of neuronally-derived human cells.  Mutations in PS1 that potentiate the formation of amyloid render the mutant protein less competent for packaging.  Our working hypothesis is that PS1 mutations produce a somewhat misfolded form of the protein that retards traffic of the protease responsible for fragmentation of APP.  We plan to pursue this possibility by measuring the formation of amyloid fragments in the  cell-free vesicle budding reaction and by studying the formation of amyloid in embryonic stem cells that differentiate into nerve cells in vitro.</p><p>Sar1p, a key regulatory GTPase that initiates COPII assembly, has been implicated in a rare genetic form of a lipid absorption disease known as Anderson's disease or chylomicron retention disease (CMRD). The disease locus corresponds to one of two human SAR1 genes, one of which, SAR1a, is essential for most normal transport from the ER. The other gene, SAR1b, may regulate the traffic of a nonessential subset of cargo proteins. Chylomicron traffic is also unusual in that the lipoprotein particle substantially exceeds the diameter of a typical COPII vesicle (~500 nm versus 70 nm). Thus, Sar1b may regulate the assembly of a distinct COPII vesicle. A vesicle-budding reaction reconstituted with mammalian COPII proteins and ER membranes has been established to explore this and other unique features of human membrane protein traffic.</p><p><i>Transport of Membrane Proteins to the Division Septum</i></p><p>Most new cell surface proteins are assembled in the bud portion of a growing yeast cell. However, some membrane proteins define a ring that separates the bud and mother portions of a cell. With support from the National Institutes of Health, we have focused on the enzymes that make chitin, a carbohydrate polymer in the cell wall that grows inward from a ring to form a disk that separates daughter cells at the end of the cell division cycle. Chitin synthases (Chs1p, -2p, and -3p) operate at different stages in the cell cycle to form the ring (Chs3p) or the division septum (Chs2p). All three enzymes traverse the secretory pathway en route to the cell surface; however, Chs2p and -3p then end up tightly organized at the locus where chitin is deposited.</p><p>Surprisingly, the cell employs different mechanisms to organize the temporal and spatial deployment of Chs2p and Chs3p. Chs2p synthesis is regulated to ensure its availability is limited to the peak period of division septum formation. After cell separation, Chs2p is endocytically internalized and delivered to the vacuole, where it is degraded. In contrast, Chs3p synthesis and degradation are not regulated. Instead, Chs3p cycles between a late compartment of the Golgi apparatus, the early endosome, and the cell surface. We propose that the late Golgi/early endosome represents a holding station from which Chs3p is mobilized to the cell surface in response to a cell cycle cue or some other regulatory process. One such regulatory response is cell wall stress, which involves the mobilization of the reservoir of Chs3p, and the synthesis of new cell wall polymers, to strengthen the cell surface against various forms of temperature, chemical, and osmotic shock.</p><p>Genes required for Chs3p transport have been identified in a genetic selection for mutants defective in export and for mutants defective in the recycling of Chs3p between the early-endosome and trans-Golgi membrane. Anterograde transport of Chs3p requires two genes, CHS5 and CHS6, which encode peripheral membrane proteins localized to the trans-Golgi/early-endosome compartment. Chs3p appears to be recycled to the trans Golgi by a clathrin and clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1)-dependent traffic event. We have developed a permeabilized cell system, similar to that employed in our discovery of COPII, that reproduces the formation of Chs3p-containing transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi membrane. The combination of genetics and biochemistry should allow us to describe the molecular mechanism of protein sorting late in the secretory pathway.</p><p>Familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are promoted by mutations in at least three proteins that engage in the production of the amyloidogenic peptide (Abeta42) that characterizes neuritic plaques believed to be responsible for neurodegeneration.  Abeta42 is the product of proteolysis of a type I membrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is produced in a variety of tissues but which appears to generate amyloid only in the hippocampus and the amygdala.  Proteolysis is facilitated by a complex called the gamma-secretase, one subunit of which, presenilin 1 (PS1) (and its homolog PS2), is implicated in unscheduled proteolysis of APP.</p><p>    My lab has initiated a study of the traffic of APP and PS1 using a cell-free vesicle budding reaction that recapitulates the first step in the transport of membrane proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex in mammalian cells.  We find that mutations in PS1 retard the packaging of mutant PS1 and of wild type APP into transport vesicles. Our working hypothesis is that this delay in transport may potentiate the cleavage of APP in the ER leading to an accumulation of Abeta42 peptide in this intracellular location.   The mechanism that restricts the accumulation of Abeta42 to nerve cells remains unexplained.</p><p>    I wish to examine this pathway in normal and PS1 mutant-transfected human embryonic stem cells.  We have already performed the basic experiment with mouse embryonic stem cells, but the mutant transgenes are of human origin, thus the homologous reaction will be more pertinent and potentially instructive.  As more is learned about the differentiation of hESCs in vitro, it will be possible to examine the traffic of APP and PS1 in neuronal and other differentiated cell types derived from the hESCs.  The hope is that such a line of investigation will illuminate neuronal specific aspects of the generation of amyloid.</p>"

S'<p>Nancy Scheper-Hughes is Professor of Medical Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley where she directs the doctoral program in Critical Studies in Medicine, Science, and the Body. Scheper-Hughes\' lifework concerns the violence of everyday life examined from a radical existentialist and politically engaged perspective. Her examination of structural and political violence, of what she calls "small wars and invisible genocides" has allowed her to develop a so-called \'militant\' anthropology, which has been broadly applied to medicine, psychiatry, and to the practice of anthropology. She is perhaps best known for her books on schizophrenia among bachelor farmers in County Kerry (Saints, Scholars and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland) and on the madness of hunger, maternal thinking, and infant mortality in Brazil (Death without Weeping: the Violence of Everyday Life in Brazil). During the early 1980s she undertook an ethnographic study on the deinstitutionalization of the severely mentally ill in South Boston and on the homeless mentally ill in Berkeley. In 1994-1995 Scheper-Hughes moved to South Africa to take up a temporary post as Chair of Anthropology at the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Cape Town during the political transition. While there she began an on-going ethnographic study of the role of political and everyday violence in the pre and post-transition periods. She has written a series of essays to be published under the title Undoing: the Politics of the Impossible in the New South Africa. </p><p>Her most recent books are: Commodifying Bodies (co-edited with Loic Waquant), 2002, London: Sage (Theory, Culture and Society series). (Commodifying Bodies was published in an Italian  edition , Corpi in Vendita ,  Ombre Courte, Verona, Italia); and Violence in War and Peace: an Anthology (co-edited with Philippe Bourgois), 2004, London and Malden, Mass: Basil Blackwell.  Her book, The Ends of the Body: the Global Traffic in Human Organs is in preparation for Farrar, Straus&amp; Giroux, New York City. </p><p>Scheper-Hughes has conducted research, written on, and been politically engaged in topics ranging from AIDS and human rights in Cuba, death squads and the extermination of street kids in Brazil, the Catholic Church, clerical celibacy, and child sex abuse, to the repatriation of the brain of a famous Yahi Indian, Ishi (kept as a specimen in the Smithsonian Institution) to the Pit River people of Northern California. Her most recent research is a multi-sited ethnographic study of the global traffic in humans for their organs which she interprets as a form of invisible and sacrificial violence. Her next book, The Ends of the Body: the Global Traffic in Organs, is to be published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. </p><p>She is co-founder and Director of Organs Watch, a medical human rights project and she is currently an advisor to the World Health Organization (Geneva) on issues related to global transplantation. Scheper-Hughes has lectured internationally and has been a research professor in residence at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences in Paris in 1993 (and will take up that post again in the fall of 2004). </p>'

S'<p><i>The Regulation of Antigen Receptor Gene Rearrangement and Lymphocyte Development.</i> Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes are assembled during lymphocyte development by a novel series of highly regulated DNA rearrangement reactions known as V(D)J recombination. Understanding the regulation of gene rearrangement is important because its products (Ig and TCR molecules) control the development and function of B and T cells and because errors in the process can result in leukemia, lymphoma, or immunodeficiency disease. A single enzyme complex known as the V(D)J recombinase is required for the rearrangement of each of the seven complex genetic loci encoding antigen receptor chains. The recombinase recognizes a highly conserved DNA sequence, the RSS. Our data suggests that transcription or transcription factor binding targets the recombination reaction to a particular genetic locus at the appropriate stage of development. My lab is interested in determining the molecular basis of this link between transcription and gene rearrangement during B cell development. In addition, we are interested in the reaction mechanism of the V(D)J recombinase. </p><p>Using bone marrow, thymus and fetal liver from wild-type or recombination-deficient Ig or TCR transgenic mice, we have purified primary lymphoid cells "frozen" at different stages of development. We are analyzing signal transduction pathways, patterns of transcription factor activity and chromosomal DNA-protein interactions to determine the critical receptors, protein factors and DNA sequences involved in the regulation of B and T cell development and Ig and TCR gene rearrangement. We have also devised a series of novel assays which detect recombination reaction intermediates and are using them to study both the developmental regulation and reaction mechanism of the V(D)J recombinase. Recently, we devised an in vitro assay system which recapitulates the developmental regulation of V(D)J recombination and are engaged in the dissection of its molecular components.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Active projects in the lab include 1) an analysis of the influence of chromatin structure on the targeting of V(D)J recombination; 2) reconstitution of regulated V(D)J recombination in vitro using purified recombinase components and long DNA templates; 3) promoter and enhancer activities involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding the V(D)J recombinase (RAG1 and RAG2); 4) the use of gene targeting to determine the function of various domains of RAG1 and RAG2;5) identifying transcription factors and DNA sequences involved in the regulated activation of rearrangement at the Ig kappa locus and TCR beta locus; 6) determining the role of transcriptional enhancer sequences in the targeting of recombination and in coding joint formation; 7) elucidating the rules governing receptor editing; 8) studying the mechanism and determining the frequency of transposition events catalyzed by the recombinase during lymphocyte development; and 9) determining the role of surface-exposed phosphatidyl serine in B cell signal transduction and development. 10) using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze the role of nuclear structure in the regulation of V(D)J recombination.</p><p>His lab is interested in the developmental biology of early B and T lymphocytes. Using the mouse as their model system, they have helped define the cascade of gene regulatory events which result in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into committed B and T cell precursors and then on to mature lymphocytes. In particular, they have focused on the regulation of V(D)J recombination, the site specific DNA recombination reaction which is required for the assembly of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes from their component gene segments. In addition, they have embarked on studies of the mechanisms of malignant transformation during lymphoid development which result in leukemia and lymphoma. While the mouse has provided an easily manipulable model system, our ultimate goal is to understand these processes in humans. They propose to take advantage of a recently defined in vitro cell culture system which can support the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into T lineage cells in order to compare and contrast early lymphoid development in mice and humans. They also plan to adapt this system to generate and examine human B lineage cells as well. These studies should reveal key checkpoints in human lymphocyte development which might be amenable to therapeutic intervention resulting in treatments for immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases and lymphoid malignancies.</p>'

S"<p>The aim of our research is to understand how sensory information is processed to produce specific behaviors. We study taste perception in the fruit fly, Drosophila Melanogaster, an excellent model organism with a simple gustatory system and robust gustatory behaviors that is amenable to molecular, genetic and electrophysiological approaches. We are interested in defining taste neural circuits anatomically and functionally to examine how they operate, how they elicit behaviors and how they are modified by sensory experience.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The gustatory system in Drosophila is crucial for detecting food, selecting sites to lay eggs and recognizing mates. Taste neurons are distributed on many parts of the fly's body surface and they recognize familiar taste stimuli: sugars, salts, acids, alcohols and noxious chemicals. We have recently characterized a large family of ~60 candidate gustatory receptor genes (GRs) and found that each gustatory neuron expresses only one or a few receptors. These receptors provide essential molecular markers that we are using to examine taste recognition both in the periphery and in the CNS.</p><p><i> Ligand specificity and behavioral specificity of different gustatory receptorss. </i>To understand the function of different gustatory neurons, we are determining the ligands that different taste neurons recognize and the behaviors that they mediate. We are identifying ligands by a combination of genetic cell ablations and receptor misexpression studies, coupled with behavioral paradigms and calcium imaging experiments to assay taste responses. For example, gustatory neurons containing the same receptor gene can be ablated by genetically expressing a toxin and taste defects can be tested by simple behavioral assays, like food choice discrimination measured by food-coloring uptake. We are also expressing calcium-sensitive flourescent proteins in taste neurons_this allows us to monitor taste responses in the entire population of gustatory neurons in vivo with single cell resolution. To determine the behaviors that different neurons mediate even in the absence of identifying ligands, inducible activators will be expressed in gustatory neurons, so that each neuron can be stimulated one by one to examine the fly's behavioral response. These studies will allow us to identify a sensory neuron by the stimulus that it recognizes and the response that it generates and will provide a starting point for dissecting taste circuits. </p><p><i>Sensory maps in the brain.</i> In other sensory systems, information from the periphery is mapped in the brain to provide a representation of the external world in the internal wiring. For example, there are tonotopic maps of auditory projections and somatosensory maps of touch projections. The gustatory system of the fly is interesting both because neurons express unique complements of receptors and because neurons are distributed in an orderly array along the body surface. We are using molecular genetic approaches to examine whether gustatory projections are segregated according to the receptor that is expressed in the periphery and whether there is a topographic map of gustatory information. Chemosensory bristles contain one mechanosensory neuron as well as taste neurons, and we are examining how these two different sensory modalities are represented in the brain. Our motivation is to understand the internal representation of gustatory information in the first relay. </p><p><i>Information processing in the brain.</i> The subesophageal ganglion of the fly brain contains both axons of gustatory neurons and dendrites of motor neurons involved in taste behaviors. This suggests that the fly may have simple and localized taste circuits, with few connections between sensory stimulus and motor response. In addition, projection neurons may relay gustatory information to higher brain centers, perhaps for more complex associations. We are interested in mapping the functional and anatomical components of taste circuits using a variety of approaches. Genetic approaches to label subsets of neurons in the brain, behavioral screens for taste mutants, and calcium imaging of taste responses in the brain will help elucidate these circuits. These studies will provide insight into the integration of gustatory cues and the difference between sweet versus bitter, and will set the stage to examine how taste circuits are modified by learning and other sensory stimuli. We plan to study increasingly complex problems of neural integration by examining how different stimuli impinge upon taste circuits. </p>"

S'Plastic electronics are an attractive route to a wide variety of inexpensive, lightweight, durable devices. Much excitement in this area of research has focused on the synthesis of new, stable conductive molecules and devices. Crucial to the future of plastic electronics, however, is an extension of our knowledge of polymer properties onto this new class of materials. This involves not only devising methods to impart structural stability to these frequently brittle, oxidizable chemicals but also a necessity to control nanoscale polymer ordering in order to improve efficiency. Our research focuses on first understanding how the nanoscale morphology impacts performance and then devising routes to control this behavior.'

In-Vehicle safety applications (e.g. gap assistance, forward collisionwarnings) can base on this information to assist drivers for potential conflicts.</p><p>Each vehicle is equipped with GPS receiver and 802.11a wireless radio,     and our software system . The software system    consists of a GPS Broadcaster and a Neighborhood Map Builder. GPS Broadcaster    broadcasts vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s position onto 802.11a wireless network when it    receives a new measurement from the GPS receiver . Neighborhood Map Builder    listens to the wireless channel, and uses the Geo-cast protocol to filter    out any messages which are outside of its neighborhood. Higher layer applications    take these messages and transform them into vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s body fixed coordinate    frame.

S"<p>Professor Sequin joined the faculty in the EECS Department at Berkeley in 1977. He started out by teaching courses on the subject of very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, thereby trying to build a bridge between the CS division and the EE faculty. In the early 1980's, jointly with D. Patterson he introduced the `RISC' concept to the world of microcomputers. He was head of the Computer Science Division from 1980 till 1983. Since then he has concentrated on computer graphics, geometric modeling, and on the development of computer aided design (CAD) tools for circuit designers, architects, and for mechanical engineers. During the last five years he has collaborated with P. Wright in Mechanical Engineering on the CyberCut/CyberBuild project with the goal to streamline the path from creative design to rapid prototyping.</p><p>S\xc3\xa9quin's work in computer graphics and in geometric design have also provided a bridge to the world of art. In collaboration with a few sculptors of abstract geometric art, in particular with Brent Collins, S\xc3\xa9quin has found a new interest and yet another domain where the use of computer-aided tools can be explored and where new frontiers can be opened through the use of such tools.</p><p><strong>Research Interests</strong>: <br /> Geometric modeling; computer graphics; computer aided design tools for VLSI, mechanical systems, abstract sculptures, and architecture; human-computer interaction; mathematical visualizations.</p><div>"

She is particularly interested in the spatial production and organization of cities, neighborhoods, and learning contexts. She applies interdisciplinary perspectives to the study of urban education and socially constructed learning contexts, to break down the divides between academic disciplines, school and "beyond school" learning, youth\'s schooling and community lives, and "successful" and "less successful" students. Underlying all of her work is an interest in the experiences of socially-constructed and marginalized groups as they interact with multiple social service institutions across structured and segregated landscapes. Her most recent project was an ethnographic and historical study of the structured pathways of opportunity and denial traveled by African American youth from San Francisco\'s Fillmore neighborhood.</p>'

S"<p>Professor Shackley is currently engaged in a number of research and laboratory  projects and continues field and lab research on archaeological obsidian in western  North America including northern Mexico. This research continues to involve  undergraduate and graduate students in the x-ray fluorescence laboratories in the  Departments of Earth and Planetary Science and Anthropology, many of which have  based their Senior Theses and doctoral dissertations on this lab work.  Beginning in  2007, Shackley's Geoarchaeological XRF Lab became a National Science Foundation  supported lab, including a new Thermo QuantX EDXRF spectrometer, graduate student  support and general lab support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pursuing long-term research on Southwestern obsidian sources, Dr. Shackley  continues NSF and Stahl Endowment funding to continue the quantitative analysis of  archaeological obsidian from the Southwest and northern Mexico. Field research also  continues in the search for as yet unlocated sources of artifact quality obsidian,  particularly in Arizona, Chihuahua, and Baja California. Analyses of archaeological  obsidian from the Southwest is derived from all periods from Paleoindian to Classic  period Hohokam and Late Prehistoric.  Shackley pursues this research through  teaching the linked laboratory and field courses, cross-listed in Anthropology and  Earth and Planetary Sciences.</p><p>In 1996, Dr. Shackley began research with Dr. Bruce Huckell of the Maxwell  Museum, University of New Mexico , at McEuen Cave (AZ W:13:6 ASM), an Archaic period  rockshelter in the Gila Mountains of southeastern Arizona.</p><p>The rockshelter has yielded dates in the Late Archaic/Early Agricultural period  (2000-3000 B.P.), as well as a tremendous number of organic artifacts including  baskets, a complete atlatl, dart and arrow fragments, cordage, and early maize cobs.  Dry rockshelters are very uncommon in the southern Southwest, and the project  directors hoped to address the effect of both early agriculture and the advent of  bow technology on hunter-gatherer society. During the summer of 1997, working with  graduate students from the University of New Mexico and Berkeley, testing revealed a  large area of undisturbed deposits with maize cob fragments in association with  Cortaro, Chiricahua, and San Pedro Archaic projectile points. Obsidian hydration  analyses and radiocarbon suggest that the lower levels are not vertically mixed and  nine maize fragments submitted to the CAMS Lab at Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratories for AMS 14C dating yielded dates between over 4000 to 2200 B.P (2sd),  also indicating relatively intact deposits. The one 2sd maize date over 4000 years  old, while out of sequence, indicated one of the earliest forager-farmer occupations  in North America.</p><p>We received NSF funding for a second intensive field season in July 2001. We  expanded the area that appeared to be undisturbed and sampled the disturbed portions  of the cave. Twenty-three of the maize and squash remains recovered are over 4000  years old; the oldest suite of maize north of Mexico. The field results indicate  that maize arrived in the Southwest at a time when everyone was living as  hunter-gatherers, and maize, beans, and squash were not fully integrated into an  agricultural lifeway for almost 1000 years.</p><p>Since 2005 Shackley continues a long-term geoarchaeological project in the newly  formed Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern Mexico. This project is run, in  part, as the only geoarchaeological science field school in the U.S.(Anth 131C/EPS  171C) training undergraduates and graduate students in the emerging discipline  combining geology and archaeology to solve archaeological problems. The project is  funded by the National Park Service, Los Alamos National Lab and is in collaboration  with local native groups such as San Ildefonso and Jemez. After the field portion of  the study, students return to the Geoarchaeological XRF Lab at Berkeley in the  Undergraduate Research Program at Berkeley for intensive analysis of the obsidian  and other source materials from the caldera region giving students a breadth of  experience from the field to the lab.</p>"

S"<p>Professor Shank is intrigued by ultrafast processes in matter that occur on a time scale measured in femtoseconds. Recent advances in laser pulse generation and measurement techniques have opened up the possibility of experimental investigations in the femtosecond time domain. Such techniques have shown great promise for exploring a new class of problems concerning nonequilibrium phenomena in the condensed phase. In his laboratory his group is currently performing measurements which permit them to probe molecular dynamics in solution in a time short compared to a molecular vibration.</p><p>Recent work in his laboratory has included the study of dephasing of an optically excited polarization of a molecule in solution. In the past, attempts at such measurements have been frustrated by the lack of adequate time resolution. Two and three pulse photon echo experiments have been performed using 6 femtosecond optical pulses. Shank's group hopes to use these investigations to determine the role of solvent interactions and internal molecular degrees of freedom in the dephasing process.</p><p>With a sufficiently short optical pulse, it is possible to excite the entire manifold on Franck-Condon connected states for the first excited singlet for a molecule in solution. If the pulse is short compared to a vibrational period, it is possible to excite a nonstationary state which can be described by wavepacket motion on the excited and ground states of the molecule. This technique is being used to measure vibrational spectra of molecules undergoing photochemistry.</p>"

His first book, "194X," explores American architecture, planning, and consumer culture on the American home front. He is finishing a second book on the architecture and planning of the 1939 world\'s fair in San Francisco, where modernist, Beaux-Arts, and regionalist architects made their peace on the 400 acre tabula rasa of Treasure Island. He continues to write extensively on issues of memory and the built environment and is interested in the ways in which buildings have been disengaged from the urban fabric as part of urban and heritage planning. At Berkeley he teaches courses general surveys of architectural history and specialized courses in the above areas of interest.  Trained as an art historian at Princeton University, Professor Shanken is especially interested in the intersection of these fields, as well as in the historiographical and methodological traditions in architectural history.</p>'

S"<p>Thomas F. Shannon, Professor of Germanic Linguistics, member of the Dutch Studies Program faculty, and former director of the UC exchange program in Germany, has been in our department since 1980. He holds Master's degrees in German (SUNY Albany) and Theoretical Linguistics (Indiana) and a Ph.D. in Germanic Linguistics (Indiana). His areas of specialization are modern German and Dutch, particularly syntax and phonology, and he has published widely on a variety of topics, including naturalness, syllable structure, complementation and control, ergative phenomena, passivization, perfect auxiliary selection, and word order. He is particularly interested in functional and cognitive approaches, e.g. the affects of various semantic, pragmatic, and processing factors on syntactic phenomena. Working from actual texts, he is presently studying several word order phenomena in Dutch and German, especially the ordering of elements in the middle field as well as historical change in West Germanic, including Afrikaans, Low German, and Yiddish. Shannon has taught and conducted research in the Netherlands at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen on a Fulbright grant and researched at the Institut f\xc3\xbcr deutsche Sprache in Mannheim. Active professionally, he serves on MLA Executive Committees, the Editorial Advisory Board of the Journal of Germanic Linguistics, and the Executive Committee of the American Association of Netherlandic Studies (AANS), and was formerly Vice President of the Society for Germanic Philology. He is also editor of the AANS Publications series, and co-editor with Johan Snapper of the Berkeley Conference on Dutch Literature and Linguistics series. </p>"

S"<p>Michael Shapira received his B.Sc. and his Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Following receipt of his doctorate, Dr. Shapira moved to the Genetics department at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he trained with David Botstein and Man-Wah Tan as a Life Sciences Research Foundation postdoctoral fellow.</p><p>Research at the Shapira lab seeks to understand the fundamentals of host-pathogen interactions in the context of the whole organism. Understanding the mechanistic details of these interactions, while considering the natural context in which these interactions have evolved and in which they occur. To this end, studies at the Shapira lab utilize the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a powerful model organism for genetic studies, as a host model. The main goal is to understand how pathogens, specifically bacteria, are recognized, how this recognition is translated to the appropriate response, what are the specific mechanisms that direct responses to biotic or abiotic stress conditions and what is their capacity to integrate such signals.</p><p>One current point of interest at the lab is pathogen recognition. Although the immune responses of C. elegans to different pathogens have been characterized extensively, it is yet unknown how the worm differentiates between different pathogens. C. elegans does not use any of the pattern recognition receptors known to operation in other animals. This makes the identification of the mechanisms it uses doubly interesting as those may represent new pathogen recognition modules potentially functioning also in mammals.</p><p>Another point of interest is the C. elegans natural microbiota. C. elegans has been grown in the lab for several decades with E. coli as its sole source of food. While this greatly simplifies cultivating and working with C. elegans it has left researchers with no knowledge regarding the worm's interactions with microbes in its natural soil habitat. Several labs are now trying to bridge this gap. The Shapira lab focuses on understanding the roles played by the natural microbiota in the worm\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond to, and resist pathogens. Current effort are focused on studying two apparently distinct mechanisms through which two worm commensals provide protection from subsequent infection.</p><p>A spin-off of host-pathogen studies has opened a new direction in the lab, the study of aging. C. elegans provides significant experimental advantages for aging research, thanks to its short lifespan and its plasticity, enabling identification of lifespan modulating pathways. Studying a mechanism that provides protection from infection exposed a protein\xe2\x80\x99s age-dependent contribution to stress resistance. Activation of this protein, a homolog of the mammalian JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase, during development provides protection from environmental stress, but similar activation two days later in young adults causes increased stress resistance and shortened lifespan. This age-dependent functional reversal represents a mechanism of antagonistic pleiotropy, a principle that was proposed half a century ago to explain how aging has evolved. Characterization of this mechanism could provides important insights into the evolution of aging and the aging process itself.</p><p>Among his recent publications are: Shapira M, Hamlin BJ, Rong J, Chen K, Ronen M, Tan MW (2006) A conserved role for a GATA transcription factor in regulating epithelial innate immune responses. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103: 14086-14091; Kurz CL, Shapira M, Chen K, Baillie DL, Tan, MW (2007) C. elegans pgp-5 is involved in resistance to bacterial infection and heavy metal and its regulation requires TIR-1 and a p38 MAP kinase cascade.

S'<p>I am an experimental particle physicist whose interests lie in probing the most basic interactions in nature. There now exists a theory of the Strong and Electroweak interactions ("the Standard Model") that has been tested to high accuracy and that explains almost all existing experimental data. The great success of this theory provides a framework for asking even more basic questions: What is the physics that generates quark and lepton masses? What determines the size of the Fermi constant? What is the mechanism responsible for the CP noninvariance observed in nature? It is such questions that my collaborators and I hope to address. </p><p>Many extensions to the Standard Model offer possible answers to these questions. In a large class of theories we expect new phenomena to appear when quarks or leptons collide at center-of-mass energies in the range of 100 GeV to 1 TeV. At the present time, hadron colliders are the only means of reaching these energies. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>I am currently a collaborator on two collider experiments: the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) and the Atlas experiment at CERN. Both of these experiments have substantial Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory involvement. </p><p>CDF was built by a collaboration of physicists from the U.S., Japan and Italy. It has been operating at the Tevatron pbarp collider since 1987. The Tevatron produces collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 1.8 TeV, the highest energy currently available anywhere. Among the most important work done with CDF to date are the discovery of the top quark and the world\'s most precise measure ment of the W boson mass. </p><p>Both the CDF detector and the Fermilab Tevatron are scheduled to undergo major upgrades beginning in 1996. The goal of the accelerator upgrade is to increase the collision rate (luminosity) by a factor of 5-10. The experimental upgrades are designed to allow us to exploit these accelerator improvements. At Berkeley we are involved in the design and construction of a new silicon strip vertex detector for CDF. This detector will play a major role in the study of the top quark and in the search for CP non-invariance in the decay of B mesons. The upgraded CDF is expected to take data starting in Spring 1999. During the period from 1996 to 1999, we will be building the upgrades, but we will also be analyzing data taken with the existing CDF detector. The Berkeley /LBNL group\'s physics goals for the upgraded CDF are: 1) Study the properties of the top quark, including measurement of the top quark mass with a precision of ~ 4-5 GeV/c2. 2) Improve the current measurement of the W boson mass to a precision of ~ 0.05%. 3) Observe and characterize CP non-invariance in the decay of B mesons. </p><p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a pp collider with center -of-mass energy 14 TeV that is scheduled for completion in 2004. Although we are still years away from accelerator turn-on, design of the LHC experiments is underway. </p><p>The primary physics motivation for the LHC is to search for phenomena that give insight into electroweak symmetry breaking. It is this process that is believed to give mass to all elementary particles. Some possible physics signals at the LHC are: the existence of one or more fundamental scalar particles (Higgs bosons) or the presence of "supersymmetric" partners for the known elementary particles. </p><p>Berkeley/LBNL is working on the inner tracking detector for the Atlas experiment. We are currently involved in the design of the silicon strip detectors and of pixel detectors. Our work has been in the areas of high speed, radiation hard electronics and of mechanical design of modules. This project involves many serious technical channels. </p>'

S'<p>Research in our laboratory is focussed on the development of novel chemical tools to decipher signal transduction pathways on a genome-wide scale. The cellular machinery responsible for integrating complex extracellular signals from other cells is very complex. Protein phosphorylation is at the heart of these signaling cascades and is thus the most common on/off switch used in our bodies. The enzymes that catalyze protein phosphorylation are protein kinases. The major focus of our laboratory is to understand in detail the role of each kinase in the body, and determine which kinases would be good candidates for <i>drug development</i> to cure a wide range of human diseases. Specific examples of diseases we are currently working on are: <b>asthma, multiple forms of cancer, neurological disorders, bacterial infections, drug addiction, and chronic pain.</b> The main advantage of our chemical approach to these problems is that the small organic molecules we make to inhibit single kinases in whole animals are much better models of how potential drugs which target the same proteins might actually work, hopefully saving time in avoiding failed clinical trials. </p><p>We believe that small-molecule based methods for decoding cell-biology could provide information not currently accessible through solely genetic and biochemical techniques. The key problem with using small-molecules to control processes inside cells is that most often these reagents inhibit closely related enzymes with equal potency, making dissection of each individual protein impossible. Currently, small-molecules which alter the enzymatic activity or cellular localization of key biological macromolecules are derived from two sources: natural product screening (eg. Taxol, FK506, staurosporine, and others) and drug development efforts (eg. Aspirin, Raloxifine, SKB203580, and others). These two approaches require large commitments of time and resources to find even one specific inhibitor. </p><p>Our lab has developed a third method for producing these valuable reagents using an approach combining protein design and chemical synthesis. We use protein design to engineer a functionally silent yet structurally significant mutation into the active site of the protein of interest. This mutation could be the substitution of a conserved large residue in the wild-type enzyme for a smaller residue thus creating a new "pocket" in the active site. The mutant enzyme is then tested in a relevant cellular system to ensure that it functions in all aspects like the wild-type enzyme. </p><p>The next step is the initiation of a chemical design and synthesis project to modify a non-specific inhibitor of the wild-type enzyme with substituents which specifically complement the mutation introduced into the active site of the protein of interest. Substituents with the appropriate chemical functionality that bind to the newly introduced pocket are chemically appended to the origininal inhibitor structure. Importantly, the new substituent is designed to preclude binding of the inhibitor to any wild-type enzymes because they would "bump" into the large residue in the wild-type enzyme. This makes choosing a residue which is conserved in the entire protein family critical for the success of the method. </p><p>A pyrazolopyrimidine based kinase inhibitor we have identified satisfies the criteria for an inhibitor which only inhibits mutated kinases and does not inhibit any wild-type kinases we have assayed. We have most clearly demonstrated the utility of our approach in several studies of the yeast kinases CDC28 (cyclin dependent kinase 1: cell cycle), Fus3 (Map Kinase: involved in mating), Ipl1 (centrosome associate kinase), CDC15 (kinase involved in the exit from mitosis), Cla4 (Pak kinase, bud emergence), Elm1 (control of bud emergence), Ark1 (actin associated kinase 1, vescicle fusion), and a number of others are currently in progress. </p><p>The variety of kinases that our approach has been applied to already suggests to us that over 70% of the protein kinase superfamily can be suitably engineered to be sensitive to the pyrazolopyrimidine based inhibitor we have identified. The exciting aspect of this is that the pyrazolopyrimidine has ideal pharmacological properties, including good bioavailability in mice, is able to cross the blood brain barrier, crosses the yeast cell wall, and is easy to synthesize in large amounts. The inhibitor is quite potent, in that it is a &lt;5 nM inhibitor of every mutant kinase we have made. These features make our chemical genetic system very portable for studies of protein kinases in multiple model organisms including yeast, mouse, and soon C. Elegans, and the fly.</p>'

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research Interests&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Professor Siegrist has worked since the late 1980&amp;#039;s on the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking. Current work centers on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Recent physics interests include the Dark Matter searches using the ATLAS experiment, and applications of instrumentation to problems in nuclear energy, especially non-proliferation. In fall 2009, he was a part of the Berkeley Physical Sciences and Oncology Center proposal that was funded by the NCI. His work there centers on techniques for systems biology measurements related to cancer studies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Current Projects&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current ATLAS experimental program includes, among other possibilities: study of the production of candidate dark matter particles at ATLAS; study of the production and decay of the top quark, including improved techniques for top quark mass measurement; searches for unexpected new phenomena, such as Supersymmetric particles, or extra dimensions. Further information on the group&amp;#039;s activities can be found on the LBNL ATLAS home page, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www-atlas.lbl.gov&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www-atlas.lbl.gov.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other hardware activities center on further development of state-of-the-art Silicon Detectors for charged particle track reconstruction. This work involves VLSI electronics, modeling of the details of the silicon response, and understanding the behavior of silicon systems in the intense radiation environment expected at future colliders. Further information about this activity can be found on the ATLAS website listed above.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nuclear Energy studies center on the use of instrumentation and techniques originally developed for High Energy Physics in monitoring of fissile materials as part of the nuclear fission fuel cycle. This work involves simulation and modeling of nuclear fuel systems and proof-of-principle hardware projects to demonstrate detection techniques.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are now, and will continue to be, opportunities for graduate students to be involved in these activities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>Given the enormous complexity of our visual environment, the ability to selectively attend to certain locations, while ignoring others, is crucial for reducing the amount of visual information to manageable levels. Attention is one mechanism for selecting certain aspects of the environment for enhanced processing: for example, when attention is directed to a particular location in the visual field, visual perception is improved at that location. We use a combination of behavioral, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, modeling, and pharmacological techniques to characterize the neural pathways involved in the control of visual attention in humans and the effects of selective attention on processing of visual stimuli. Specifically, we are investigating the functional connectivity of sustained visual spatial attention and the neurochemical and neurophysiological substrates of voluntary and involuntary attention. Other research projects in our laboratory include the study of the neural substrates of perceptual learning, visual processing in schizophrenia, binocular rivalry, motion perception, and perceptual and neural plasticity in patients with retinal degeneration.</p>'

S'<p>The author of Imbalance of Powers: Constitutional Interpretation and the Making of American Foreign Policy (Oxford University Press, 1997) Gordon Silverstein is finishing a new book titled How Law Kills Politics which will be published in 2004 by W.W. Norton. Among other projects, he is working on developing a cross-institutional theory of precedent and a comparative study of the forces that drive different nations to adopt and accept judicial review, the first fruits of which will appear in an article titled "Globalization and the Rule of Law: \'A Machine that Runs of Itself?\' " which will appear in the Summer issue of The International Journal of Constitutional Law. </p><p>Following his undergraduate education at Cornell University where he served as Editor-in-Chief of the financially and editorially independent Cornell Daily Sun, Silverstein worked as a journalist for The Wall Street Journal in New York and Hong Kong and The San Francisco Chronicle before going to Harvard University where he earned his PhD. Before moving to Berkeley, Silverstein held faculty positions in political science, law and administrative science at Rice University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota and Lewis &amp; Clark College.In addition, he served as a Program Director for the non-profit, non-partisan New America Foundation in Washington DC. </p><p>At Berkeley, Silverstein will teach courses in constitutional law, civil liberties, comparative constitutionalism and the separation of powers among others. </p>'

S'<p>The broad goal of our research is to understand evolution in natural populations. We are especially interested in the evolutionary implications of ecological interactions between plants and other organisms, including herbivores, pathogens, and mutualists. We continue to focus on ecological and physiological trade-offs and genetic mechanisms that constrain the evolution of plant traits important to these interactions. We also apply ecological and evolutionary theory to study evolution of cooperation, plant conservation, and control of invasive species. Ongoing projects in the lab include examining: (1) mutualistic co-evolution between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, (2) effects of seed predation and herbivory on population dynamics and evolution in bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), and (3) effects of plant pathogens on plant community dynamics. Current graduate students are studying (1) tritrophic effects of metal hyperaccumulation in California native crucifers, (2) mechanisms by which lupines prevent cheating by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, (3) evolution of symbiotic genes in cyanobacteria. Past graduate students have studied patterns of symbiotic specificity of orchid-mycorrhizal interactions in Cypripedium spp., the effects of clonal reproduction on spatial patterns of alleles in orchid populations, inbreeding depression in Lobelia cardinalis, and the evolution of seed dispersal in the sand dune annual, Cakile edentula.</p>'

My published work addresses the ways opera depicts women and attitudes about gender and sexuality, the ways singers contributed creatively to shaping the operas they sang in, and how operas were staged and produced in the 19th century.    My new book tries to explain how opera was important in the movement towards the Unification of Italy in the 19th century.  In a new project I'm studying styles and ideas about producing opera in Europe and the US since 1960.</p>"

In her book, <i>Lone Pursuit: Distrust and Defensive Individualism among the Black Poor</i> (Russell Sage Foundation), Smith advances current and enduring debates about black joblessness, highlighting the role of interpersonal distrust dynamics between low-income black jobholders and their jobseeking relations that make cooperation during the process of finding work a problematic affair. In her current project, tentatively titled <i>Why Blacks Help Less</i>, Smith further interrogates the process of finding work by examining racial and ethnic differences in trust dynamics and exploring the social psychological, cultural, and structural factors that generate these differences.</p>"

S"<p>Experimental Astrophysicist George Smoot is an active researcher in  observational astrophysics and cosmology. Smoot's group at Lawrence  Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California at Berkeley  is doing experiments observing our Galaxy and the cosmic background  radiation that is remnant from the fiery beginning of our Universe.  Projects include ground-based radio-telescope observations,  balloon-borne instrumentation and satellite experiments. The most  famous of these is COBE (the NASA Cosmic Background Explorer satellite)  which has shown that the cosmic background radiation intensity has a  wavelength dependence precisely that of a perfectly absorbing body  indicating that it is the relic radiation from the Big Bang origin of  the Universe.</p><p>Using NASA's COBE DMR Smoot and his colleagues have made a map of the  early Universe discovering the seeds of present day galaxies and  clusters of galaxies. These seeds show up as variations at the part in  100,000 level in density from place to place. They also reveal  information on the Big Bang and the origin of the Universe. Members of  Dr. Smoot's group are now analyzing CMB cosmology data from the WMAP  satellite and on-going balloon experiments, Dr. Smoot has joined with  colleagues in Europe to propose and participate in  a joint European  Space Agency  and NASA satellite Max Planck Surveyor to extend and  improve these measurements. Dr. Smoot has also published a popular book  on cosmology: Wrinkles in Time.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>CMB data analysis: A major effort is data processing and analysis and  the development of new techniques and algorithms. This includes the  continuing analysis and extension of the extensive data set obtained by  the WMAP and COBE satellites. The COBE data includes four years of  observation by the DMR mapping the anisotropy in the cosmic background  radiation, four years of DIRBE data providing sky maps in wavelength  bands from 1 to 300 microns, and one year of the FIRAS observations of  the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation.WMAP provides observations of the cosmic background over 5 microwave  wavelength bands with ten times the angular resolution of COBE DMR.</p><p>Max Planck Surveyor - a new CMB anisotropy satellite: Another major  effort is the construction and preparation for data analysis for a new  satellite to measure the cosmic microwave background anisotropy with  greater angular resolution and more sensitivity than has been achieved  so far. The European Space Agency has selected Planck Surveyor as a  space mission. The subsequent development of the mission is in progress  and launch is currently scheduled for August 2007.</p><p>MAXIPOLE Balloon-borne Anisotropy and Polarization Experiment: THe  MAXIPOLE experiment has been flown twice and data analysis is in the  final stages</p><p>Search for Cosmic Strings - either Fundamental (superstrings) cosmic strings orGrand Unified Theory or end of Inflation Symmetry breaking produced strings. Eitherkind of cosmic strings would represent a sample of the Universe from a muchdifferent energy era and would reveal information about fundamental physicsunobtainable in other ways. Such cosmic strings will produce double images ofbackground sources or sharp (non-Gaussian) temperature variations in the cosmicmicrowave background.</p><p>Galactic Emission Mapping (GEM): The GEM project is aimed at measuring  and modeling Galactic millimeter to meter wave length emission and  Galactic structure. We utilize data from satellites, such as COBE, and  ground-based observations in our Galactic modeling. As a major  component of the program we have developed a precise, controlled radio  dish instrument and receivers which are used to make and calibrate  radio maps of the sky. The GEM instrumentation has operated from a  remote site in California, in Colombia, Tenerife (the Canary Islands)  and is currently operating from Brazil.</p><p>Various students in the group are working on gravitational lensing  (strong and weak) and related supernovae detection and observation as  part of theeffort to study dark matter and dark energy and its impact  in cosmology. Dr. Smoot is participating in the JDEM (SNAP) effort to  define a space mission too study dark energy.</p><p>KM-SCALE Neutrino Detector: A group has formed to develop of a km-scale  (square or cubic) neutrino detector now named IceCube. The size is  needed to detect astrophysical neutrinos at very high energies (10^12 -  10^17 eV). Simulations, electronics, detector, and deployment are key  technical aspects of the development effort for this detector.</p>"

S'<p>The research program in my lab is largely directed toward understanding how plant cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized, how the structures relate to the functions of the cell wall, and how the system is regulated. I envision that knowledge of cell wall structure and function will facilitate the development of plants with improved utility as sources of renewable materials and as biofuel feedstocks.  A major focus of work in the lab is in understanding how cellulose is made. We have developed plants in which cellulose synthase is modified in various ways that facilitate functional studies. One type of modification is the addition of yellow fluorescent protein to subunits of the complex. This allows imaging of the complexes in live cells. We have used this capability to show that an interaction between cellulose synthase and cortical microtubules controls the orientation of cellulose deposition. We are engaged in understanding what regulates the amount of cellulose and the properties of cellulose microfibrils (eg., length and diameter). We have also developed plants that express cellulose synthases with other modifications that will facilitate structural studies of isolated complexes.</p>'

S"<p>Professor Somorjai's research interests are in the field of surface science. His group is studying the structure, bonding, and reactivity at solid surfaces on the <br />molecular scale. This knowledge is then utilized to understand macroscopic surface phenomena adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, friction, lubrication, and biocompatibility on the molecular level. To this end, research is carried out in the following areas:  <br /><br /> a) Studies of the structure and bonding of adsorbed monolayers of molecules on the surfaces of solids by sum frequency generation surface vibrational <br />spectroscopy, scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies, and electron spectroscopies. Work is concentrated on transition metal single-crystal and polymer surfaces, and on surface structures of biomolecules (amino acids, peptides) monolayers on these surfaces.  <br /><br /> b) Studies of catalytic reactions on single crystals, nano-particles, or other well characterized surfaces. The rate and product distribution of catalyzed reactions are correlated to surface composition, valency, and atomic structure. As part of these studies, we investigate hydrocarbon reactions on platinum,&nbsp; nickel and rhodium.  <br /><br /> Most research projects utilize single-crystal surfaces,  nano-particles produced by colloid science techniques and as  2-dimensional films or 3-dimensional structures using mezoporous oxides.  Extensive use is made of ultrahigh vacuum techniques. Chemical surface reactions are monitored by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We always attempt to study the surface on the molecular scale under reaction conditions.</p>"

S'<p>Interest in the Stacy Lab is in solid-state inorganic chemistry, with particular emphasis on the synthesis and characterization of new solid state materials with novel electronic and magnetic properties.  We are able to make new materials, or grow crystals of materials that have previously only been made at high temperatures, by choosing unusual reaction conditions.  Our goal is to exploit changes in chemical composition or size in order to tailor structural parameters and physical properties.</p><p>A main theme in the Stacy Lab is the development of new synthetic methodologies, including the use of molten salts for the synthesis of oxide superconductors, electrodeposition (in aqueous solutions and molten salts) for the synthesis of thermoelectric materials, and the use of plasma-solid reactions for the synthesis of fluorides with interesting catalytic properties.  We are also using our plasma chamber for the development of chemistries for emission reduction of perfluorocarbon compounds produced by plasma processing of semiconductor devices.  A current interest in our lab is exploring two-dimensional and one-dimensional quantum confined thermoelectric materials.  These materials are made by electrodeposition through a porous membrane to produce wires and by pulsed laser deposition to produce multilayered thin films.  In each of these cases we are learning about an unusual or new synthetic approach in order to target a material in which we are interested.</p><p>It is important to us that we understand the behavior of our materials, as well as the conditions of our syntheses so we can more carefully control which products we get.  For the oxides, we have been exploring the use of Raman spectroscopy to characterize the chemistry of the molten alkali metal hydroxides that we use as a solvent system.  A new project in our lab has focused on the transport properties of mixed metal chalcoplyrites (such as CuInSe2).  We are systematically doping with Zn to see which affects the transport properties more, the dopant or the defects.  We are using diffraction and electron microscopy to characterize this system.</p><p>As chemists interested in solids, an important contribution is to discover advanced materials that can be applied to emerging technologies.  In addition, we have the fun of deciphering new and unusual behavior of materials.</p>'

S'<p>The developing field of ultracold atomic physics provides tantalizing opportunities for exploring physical phenomena in a regime that has heretofore been inaccessible: material systems with temperatures in the nanokelvin range (and below), with broadly and instantly tunable interactions, residing in dynamically adaptable containers, and amenable to the precise manipulation and detection tools of atomic physics.  My research has focused on developing further capabilities in this field, and utilizing these advances to study many-body quantum physics, to explore the "coherent optics" and "quantum optics" of matter waves, to realize novel consequences of light-atom interactions, and to perform precision measurements of scientific and technological importance.</p><p>My present research proceeds in three directions.  One focuses on creating and studying novel quantum fluids, and also in realizing model systems for the study of quantum magnetism.  Here, we have developed a microscopy technique to directly image the magnetization of a spin-1 Bose gas.  Using this technique, we have identified quantum phase transitions and instances of spontaneous symmetry breaking, characterized a near-quantum-limited parametric spin amplifier, uncovered dynamical signatures of long-range interactions, and observed equilibration and coarsening behavior in a ferromagnetic superfluid.  We are also studying the impact of geometric frustration on orbital and spin physics of quantum systems, realized by confining cold atoms in a kagome-geometry lattice potential.</p><p>A second research direction focuses on the collective motion and spin dynamics of atoms trapped in optical resonators, using effects of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) to measure quantum properties of matter-wave systems. We have contributed to the development of cavity optomechanics, making the first observations of ponderomotive squeezing and the quantization of collective motion of an atomic gas.  Such advances relate to optomechanical detectors of gravity waves or other weak forces.  The dynamics of atomic spins with resonators has allowed us to perform magnetic resonance imaging of a cold atomic gas with 100 nm spatial resolution.</p><p>Our third research effort is directed toward realizing atom interferometers capable of making precise measurements of scientific and/or technological importance.  Here, we are studying ways to implement Sagnac interferometry in a cold-atoms-based gyroscope, making use of superfluid properties of the trapped gas.</p><p>My research agenda continues to evolve and to involve new students, postdocs, and visitors. If you are interested in our work, or interested in joining us, please contact us.</p>'

A large detector filled with liquid  scintillator, located deep underground in the Kamioka mine in Japan,  is used to study the interactions of antineutrinos produced in nuclear  reactors that are typically about 200 km away.  Evidence for  oscillations has been obtained by noting that the observed rate of  antineutrino interactions is less than the expected rate, and also  that the shape of the energy spectrum is distorted from the spectrum  that would be produced if there are no oscillations.  The results give  clear evidence that antineutrinos have mass.  The KamLAND experiment  is expected to continue for several more years, and a subsequent study  of low-energy solar neutrinos is presently in preparation.  The  Berkeley group participates in all aspects of  this work, and has  primary responsibility for the calibration of the detector and in data  analysis.</p>'

S'<p>My research is centrally concerned with the role of language and  literacy practices in children\xe2\x80\x99s development and education. Merging my  graduate degree training in developmental psychology (Ph.D., 2002) and  in applied linguistics (Ph.D., 2004), I have developed a research  program that explores the intricate interplay between culture and  cognition in the acquisition of language and literacy competence.  <br /><br />I also study the communication of and with children with autism.  This line of inquiry is linked to my more general interest in discerning  the cognitive and socio-cultural underpinnings of communicative  competence. Autism is a disorder that impacts with differing degrees of  severity social interaction and communication. In its severe  manifestations autism is associated with mental retardation and the  absence of language development. High-functioning affected children, on  the other hand, develop language and have normal to superior  intelligence. The particular configurations of competencies and  difficulties that children with autism manifest define a rich matrix for  understanding the foundations of communication and discerning with  increased accuracy and precision the building blocks of communicative  competence.</p>'

S"<p>A licensed German landscape architect, Judith Stilgenbauer joined the Berkeley faculty in 2003 as a landscape designer and as the plant material expert in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning. Prior to coming to the United States she headed the Munich office of the Rainer Schmidt Landscape Architecture firm, where she played a lead role in award-winning design competitions and numerous realized urban landscape designs and green infrastructure schemes and implementations, including green roofs, as well as master-planning and large-scale landscape architecture exposition projects. In 2006, she founded her own practice STILGENBAUER \xe2\x80&#148; landschaftsarchitekten in Oakland, California. <br /><br /> Focused on issues of urban public space design, Stilgenbauer's creative work is defined by her intent to communicate a sense of space and time, to be process-driven (as in Prozesshaftigkeit), yet simultaneously visual and structural. Her designs seek an honest and clear gestalt that transcends the picturesque or ornamental while striving for a project-appropriate balance between changing and stable elements, the latter typically providing a project\xe2\x80\x99s spatial framework. Stilgenbauer attempts to create post-static design solutions that evolve, making natural processes tangible, and that are performative (problem-solving and/or productive) as well as useable, enjoyable, and memorable. Her work takes into consideration aesthetic and spatial as well as ecological, cultural, and social aspects of landscape design.</p>"

We study a broad diversity of marine organisms, including porcelain crabs, corals, coccolithophores, and clams. Our research blends in vivo physiology, such as cardiac activity or metabolic rate, with protein biochemistry, including proteomics, enzymology and protein structure-function relationships, and we use functional genomics, specifically transcriptome profiling using cDNA microarrays and RNA-seq, to elucidate the mechanistic bases for physiological plasticity and diversity.</p><p>Projects currently underway in our laboratory are focused on understanding how porcelain crabs, king crabs, and coccolithophores respond to ocean acidification, examination of the combined effects of ocean acidification with other environmental drives such as temperature and nutrients in crabs and coccolithophores, study of the effects of environmental variability on an invasive clam in San Francisco Bay, and in the near future we will begin to examine the effects of climate change on aquatic insects.</p>'

S"<p>I am interested in experiments using elementary particles to test discrete symmetries, absolute predictions and other fundamental tenets of the Standard Model. Completed examples include early measurement of the parameters describing charge parity (CP) nonconservation in K meson decay; establishment of upper limits on the quark charge radius and early observation of the effects of gluon radiation in deep inelastic muon scattering; and establishment of stringent limits on right-handed charged currents both in muon decay and in proton-antiproton collisions, the latter via the search for production of right-handed W bosons in the D-Zero experiment at Fermilab. The Standard Model requires the b quark to have an isospin partner, which in D-Zero we observed in 1995 as the top quark. By 1997 we had measured its mass to 4.5% accuracy. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The top quark is uniquely massive; careful study of it perhaps will uncover clues to the origin of mass (electroweak symmetry breaking), which is not yet understood. Indirectly, the exact W and top quark mass values fix the scale at which this symmetry is broken. </p><p>One line of research is to compare the masses of the top quark as measured in different decay channels. Top quarks are produced mostly in pairs; each decays primarily to b + W. The b's appear as jets of hadrons. Each W decays to a pair of jets or to a lepton and neutrino. For top mass measurement the most important channels are those in which either one or both of the W's decay leptonically. For the single-lepton final states, we developed in 1994-96 and applied in 1997 a new technique that suppresses the backgrounds (from single W production or jets misidentified as leptons) by half an order of magnitude without biasing the apparent top mass spectra either of signal or of background. For the dilepton final states, where backgrounds are lower but two final-state neutrinos are undetected rather than one, a likelihood vs. top mass must be calculated for each event. In 1993-96 we developed a new prescription for this calculation that takes into account the density of states; in 1997 we used it to measure the top mass to 7% accuracy in this more sparsely populated channel. </p><p>If, as now seems likely, the top quark is a Standard Model particle, the same top quark mass should be obtained while the methods for determining it are varied. To make these measurements and tests more incisive, in addition to accumulating more data we must continue to develop analysis techniques such as those mentioned above; further radical improvements may be possible. </p><p>Another line of research is to search for nonstandard decays of the top quark, including decays to its possible supersymmetric partner. In many supersymmetric models, R-parity conservation requires every superparticle to decay eventually to a lightest superparticle (LSP) that, like the neutrino, can be observed only by measuring an imbalance in the event's transverse momentum. Reliable detection of such an imbalance is one of the severest challenges for collider detectors. D-Zero's uniform and highly segmented uranium/liquid argon calorimeter provides the best such detection achieved so far. Building on that, we have developed a new plan for decisive improvement in LSP analysis, which we are now implementing. </p><p>All of the work described above continues to exploit the rich sample of D-Zero data collected between 1992 and 1996, at beam luminosities up to 10 times the level we had originally anticipated. (Fermilab has been unique among the world's high energy laboratories in consistently exceeding its accelerator performance specifications.) To further extend the sensitivity of the D-Zero sample by a factor of at least 20, we have been engaged in a vigorous detector upgrade program since 1990, aimed toward a run beginning in 2000. We have been involved closely with the upgrade concept and the detailed design of the new silicon vertex detector. The associated LBL group has responsibilities in design and implementation of the silicon readout system and the algorithms and codes that will be used to exploit it. </p>"

S'<p>My research in historical archaeology includes complementary lines of evidence of varied types and spatial scales. These include analysis of archaeological ceramic and faunal assemblages related to domestic foodways and GIS analysis of remote sensing, survey, and excavation data to reveal tactical, engineering, and ritual patterning of cultural landscapes. By placing these suites of data in dialogue with each other, I seek more robust explanations of the ways that communities expressed various aspects of their identities in different contexts and scales of social performance. Primary to such research is the study of systems of cross-cultural contact and the way they operated in structuring and mitigating social and ethnic boundaries during the proto-historic and colonial periods. Related to these research foci are the relationships between colonization and the historical transformation of indigenous landscape, foodways, and identity. As an archaeologist, I am especially interested in the potential for examining these issues through the analysis of material culture and technology.</p>'

S'<p><i><b>Magnetics:</b></i>, The research area of magnetics- both in fundamental science and device physics- has enabled the magnetic storage industry to continue to make significant technological advances. As miniaturization reaches its limit, new paradigms for information storage and transfer based on fundamentally new phenomena or new materials are necessary. My approach to research has been to develop new classes of magnetic oxide thin film materials (1) to understand the structure-property relationships of these novel materials, (2) to develop a fundamental understanding of magnetism at nanometer length scales in complex materials and (3) to fabricate spin devices based on these materials. A strong motivation for research in the nanometer regime is that magnetism at these length scales may be dominated by processes that are very different from those at macroscopic length scales. These processes may shed light on novel magnetic phenomena and have profound implications for the future of magnetic storage applications. The scienctific themes of my research currently include the development of new magnetic materials, new techniques for the formation of nanostructures and spin based devices. </p><p><i><b>Photonics:</b></i>, Through dielectric constant modulation, photonic bandgap crystals offer control of light propagation by the introduction of gaps in the density of electromagnetic states, analogous to energy bandgaps for electrons in a crystal lattice. Since photons offer greater speed, more information per unit time, and wider bandwidth compared with electrons, it is not surprising that optical components have found their way into semiconductor technology. However, the absence of an all-purpose optical component similar to the transistor in semiconductor electronics has prevented the revolutionary step toward an all-optical technology. To provide the building blocks for an optical analog of a transistor, many researchers have focused their efforts on fabricating photonic bandgap crystals. We are studying microphotonic structures that are predicted to give rise to a bandgap in the near infrared region. </p>'

S"<p>I study various consequences of the Standard Model of electroweak interaction. For more fundamental issues, I explore for a new breaking mechanism of the electroweak symmetry. The recent CERN precision measurement has been narrowing a room for such an alternative. I place an emphasis on physics which can be tested at present or will be probed by experiment in the near future. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The following are the works that have continued for the past five years. </p><p>Electroweak symmetry breaking and physics at the TeV energy scale: The minimal Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory because of its highly unnatural Higgs sector. As an extension of the Standard Model which remedies unnaturalness, supersymmetry and the Technicolor model have been the most popular candidates. The top condensation is another idea. These ideas can be put together. The new ideas which have emerged include a new supersymmetry breaking model at intermediate scales and the duality approach to supersymmetric theories. I will look for more alternatives by selecting their attractive features and studying possible phenomenological consequence. </p><p>Heavy quark symmetry: The static quark symmetry of SU(6) of the light quarks in the 1960's was recently revived for study of heavy quarks. The contemporary approach has made one important progress, that is, QCD-loop corrections. Before the recent revival, I built a model of semileptonic D and B decays which incorporates this symmetry. More recently we gave a simple derivation of a nonrenormalization theorem. As the B factory is being built at SLAC, I will refocus on heavy quark physics. </p><p>B meson physics: The heavy mesons made of the b-quark are of particular interest to test the Standard Model through CP violation phenomena. Major efforts have been made for measurement of the B meson decay. Except for the neutral B meson mixing effect, however, the analysis of CP violations will be severely compromised unless we have a reasonable understanding of the final-state rescattering. At present no quantitative theory exists for the long-distance strong interactions in the final states. I shall continue my present work in the long-distance final-state interaction in the B decay toward the goal of obtaining a quantitative understanding of this physics. </p><p>Disoriented chiral condensate: In chromodynamics infinitely many candidates of vacuum are degenerate with the true vacuum in the limit of chiral symmetry. Such states are called the disoriented chiral condensates. It is speculated that these metastable vacua will be produced for a short period of time in high-energy collisions. This field is still in its infancy and there are many works that can be done. </p>"

S"My research aspires to advance our understanding of the roles played by two central institutions ---firms and contractual agreements---and how these institutions facilitate the creation of surplus. Within the broader framework of the role of firms and contracts, I have focused on four main research topics. First, what causes a firm's reputation to be a valuable, tradeable asset, and how does it affect the behavior of individuals in the firm? Second, how does organizational form affect firm behavior, in particular, what role do profit sharing partnerships perform? Third, which characteristics of a procurement transaction will influence the choice of contractual form that a buyer should devise? Finally, my work on private sector procurement has led me to investigate the determinants of public sector procurement, and explore the public policy implications of efficient procurement by local governments."

S'<p>We study <i>Drosophila</i> mutants that have behavioral abnormalities. By determining the genetic and molecular bases of these abnormalities, we are able to unravel new and basic features of nervous system structure and function.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Our approach is to use a combination of methodologies including classical and molecular genetics, behavior, electrophysiology, and neuroanatomy. We are especially interested in developing a Drosophila model system for examining human neuropathologies. Recently, we have been examining seizures, a serious problem in many neuropathologies. They are a major symptom associated with fever, mechanical trauma, electroconvulsive shock, drugs, alcohol, tumors and epilepsy. The long-term objectives of our research are to examine basic nervous system features underlying seizure-sensitivity and to discover novel treatments. </p><p>To approach this problem, we have a) invented methods for quantifying seizure-susceptibility in normal and mutant Drosophila; b) identified seizure-sensitive mutants that are especially prone to seizures compared with normal flies; c) identified seizure-resistant mutants that are especially insensitive to seizure-induction; and d) identified seizure-suppressor mutations and seizure-enhancer mutations that allow further genetic manipulation of seizure phenotypes and form the basis for developing promising anticonvulsant therapies. The genetic and molecular biology capabilities in Drosophila that have resolved fundamentally important issues in biology also provide an attractive system for developing new therapies to treat human pathobiology.</p>'

It  has led to an ongoing fascination with the work of writers such as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mar\xc3\xada  Arguedas, Jes\xc3\xbas Lara, and Rosario Castellanos. My book, Intimate  Indigenismo: The Inner Life of Mestizo Nationalism (University of Minnesota Press, 2008), examines how these authors and  others created an autobiographical indigenista literary aesthetic in the  mid-twentieth century that attempted to challenge existing racial hierarchies and  reflected a new concept of national subjectivity. I have also been interested in the  literary practice of Quechua-Spanish translation in Peru and Bolivia, and have  undertaken many years of Quechua language study. My current research concerns the use of the Holocaust in Latin America to describe state violence, colonialism and slavery. I have also published in the area of French Caribbean literature and post-colonial studies.</p>'

Her main areas of research are the Habsburg court society in the early modern period, the development of the German language at the end of the Middle Ages and the Middle High German narrative tradition. Her teaching at Berkeley has been concerned primarily with the literary and cultural traditions of the Holy Roman Empire in the medieval and early modern periods, although she occasionally teaches courses on modern subjects as well. Recently she has offered seminars on women in courtly literature and society, the German experience of the Crusades, a Townsend Center interdisciplinary seminar with Professor Thomas Brady (History) on genres of social discourse in early modern Germany, and a Center for German and European Studies Seminar with Professors Thomas Brady and Horst Wenzel (Germanistik, Humboldt Universit\xc3\xa4t, Berlin) on modes of pre-modern German historiography. She has performed a variety of administrative tasks on campus, including the chairmanship of the Scandinavian Department 1989-92, 1995, and 2001-2002. Professor Tennant's publications include a monograph on the emergence of the German common language (1985), a study of vocalism in sixteenth-century German primers (1981), and essays on Gottfried's Tristan, gender interactions in the Nibelungenlied, the relationship between verbal and visual culture in early modern Germany, New Historicism, intellectual property etc. Her current projects include research on the reception of the Theuerdank, notions of intellectual property in early modern Germany, and earliest European reactions to the discovery of Mexico.</p>"

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The long-term goal of our research is to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of complex sounds such as speech or animal communications. We also study how early sensory experience affects such neural processing and consequently how experience affects the ability of animals and humans to perceive behaviorally important sounds. We do most of our neurobiological research on songbirds because they offer a unique opportunity to study the perception of complex sounds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Songbirds are very vocal and use many different sounds in different behavioral contexts. One of the most striking vocalizations is the song that the male bird uses in courtship and territorial defense. Male songbirds learn to sing and this learning behavior is critically dependent on a sensory phase during which the young birds must recognize and memorize the song of a tutor. In this respect song learning is similar to speech learning in human infants. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By understanding how songs and other complex natural sounds are represented in the auditory system of songbirds, we hope to advance our understanding of how the mammalian auditory cortex processes complex sounds such as speech and how the neural circuitry underlying this processing develops in infancy. Our laboratory is also interested in animal communication, statistics of natural sounds, speech perception and computational issues in systems neuroscience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S'<p>Sustainable land and water management in the face of global change is one of the critical challenges confronting environmental sciences.  At almost all scales, the earth-system is characterized by high dimensionality, nonlinearity and process-interdependency, so that changes in one component can propagate between different processes in complex ways.  Thus, predicting ecological, hydrological and geophysical responses in the face of global climate and land-use change, as required to ensure sustainable management, remains one of the grand scientific challenges of our times.   My scientific goals lie in using self-organized or optimized components of hydrological systems, particularly as they relate to the distribution and water use by vegetation, to address the complex interactions between water, and its spatial and temporal distribution on the landscape, and ecosystems.  Where self-organization occurs, emergent patterns may act as both signatures and drivers of the system, and offer a tractable approach to reduce the dimensionality and increase the tractability of prediction.  I am particularly interested in applying these approaches to understanding the drivers of the distribution of vegetation (and related ecological processes) at landscape and watershed scales, and in using observations of such spatial distribution as indicators of ecosystem resilience and hydrological responses.  My research expertise lies in the combined use of field, remote-sensing and modeling techniques to describe the spatial evolution of vegetation cover in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>'

S'<p>Transmembrane and intracellular signal transduction mechanisms are the  focus of our group, especially understanding how extracellular stimuli  control gene expression, cell growth, cell morphology, and cell division  at the biochemical level. <br /><br /><b>Current Projects</b><br /><br />Structural analysis of a peptide hormone receptor. To understand the  molecular biology of peptide hormone action, we study response of  budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to its peptide mating  pheromones (alpha-factor and a-factor). The pheromone receptors have  seven hydrophobic segments and are coupled to a heterotrimeric G  protein. Receptors of this type are ubiquitous and transduce binding of a  wide variety of extracellular ligands (peptide hormones,  neurotransmitters and other bioactive compounds) into a physiological  signal. Attempts to determine the three-dimensional structure of the  purified alpha-factor receptor by NMR are underway in collaborative  studies. We are also interested in proteins involved in adaptation and  recovery after the pheromone-induced signal. <br /><br /> Molecular genetics and biochemistry of a protein kinase cascade.  Activation of the receptor-coupled G protein initiates a cascade of  three protein kinases, resulting in stimulation of two  messenger-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the nucleus. A different  developmental pathway (invasive or filamentous growth) triggered by  nutrient limitation also stimulates these MAPKs. MAPK cascades are  universally employed for signal transduction in eukaryotic cells, and  every eukaryotic cell contains multiple MAPK pathways. We are  investigating the mechanisms that impose specificity and fidelity at  each tier in these signaling networks. We showed that one device used by  the cell for discrimination between parallel MAPK pathways is a  specific docking interaction between a MAPK and the N-terminus of its  cognate upstream protein kinase (MEK). We also showed that a scaffold  protein helps ensure signaling fidelity in pheromone response by binding  the appropriate MAPK, MEK, and upstream activating kinase (MEKK) and by  shuttling from the nucleus to the plasma membrane and delivering the  MAPK module to its most proximal activator (a fourth membrane-associated  protein kinase). A different scaffold protein is required for signal  propagation in the invasive growth pathway and is also under study. <br /><br />Control of gene expression. We used genetic and biochemical methods  to demonstrate that two negative transcriptional regulators are  substrates of the MAPKs. How the function of these targets is modified  by phosphorylation is under study. We also discovered a general  regulator of transcription, which has homologs in Drosophila and human  cells, that catalyzes ATP-dependent dissociation of TATA box-binding  protein (TBP)-DNA complexes. Structural analysis of the mechanism of  action of this global transcriptional regulator is in progress. <br /><br /> Protein kinases involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and  cell cycle control. The function of the Wee1 class of protein-tyrosine  kinase in cell cycle control is not well understood. We are  investigating pathways that regulate the activity, localization, and  stability of this enzyme, including its recruitment to septin filaments,  which assemble at the presumptive site of cell division. A cascade of  protein kinases involved in stress response that is conserved from yeast  to humans is also under study. <br /><br />Molecular biology of phosphoinositide-dependent signaling. In  previous work, we have shown that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate  generated by a specific phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has a specific  role in the Golgi-to-plasma membrane stage of the secretory pathway.  This enzyme also has an essential role in supplying the PtdIns(4)P that  is converted to PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the nucleus, where it is hydrolyzed by a  specific phospholipase C to generate inositol polyphosphates that  regulate transcription and mRNA export. We found that the  phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase is also regulated by a small  calcium-binding protein. <br /><br />Novel mechanisms for translocation across membranes. We discovered  that export of a-factor pheromone requires an integral plasma membrane  protein that is a dedicated ATP-dependent transporter, rather than the  classical secretory pathway. The mechanism of transmembrane  translocation of pheromone by the transporter is being examined. The  functions of other members of the same transporter class are also under  study.</p>'

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The research projects in Professor Tilley&amp;#039;s group involve exploratory synthetic, structural, and reactivity studies on novel inorganic systems. Reactivity studies focus on new compounds that exhibit unusual electronic and/or coordination environments for the metal center. Mechanistic investigations are often undertaken to define reactivity patterns for these new species. Metal-mediated routes to new polymers are being explored, and molecular, chemical approaches to the designed construction of advanced solid state materials and heterogeneous catalysts are being developed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research in organometallic chemistry involves the synthesis of transition metal complexes that exhibit new chemical properties, often via the design and introduction of new ancillary ligands. For example, chelating, nitrogen-based ligands are being explored in attempts to obtain early transition metal complexes that efficiently activate the bonds of substrate molecules (via &amp;quot;sigma-bond metathesis&amp;quot;). Along these lines, mechanistic studies are helping to shed light on possible pathways to facile reactions of various bonds (e.g., C-H, Si-H, C-Si, P-H, B-H, etc.). A second interest concerns the activation of bonds via 1,2-migrations between a metal and a donor atom. This reaction type has been developed, for example, to activate both Si-H bonds of secondary silanes to produce silylene dihydride complexes of Pt, Ir, Os, and W. Efforts are underway to incorporate the new reactivity patterns that have been discovered into catalytic cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The program in polymer synthesis involves use of coordination polymerizations with transition-metal complexes to develop new methods for polymerizations involving alkene, alkyne, silane, and/or stannane monomers. A particular emphasis is placed on development of electron-delocalized polymers, which show great promise as advanced materials that function as conductors, semiconductors, photoconductors, nonlinear optical materials, photochromic materials, and light-emitting materials. Metal-catalyzed dehydropolymerizations have been used to obtain the first high molecular weight polystannanes. These low band-gap polymers are semiconducting when doped, and display interesting temperature-dependent optical properties. An approach to new pi-conjugated structures is based on zirconocene-coupling of diynes to polymers with metallacycle units in the main chain. The zirconacyclopentadiene residues provide versatile chemical pathways for placement of a variety of conjugated groups (dienes, aromatic heterocycles) into a delocalized chain. A related topic is based on the discovery that zirconocene-coupling methods are extremely useful in high-yield syntheses of macrocycles from readily-available diynes. This method is being used to produce macrocycles of various sizes, shapes, and functionalities. Applications in host-guest chemistry, catalysis, anion-binding, and supramolecular chemistry are being developed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A project on the molecular design and synthesis of solid-state materials targets the development of chemical routes to complex, 3-dimensional networks via molecular-level control. Primary targets are oxide-based materials, which are fabricated from tailored, oxygen-rich precursor molecules. Such compounds undergo mild elimination reactions (of alkenes and water) to give homogeneous, mixed-element oxides. This method has recently been modified to produce multi-component, mesoporous solids. A strong emphasis is on use of this approach to provide new generations of catalysts for important reactions such as selective hydrocarbon oxidations (for example, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes). A second molecular chemical approach makes use of dendrimeric building blocks to generate hybrid organic-inorganic materials with tailored porosities and functionalities. In general, the goal of the research in this area is to provide designed materials possessing new and specific structural, electronic, optical, and/or catalytic properties.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;'

S"<p>The sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid determines its structure and function; Professor Tinoco and his students want to deduce these fundamental properties from the sequence. Important questions are: What folded, base-paired structure of an RNA is specified by the sequence? How do RNA loops interact with each other, or with double-stranded regions to form compact three-dimensional structures? What proteins, drugs, and ions do these structures bind? How do the sequence and structure affect the functions of ribosomal RNA's, the sites of processing of RNA, the translation of messenger RNA's, the replication of RNA viruses, and the catalytic abilities of RNA enzymes?      The methods that are being used to answer these questions include:</p><ol><li>Single-molecule measurements of the forces required to unfold RNA molecules using laser tweezers.</li><li>Measurements of the kinetics of unfolding and refolding RNA as a function of force.</li><li>Study of translation of a single messenger RNA by a single ribosome. The lifetimes of each step in the translation process are determined as a function of messenger RNA sequence and structure, concentrations of antibiotics, and force.</li></ol>"

S'<p>Biochemistry of Transcription and Chromatin Transactions: Over the past 20 years, our lab has identified, isolated and characterized a large number (~100) of essential drosophila and human transcription factors. These regulatory proteins include enhancer/promoter recognition factors, core RNA pol II initiation factors and co-activators that form large multi-subunit complexes at promoter DNA to mediate transcription initiation and decode the genome. Our studies indicate that large co-activator complexes play a critical role in mediating both universal as well as cell type specific networks of gene transcription and can serve as the interface between transcription and chromatin regulation. Although our earlier studies focused on in vitro biochemistry and conventional molecular genetics approaches, our recent research is directed at the more challenging task of integrating specific molecular transactions with in vivo mechanisms in cells and organisms under physiological conditions.</p><p>Single Cell Biochemistry, Structural Biology and Single Molecule Measurements: In order to address mechanisms of transcriptional control we use a combination of structural biological methods such as cryo EM/3D particle reconstruction, X-ray crystallography and single molecule measurements. Another effort is to develop strategies for measuring the assembly and movement of transcription complexes at the single cell level. These studies aim to track the movement and function of target transcription factors in live cells by various optical methods. In addition, we continue to utilize tools such as siRNA mediated knockdown of transcription factors as well as in vitro reconstitution of regulated transcription to link specific molecular mechanisms of control with in vivo physiology.</p><p>Transcription Mechanisms in Stem Cell Pluripotency and Differentiation:  Deciphering the molecular basis of pluripotency is fundamental to our understanding of development and embryonic stem (ES) cell function.  Using techniques such as ChIP-sequence analysis, systematic RNAi mutagenesis, transgenic animals or cells, and in vitro transcription assays, we have developed complimentary experimental strategies to dissect in vivo mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and tease out how these various protein/DNA and protein/protein transactions influence gene expression.  We recently found that TAF3, a TBP-associated core promoter factor, is highly enriched in ES cells,  where it is required for endoderm lineage differentiation and prevents premature specification of neuroectoderm and mesoderm. In addition to its role in the core promoter recognition complex TFIID, genome-wide binding studies reveal that TAF3 localizes to chromosomal regions bound by CTCF and cohesin. Enrichment for TAF3/CTCF/cohesin bound regions distinguishes TAF3-activated from TAF3-repressed genes. Notably, CTCF directly interacts with and recruits TAF3 to promoter distal sites and TAF3-dependent DNA looping is observed between the promoter distal sites and core promoters occupied by TAF3/CTCF/cohesin. Our findings thus support a new role of TAF3 in mediating long-range chromatin regulatory interactions to safeguard the finely balanced transcriptional programs that give rise to pluripotency.</p><p>In a related set of experiments, we have studied how the transcriptional activators Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog cooperate with a wide array of cofactors to orchestrate an ES cell-specific gene expression program that forms the molecular basis of pluripotency.   We have used an unbiased in vitro transcription-biochemical complementation assay to discover a multi-subunit stem cell coactivator complex (SCC) that is selectively required for the synergistic activation of the Nanog gene by Oct4 and Sox2. Purification, identification and reconstitution of SCC revealed this coactivator to be the trimeric XPC-nucleotide excision repair complex. SCC interacts directly with Oct4 and Sox2 and is recruited to the Nanog and Oct4 promoters as well as a majority of genomic regions that are occupied by Oct4 and Sox2.   Depletion of SCC/XPC compromised both pluripotency in ES cells and somatic cell reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells, illustrating its diversified functions in maintaining ES cell pluripotency and safeguarding genome integrity.</p>'

S'<p>Nelson Maldonado-Torres (2003) earned his B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Puerto Rico in 1994, and his Ph.D. (2002) in Religious Studies from Brown University.  He specializes in phenomenology, critical theory, postcolonial studies, and modern religious thought.  He is interested in theories of decolonization as they emerge in different contexts and from different subjective positions in the Americas.   Dr. Maldonado has done a considerable amount of work on Africana, Jewish, and Latin American intellectual productions.  He is currently working on a theory of epistemic and material decolonization based on Fanon\'s work and on the theoretical production of U.S. feminists of color.  This work encompasses reflections on religion, philosophical anthropology, social and cultural formations in the Americas, and the role of critical intellectual activity in the context of global coloniality.  Dr. Maldonado\'s publications include, among others, "La antropolog\xc3\xada filos\xc3\xb3fica de Emmanuel L\xc3\xa9vinas" [Emmanuel Levinas\'s Philosophical Anthropology], <i>Intersticios</i> (Mexico) 5.10 (1999); "The Cry of the Self as a Call from the Other: The Paradoxical Loving Subjectivity of Frantz Fanon," <i>Listening: Journal of Religion and Culture</i> (Winter 2001); and "Postimperial Reflections on Crisis, Knowledge, and Utopia: Transgresstopic Critical Hermeneutics and the \'Death of European Man.\'"  Review 25.3 (2002).</p>'

S'<p>Research in my group is primarily aimed toward the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions and methods for organic synthesis. Ultimately, we are interested in using these methods to address problems in the synthesis of complex molecules possessing interesting structural, biological and physical properties. As such, our research program spans the areas of organic synthesis, catalysis, and organometallic chemistry.</p><p>Two mechanistically distinct applications of complexes with metal-ligand multiple bonds are illustrative of our approach. First, we envision a new approach to catalysis utilizing transition metal-ligand pi-bonds to activate sigma-bonds towards addition reactions. We are also examining metal-ligand and ancillary ligand combinations with the ultimate goal of developing enantioselective versions of these reactions. The concept of employing complexes containing metal-ligand multiple bonds as bifunctional catalysts for sigma-bond activation represents a dramatic shift from the traditional applications of metal-oxo complexes as catalysts for atom transfer (epoxidations, aziridinations and dihydroxylation) and for functional group oxidations. Second, we are developing metal-dioxo complexes as catalysts for three-component cycloadditions in which the oxo ligand is one of the partners. We are applying these cycloaddition reactions to the synthesis of natural products such as kallolide A (anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties).</p><p>A second area of research is the development of new catalysts and synthetic methods for the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. Of particular interest are addition reactions including additions to olefins and alkynes, alkene-alkene coupling and other atom transfer additions. For example, we are investigating catalytic methods for the addition of water and alcohols to enones as an alternative entry into aldol adducts. Our ultimate goal is to develop enantioselective variants of these reactions and utilize them in the synthesis of natural products such as epoxyquinol (antiangiogenic activity), the eudesmanolides (antitumor) and the amphidinolides (cytotoxic).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'

S'<p>I am interested in astrophysics very broadly. However, my primary research at present involves very high angular resolution astronomy in the mid-infrared (10 micron region) by use of interferometric techniques. Three1.65 meter telescopes mounted in trailers have been constructed so that interferometry can be carried out at various baselines and with phase closure. They are installed on Mt. Wilson, and are obtaining good results.  Scientific objectives include determination of the sizes and changes in size of late-type stars, the formation, distribution and motion of molecules and solids formed around them, and mapping of other important infrared objects. Interferometry at mid-infrared wavelengths allows both the detection and measurement of dust emitted by stars, but also penetration of the dust so that diameters of stars within dust shells can be measured.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p> Recent examples of our work included examination of oscillation in size of miras and of a newly recognized hot shell of material around them, examination of the shapes and motions of dust emitted by stars with detection of gross asymmetries in many such clouds of material, and measurement of diameters of many older stars.</p><p></p>'

S'<p>Our research centers on the design and total synthesis of complex molecules and their application to biological problems, especially in molecular neurobiology and immunology. </p><p> Undoubtedly, neurobiology will gain in importance in the years to come. With a firm grasp on the human genome, the emphasis of the life sciences will shift toward nervous systems and ultimately the human brain. Until recently, however, progress in this field has been hampered by a lack of structural understanding of the basic components that underlie the function of nerve cells: the ionotropic receptors, i.e. ion channels, and the metabotropic receptors, i.e. G-protein coupled receptors. With the emergence of the first X-ray crystal structures of these proteins, this situation has changed dramatically and neurobiology is bound to mature into a truly molecular science. We believe that the time has come for organic chemists, who have a keen understanding of structure and mechanism, to make an impact on the field through rational design and synthesis of molecular probes. </p><p>Immunology is another field that has recently enjoyed more insight at the molecular level. Accordingly, we feel that we can make important contributions here as well. Immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory compounds are at the center of our synthetic program. Due to the involvement of certain ion channels in immunological pathways, our research on ion channels can also be applied to the development of compounds with this activity, placing our group at the forefront of both fields. </p><p>In addition to the interesting biological activity of our target molecules, we see their synthesis as an opportunity to push the limits of organic chemistry. Total synthesis provides an ideal platform for the invention or discovery of new synthetic methodology (often serendipitously) or the application and validation of modern reactions in a complex environment.</p>'

I came to the US as a \xe2\x80\x9cdrained brain\xe2\x80\x9d, hired by Harvard University who did not give me tenure. But I found tenure and happiness at the University of California at Berkeley where I am currently Professor of Anthropology.</p><p> My research for the last 30 years has focused on the transformation of early agricultural (Neolithic) societies of Eastern Europe, where I have directed and published archaeological excavations in the former Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. Since 1997, I have expanded this research interest to include Turkey, directing a team from UC Berkeley in the excavation of the 9000-year old site of \xc3\x87atalh\xc3\xb6y\xc3\xbck. Current research focuses on the life-histories of buildings and the construction of place. Much of my recent practice of archaeology incorporates the utilization of digital, especially multimedia, technology in the presentation of the process of archaeological interpretation, for example in the Chimera Web, about the Neolithic site of Opovo, Yugoslavia and my current project about \xc3\x87atalh\xc3\xb6y\xc3\xbck, <i>Dead Women Do Tell Tales.</i></p><p> In 1998, I was awarded the Presidential Chair in Undergraduate Teaching for a plan to incorporate multimedia authoring into teaching regular courses in archaeology. I am now recognized internationally as one of the leaders of digital education and digital publishing in archaeology. In 2001 with my colleagues Meg Conkey and Rosemary Joyce, I was awarded the Educational Initiatives Award for the innovative development of digital education in the Multimedia Authoring Center for Teaching in Anthropology (MACTiA). This interest in multimedia grows out of a lifelong passion for music. For many years I have been a member of the Grammy-Award winning San Francisco Symphony Chorus. You can find me standing in the middle of the back row. In another life I would have been a stage designer. And one day I hope to keep bees. </p>'

S'<p>My work in the past ten years has focussed on two themes: First, the relation between language use and the development of linguistic forms. The idea here is that language is learned from two sources\xe2\x80&#148;from the ability of children to notice forms and their meanings, including social meanings, and to structure them into grammars, and from the social occasions in which they hear and use forms, that is, what one might call the enabling conditions for language learning. Both are necessary for learning, but the relation between them has been left out of the picture. Second, the developmental changes in the structure of the interpersonal talk of children. We have been studying children\xe2\x80\x99s natural conversations alone with friends for both their organization and for their linguistic features in various languages and cultural settings. This work has included the study of types of talk by children such as narratives, humor, and play organizing, how these are jointly created and interwoven by conversational partners, and how the parts are indicated. Because we have studied best friends, we have also noticed differences in boys\xe2\x80\x99and girls\xe2\x80\x99 talk. Currently, I am returning to an additional theme of my early work, bilingualism, and we have added bilingual children to our studies of the enabling conditions for language learning and of the development of the organization of talk.</p>'

Recent advances in  biotechnology have made it possible to treat proteins and protein-based  systems as pieces with which to construct new structures and machineries  with innovative functions.  <br /><br />We envision combining a synthetic biology-based approach with protein and metabolic engineering techniques. Currently, we are: <br />1. investigating the development of protein microcompartments into tailorable semi-permeable nanoreactors; <br />2. engineering protein secretion machinery to obtain higher yields  for both protein production and consolidated bioprocessing applications;  and <br />3. characterizing and engineering bacterial efflux pumps for the  secretion of biofuels and other relevant, toxic molecules that come into  contact with fuel-synthesizing organisms.</p>'

S'<p>Winner of the 2006-2007 Rome Prize and the 2010-2011 Berlin Prize, Ken Ueno, is a composer, vocalist, improviser, and cross-disciplinary artist. His music coalesces diverse influences into a democratic sonic landscape. In addition to Heavy Metal sub-tone singing and Tuvan throat singing, he is also informed by European avant-garde instrumental techniques, American experimentalism, and sawari or beautiful noise, an aesthetic in traditional Japanese music. Ken\xe2\x80\x99s artistic mission is to champion sounds that have been overlooked or denied so that audiences reevaluate their musical potential. The music pushes the boundaries of perception and challenges traditional paradigms of beauty. In an effort to feature inherent qualities of sound such as beatings, overtones, and artifacts of production noise, Ken\xe2\x80\x99s music is often amplified.</p><p>Ensembles and performers who have played Ken\xe2\x80\x99s music include Kim Kashkashian and Robyn Schulkowsky, Frances-Marie Uitti, Mayumi Miyata, Teodoro Anzellotti, Alarm Will Sound, the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, the Nieuw Ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars, the American Composers Orchestra (Whitaker Reading Session), the Cassatt Quartet, the New York New Music Ensemble, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, the Atlas Ensemble, Rel\xc3\xa2che, the Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra, Dogs of Desire, the Orkest de Ereprijs, and the So Percussion Ensemble.</p><p>Ken\xe2\x80\x99s music has been performed at Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MusikTriennale K\xc3\xb6ln Festival, the Muziekgebouw, the Hopkins Center, Spoleto USA, and Steim. He has been the featured a guest composer at the Takefu International Music Festival, Norfolk Music Festival, the Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival, and the Int\xc3\xa9grales New Music Festival, among others. Ken\xe2\x80\x99s piece for the Hilliard Ensemble, Shiroi Ishi, has been featured in their repertoire for over ten years, with performances at such venues as Queen Elizabeth Hall in England, the Vienna Konzerthaus, and was aired on Italian national radio, RAI 3. Another work, Pharmakon, was performed dozens of times nationally by Eighth Blackbird during their 2001-2003 seasons. A portrait concert of Ken\xe2\x80\x99s was featured on MaerzMusik in Berlin in 2011.</p><p>Awards and grants that Ken has received include those from the American Academy in Rome, the American Academy in Berlin, the Fromm Music Foundation (2), the Aaron Copland House, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music Recording, Meet the Composer (6), the National Endowment for the Arts, the Belgian-American Education Foundation, First Prize in the 25th \xe2\x80\x9cLuigi Russolo\xe2\x80\x9d competition, and Harvard University. Recent projects include works for SFCMP (featuring himself as vocal soloist, with a performance at the Manca Festival in Nice, France), Flexible Music at the Kennedy Center, the Pacific Rim Festival, and a portrait concert in Berlin as part of MaerzMusik. Recently, he performed as soloist in the premieres of his concerto for overtone singer and orchestra in Boston and New York with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project to wide acclaim. A monograph CD of three of his concertos was released on the Bmop/sound label.</p><p>As a vocalist, Ken specializes in extended techniques (overtones, throat-singing, multiphonics, extreme registers, circular singing), and has collaborated in improvisations with Joey Baron, Robyn Schulkowsky, Joan Jeanrenaud, Pascal Contet, Gene Coleman, David Wessel, Robin Hayward, John Kelly, Jorrit Dykstra, Kevork Mourad, Gilberto Bernardes, Hans Tutschku, James Coleman, and Vic Rawlings amongst others. Ken\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing performance projects include collaborations with Tim Feeney, Matt Ingalls, Du Yun, and Lou Bunk.</p><p>In recent years, Ken has been collaborating with visual artists, architects, and video artists to create unique cross-disciplinary art works. With the artist, Angela Bulloch, he has created several audio installations (driven with custom software), which provide audio input that affect the way her mechanical drawing machine sculptures draw. These works have been exhibited at Art Basel as well as at Angela\xe2\x80\x99s solo exhibition at the Wolfsburg Castle. In collaborating with the architect, Patrick Tighe, Ken created a custom software-driven 8-channel sound installation that provided the sonic environment for Tighe\xe2\x80\x99s robotically carved foam construction. Working with the landscape architect, Jose Parral, Ken has collaborated on videos, interactive video installations, and a multi-room intervention at the art space Rialto, in Rome, Italy.&nbsp;</p>'

S'The main goal of my research is to understand the varieties, origins, and consequences of different moral worldviews. I want to know where people get their ideas about what a &amp;quot;good life&amp;quot; looks like and what it means to be a &amp;quot;good person.&amp;quot; Because moral judgment and behavior involve perception, evaluation, and motivation, I have found it essential to integrate insights from cognitive science into my research. Right now I am studying the ways different cultural models of the &amp;quot;good life&amp;quot; influence the trajectories of Millennial Generation as they make the transition from teenagers to &amp;quot;emerging adults.&amp;quot; I have also conducted research on 1970s communes, religion and marijuana use, educational over-qualification, gene-environment interactions, and the relationship between poverty and educational aspirations, among others. Most generally, I want to know why people do the things they do and to understand how culture and cognition work together to shape human behavior.'

S'<p>Professor van Orden specializes in cultural history. She has produced major studies of vernacular culture and the Renaissance chanson, edited a volume of essays on Music and the Cultures of Print (Garland Publishing Inc., 2000), and is currently engaged in researching the interrelationships between material culture, Renaissance humanism, and the chanson in print. Her new book, Music, Discipline, and Arms in Early Modern France (The University of Chicago Press, forthcoming), develops a political argument about music and military culture. Through detailed studies of dance, kingship, and warfare, it shows how music became a disciplinary agent of the absolutist state both on the battlefield and off.</p><p>After receiving a Ph.D. in Music History and Theory at The University of Chicago in 1996, Prof. van Orden held fellowships at the Warburg Institute in London and the Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities. Since coming to Berkeley in 1997, her work has been supported by an AAUW American Post-Doctoral Fellowship, the Hellman Faculty Fund, the Townsend Center for the Humanities, and a President\xe2\x80\x99s Fellowship. National awards include the Paul Pisk Prize and Noah Greenberg Award, both from the American Musicological Society, as well as the Nancy Lyman Roelker Prize from the Sixteenth Century Studies Conference.</p><p>Prof. van Orden has published articles in the Journal of the American Musicological Society, Journal of Musicology, Musical Quarterly, Renaissance Quarterly, and other scholarly journals, as well as conference proceedings and collections of essays. She has been interviewed on the BBC and NPR, lectured at Cambridge, Pennsylvania, and Oxford universities, UCLA, the Newberry Library, and the Clark Library, and given many pre-concert talks. She serves on the Editorial Board of Acta Musicologica and the Advisory Board of the Journal of Musicology.</p><p>Prof. van Orden also specializes in historical performance on the bassoon. She began her career in Europe, performing and recording with ensembles such as Les Arts Florissants (dir. William Christie), Collegium Vocale Ghent (dir. Philippe Herreweghe), and La Petite Bande (dir. Sigiswald Kuijken). Since returning to America, she has appeared regularly with Tafelmusik (dir. Jeanne Lamon), Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra (dir. Nicholas McGegan), and American Bach Soloists (dir. Jeffrey Thomas). She has over forty CDs to her credit and has performed at the London Proms, Utrecht Festival, Salzburg Festival, and in concerts across the North America and Europe. Her recordings are available on Sony, Virgin Classics, Glossa, Teldec, and Harmonia Mundi.</p><p>By extending her historical research to the domain of reconstruction, Prof. van Orden brings a performer\xe2\x80\x99s sensibility to the interpretation of archival materials\xe2\x80&#148;with some extraordinary results. Her research for Music, Discipline, and Arms enabled her to reconstruct the famous equestrian ballet performed for the engagement of Louis XIII in 1612. Under her direction, the work received its modern premier at the Berkeley Festival of Early Music in 2000 to the acclaim of the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal. It was revived in 2002.</p>'

S'<p>Theoretical Physics \xe2\x80&#147; Quantum Condensed Matter. I am interested in systems of many quantum particles, where strong interactions lead to new states of matter. These new states can potentially be realized in experimental systems ranging from strongly correlated materials to dilute atomic gases confined to optical lattices. The intellectual challenge here is twofold. The first is to produce consistent theoretical models of such states, which already places strong constraints on the possibilities. The second is to interpret experimental data from these often complex systems to establish which of these novel states are actually realized in nature.</p><p><b>Current projects</b></p><p><b>Fractionalization:</b> Conventional theories of electronic matter assume that the electron is a well defined excitation, and are able to account for the properties of a number of materials. However, other materials like the high temperature cuprate superconductors where interactions between electrons are particularly important, show many phenomena that are strikingly unconventional. This led to the radical proposal that the electron breaks apart, or fractionalizes, in such systems, which could potentially explain many of these anomalies, although unambiguous experimental evidence for this is still lacking. Much theoretical progress has now been made in understanding electron fractionalization, in particular it is found to go hand in hand with an emergent gauge field. Remarkably, these ideas have also found applications in the area of quantum computing as well as a source of qubits that are naturally resistant to errors arising from decoherence. One of the attractive features of deconfined states is that they can naturally lead to dimensional reduction \xe2\x80&#147; excitations can be confined to planes or chains of a three dimensional systems - which could explain phenomena seen in different materials. I am interested in exploring further these exotic states of matter and their possible realizations in a variety of experimental systems.</p><p><b>Unconventional Quantum Phase Transitions:</b> Recently, it has become clear that quantum phase transitions can also exhibit fractionalization, although the phases on either side of the transition are perfectly conventional. Remarkably, this allows for a (generically) continuous transition between states of very different symmetry, e.g. a superfluid, and a bond centered charge density wave. Such transitions are forbidden according to Landau\xe2\x80\x99s theory of classical phase transitions, and appear here due to the presence of quantum interference effects. I will be pursuing this exciting new development, which may be the key to understanding certain puzzling quantum phase transitions seen in heavy fermion systems.</p><p><b>Phenomenology of Superconductor Quasiparticles:</b> Finally, I am interested in the phenomenology of unconventional superconductors, such as the d-wave superconductivity observed in the cuprate materials. I have worked on developing a theory of heat transport in these systems in the vortex state that is in excellent agreement with experiments, and wish to extend this to studying other transport properties, such as the Nernst effect, just outside the superconducting state. </p>'

S'<p> Our group studies pathogenesis induced by a virus that infects the larvae of lepidopteran insects (moths/butterflies) called Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The study of this virus provides an opportunity to contribute to the development of biological alternatives to chemical pesticides, as well as to gain insight into the molecular and cell biology of the target organisms and virus-cell interactions.AcMNPV is the best-studied member of Baculoviridae, a family of viruses restricted to arthropod hosts. Perhaps because of the strict co-evolution of these viruses with their arthropod (mostly insect) hosts, certain aspects of their replicative strategy are not shared by viruses of vertebrates or plants. One unique property is that early viral genes expressed prior to viral genome replication recruit actin to the nucleus where it is polymerized and exploited for virus progeny production.  Recently we learned that myosin 6, a novel myosin that moves "backwards" (- end directed) is recruited to the nucleus during the late phase of infection, where it co-localizes with F-actin.  Experiments are underway to determine whether nuclear myosin 6 is essential for viral progeny production as well.  </p><p><i><b> Current Projects</b></i></p><p> The focus of current research is at the nexus of cell biology and virology.  The viral genes necessary for actin recruitment to the nucleus have been identified.  The synthesis and localization of each of these proteins is being analyzed currently  in the context of nuclear translocation of GFP actin and timing of progeny virus production in time course experiments.  Recombinants with each of these genes knocked out are being tested for viability and relative ability to produce progeny as well. </p><p> In conjunction with Matt Welche\'s lab (UCB MCB), we are exploring the capability of the minor capsid protein, p78/83, to nucleate the polymerization of nuclear actin.  Sequence information as well as empiracle evidence suggest that p78/83 is a WASP (Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome Protein) family member known to regulate actin nucleation by activating the Arp 2/3 complex.  For this mechanism to be relevant during infection, however, the Arp 2/3 complex would have to be translocated to the nucleus as well.   Preliminary evidence supports this conjecture.  In addition, the possibility that p78/83 is the Arp2/3 nuclear transport agent is being examined. </p><p> In conjunction with Kathy Miller\'s lab (Wash U, St. Louis), we are investigation the mechanism and significance of the translocation of myosin 6 to the nucleus during infection using RNAi techniques, as well as the possible function in myosin 6 in nucleocapsid transport within microvilli of midgut cells during oral infection. </p>'

S'<p>Professor Vollhardt and his coworkers are interested in the application of transition metals to organic synthesis. The areas under investigation range from the assembly of novel oligometallic arrays to the use of cobalt, palladium, and nickel in the construction of complex organic molecules.</p><p>For example, his group has developed ways to attach cyclopentadienylmetal units repeatedly to other p-ligands, such as cyclopentadienyl itself. In this way, a number of potentially catalytic and conducting oligocyclopentadienylmetals with remarkable properties have become available for further exploration.</p><p>A second effort underway is directed at further exploring the scope of the cobalt-mediated [2+2+2]cycloaddition of alkynes to other unsaturated substrates, a reaction pioneered by the Vollhardt group.  Recent work has focused on "tagging" heteroaromatic systems, such as the indole alkaloids, resulting in a total synthesis of strychnine and a novel approach to morphinoids.</p><p>A third problem is concerned with the synthesis of molecules of theoretical importance, in particular highly strained hydrocarbons and molecules with electronically destabilizing features.  These include the phenylenes, a class of novel benzenoids in which benzene and cyclobutadiene are fused in an alternating manner.  Their properties are remarkable, in particular  with respect to cyclohexatrienic reactivity of the benzene nuclei and their potential to behave as organic magnets and conductors.</p>'

These include models grounded in evolutionary theories of senescence. I also work on a variety of problems that pose statistical challenges to demographers,including statistical adjustments to censuses and forecasts of kinship resources for the elderly, including effects of HIV/AIDS on elderly persons in Thailand and elsewhere. As former Chair of the Committee on Population of the National Research Council, I take an interest in forced migration, the demography of complex emergencies, and human rights.

His interests include comparative urban inequality and marginality,  ethnoracial domination, carceral institutions and penal policy as instruments for  managing dispossessed and dishonored groups, violence and the body, intellectuals  and the politics of reason in the neoliberal age, and classical and contemporary  social theory. A past member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University  (1990-1993) and a MacArthur Foundation Fellow (1997-2002), he has been a visiting  professor in Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, and New York City, and invited as a  Fellow to the Russell Sage Foundation, the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, and the  Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences.</p><p>Wacquant is the author of over one hundred scholarly articles published in journals  of sociology, anthropology, criminology, social theory, social policy, philosophy,  and urban and cultural studies, and translated in a dozen languages. Among his books  are An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology (1992, with Pierre Bourdieu, translated in  19 languages), Prisons of Poverty (1999, translated in 14 languages), Body and Soul:  Ethnographic Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer (2000, translated in 6 languages), Los  Parias Urbanos (2001, translated in three languages), The Mystery of Ministry:  Pierre Bourdieu and Democratic Politics (published in five languages in 2005), Das  Janusgesicht des Ghettos und andere Essays (2006), and Deadly Symbiosis: Race and  the Rise of Neoliberal Penality (forthcoming with Polity Press in 2006).</p><p>Wacquant has conducted fieldwork in the colonial island of New Caledonia, on the  South Side of Chicago, and in the jails of big cities in the United States, France,  and Brazil. He has acted as consultant on issues of urban poverty, violence,  ethnicity, and crime to central and local governments, unions, and the courts in  France, Argentina, Brazil, Norway, Sweden, and to the OECD. He is co-founder and  co-editor of the interdisciplinary journal Ethnography, and was a regular  contributor to Le Monde diplomatique from 1996 to 2004.</p><p>Wacquant recently completed a special thematic issue of Ethnography on "Taking  Bourdieu into the Field" (vol. 5, no 4, December 2004); an anthology of the works of  social science\xe2\x80\x99s most famous nephew, Marcel Mauss on Belief, Exchange, and  Social Transformation (forthcoming with the University of Chicago Press); a study of  the mutation of the penal state in advanced society entitled Punishing the Poor: The  New Government of Social Insecurity (to appear in multiple languages in 2006); and  the English translation of his first book on prizefighting, Body and Soul (Oxford  University Press, 2004). He is currently working on the sequel, The Passion of the  Pugilist, an analysis of the dialectic of desire and domination in which he  articulates an argument for "carnal sociology," and a monograph on the construction  of the object in urban ethnography. He is also preparing an anti-reader on the works  of Pierre Bourdieu entitled Practice and Symbolic Power: The Essential Bourdieu. His  next project is a comparative historical sociology of forms and mechanisms of racial  domination over four centuries and three continents provisionally entitled Peculiar  Institutions.</p>'

S'<p>Professor Walker\xe2\x80\x99s best known work is in economic geography, especially The Capitalist Imperative: Territory, Technology and Industrial Growth (Blackwell, 1989), with Michael Storper. Recent writing in this vein includes, "The geography of production" In Sheppard &amp; Barnes, eds. Companion to Economic Geography (2000) and "Putting Capital in its Place: Globalization and the Prospects for Labor" Geo-forum (1999). </p><p>Since 1990, Professor Walker\xe2\x80\x99s focus has been on California, a major economic, political and cultural hearth of world capitalism. This theme is explored in such articles as "California\'s golden road to riches: natural resources and regional capitalism, 1848-1940" Annals of the AAG (2001) and \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia rages against the dying of the light\xe2\x80\x9d New Left Review (1995). </p><p>He has just published a book on history of the state\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing agricultural system, The Conquest of Bread: 150 Years of Agribusiness in California (New Press, 2004). This tells the story of how capitalism developed the California countryside into the leading agrarian production complex in the United States. It has been nominated for a Northern California Book Reviewers\' Award for Non-Fiction in 2004. </p><p>A second book concerns the creation of the San Francisco Bay Area greenbelt and the local environmental movement. The Country in the City: The Greening of the San Francisco Bay Area narrates the many stories of land preservation, saving the bay, and fighting toxics that have made this a global bastion of environmentalism. It is in press and will appear from University of Washington Press in 2006. </p><p>A third project recounts the making of urban landscape of the Bay Area. It will be titled City at Bay: The Making of the San Francisco-Oakland Metropolis. In this work, Walker picks up on themes he explored in early writings on suburbanization and in articles such as \xe2\x80\x9cLandscape and city life: four ecologies of residence in the San Francisco Bay Area.\xe2\x80\x9d Ecumene (1995). </p><p>The fourth project, now in draft, deals with the urbanization of Silicon Valley. Books have been written about electronics in that storied place, but none about the shape of the city that has grown up around the industry. No longer the poster child for sprawl, San Jose and Silicon Valley have become one of the densest and most racially mixed cities in the U.S. This volume is tentatively titled, Silicon City: The Urbanization of the Electronics Mecca. </p><p>An enduring thread of Professor Walker\xe2\x80\x99s thought is the logic of capitalism as an economic, political and social system, and its geographical evolution. It comes out in orthodox forms, as in "Capitalism\'s recurrent self-criticism: an evaluation of Bob Brenner\'s Origins of Global Turbulence" Historical Materialism (2000) and unorthodox ones, as in The New Social Economy: Reworking the Division of Labor (Blackwell, 1992), with Andrew Sayer. </p><p>Walker loves the life of teacher and advisor, and is proud of the many former students teaching around the country. He served five years as Department Chair, 1994-99, helping to re-shape Berkeley Geography. He edited the journal Antipode throughout the 1990s and was Chair of a statewide California Studies Association and of the California Studies Center at UC Berkeley, 2000-2005. </p><p>He has also been an activist in public affairs and on campus, fighting against such monstrosities as the Peripheral Canal, the Gulf War, and the Patriot Act. He takes great joy in the arts of gardening, singing and parenting, among virtues not listed on the official CV. </p>'

S'<p>My research concentrates on innovative cost-effective and cost-beneficial solutions in public and private sector to improve health among the poorest. I am an expert in health information systems analysis, with a focus on cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of health interventions. With more than 35 years of working the public health sector, I have extensive experience studying testing and evaluating health interventions in the US and in more than 20 poor and middle income countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. I was the founding director of the highly successful USAID Data for Decision Making Project while on the faculty at Harvard University and led that multimillion dollar, multi-institutional, multi-country cooperative agreement on health system reform for several years.</p><p>I have broad experience with many international agencies as consultant or expert advisor. As a consultant, I have conducted an analysis of the market feasibility, costs, and cost-effectiveness of the new method of fortification of rice with multivitamins in Columbia and India and a cost effectiveness of improvements in health information systems to enhance information based decision-making in poor countries. In addition to modeling the costs and cost-effectiveness of priority interventions for maternal health, I have  estimated market size for improved diagnostics for pneumonia and chlamydia in Tanzania and for vaginal technologies to decrease STD.  My team evaluated an innovative computer video-assisted method for improving health in rural Uttar Pradesh India that video connects patients and rural health practitioners with physicians in Delhi.  I designed a cost-effectiveness comparison of social franchising and social marketing of antibiotic treatment for childhood pneumonia in Myanmar. For the Seguro Popular, the Mexican insurance scheme for the poor, I have assessed priorities for improving neonatal mortality.</p><p>My \xe2\x80\x98Citation Classic\xe2\x80\x99 publications are used globally for teaching health care in developing countries. I have a keen interest in the widespread market penetration of evidence-based health interventions. At UC Berkeley, I have taught the Global Public Health core course and a course on cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>'

Founded the Phonology Laboratory in 1967, and served as its directoruntil 1975. He is the founding editor of the Journal of Chinese Linguistics, firstpresident of the International Association of Chinese Linguistics, and fellow of theAcademia Sinica. His research on language has ranged widely, resulting in severalbooks, as well as numerous articles.

S'<p>At the centre of my research and teaching interests is a longstanding engagement with Marxian political economy. I was deeply influenced by the dependency theory debates of the 1960\'s and subsequently by the debates within Marxism swirling around figures such as Louis Althusser, Edward Thompson, and Perry Anderson in the 1970s. My own training at University College, London and at the University of Michigan was firmly grounded in Anthropology, Ecology and epistemology, initially with a focus on the limits of ecological anthropology/cultural ecology as a way of understanding the vulnerability of peasants communities in semi arid Africa. Doctoral research was based on long term field research in West Africa and generated a lifelong concern with questions of food security and the agrarian question. While at Berkeley I have tried to deepen my understanding of the intersections between political economy, culture and power, a set of interests I share with a number of my colleagues in the department from whom I have benefited greatly.</p><p>During the 1980s and 1990s I have been able to both expand my interests in Africa with fieldwork in Senegambia on gender and household dynamics and irrigation politics, and to continue my work in Nigeria on Islam, and the political economy and political ecology of oil in the Niger Delta. Concurrent with these interests I have also been able to explore a number of agrarian issues in California and the US, most notably rice in California, and the poultry industry. My two current books projects focus on a history of oil in the Niger Delta, and a history of postwar US capitalism seen through the poultry sector.   I have just finished a book on the Iraq war ("Afflicted Powers". London, Verso, 2005).</p><p>From 1994-2004 I served as the Director of a research Institute, the Institute of International Studies (<a href="http://www.globetrotter.berkeley.edu" title="www.globetrotter.berkeley.edu">www.globetrotter.berkeley.edu</a>), which promotes cross-area and cross-disciplinary research and training on transnational and global issues. I established the Berkeley Working group on Environmental Politics, the major centre for cross disciplinary political ecological research on the Berkeley campus. In addition I play an active role in the Africa Studies Center and co-direct our undergraduate Development Studies Program (a degree granting inter-disciplinary program with almost 100 majors).</p><p>My research has necessarily brought me in contact with various development organizations and philanthropic institutions. I have worked for UNDP, the Ford Foundation, OX-FAM, and a number of small NGOs in Africa (most recently Environmental Rights Action in Nigeria).</p><p>I have been privileged to work with some brilliant students at Berkeley over the last 20 years and encourage in their work a sensitivity to rigorous theoretically oriented field research (what one might call "global ethnography").</p>'

Her research and teaching fields include political sociology, American political development, urban politics and policy, and comparative studies of the welfare state. She has written widely on the politics of social policy and inequality in the United States and Europe. Most recently she has edited The Social Divide: Political Parties and the Future of Activist Government, (Brookings Institution and Russell Sage Foundation Press, 1998), a study of the politics of social policy in the Clinton administration. Other books include Politics and Jobs: The Boundaries of Employment Policy in the United States (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992); The Politics of Social Policy in the United States (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1988) (co-edited with Ann Shola Orloff and Theda Skocpol); Schooling for All: Class, Race and the Decline of the Democratic Ideal (New York: Basic Books, 1985) (with Ira Katznelson). Weir is also the coauthor of a textbook on American government We the People (New York: W.W. Norton:1997) (with Benjamin Ginsberg and Theodore Lowi). She is currently at work on a study of metropolitan inequalities and city-suburban politics in the United States. She is a non-resident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.    The Social Divide: Political Parties and the Future of Activist Government (1998) The extraordinary swings in the scope and content of policy agenda since 1992 have revealed a fundamental partisan divide over the social role of the federal government. This book argues that the recent conflicts over social policy represent key elements in strategies that politicians designed as they attempted to consolidate their party's hold over the federal government. The most striking feature of policymaking across issues was its contentious and intensely partisan character. This highly politicized process, combined with deeply entrenched institutional barriers to change, prevented either party from enacting its major transforming agenda. But neither can the outcome of these years of intense political conflict be characterized as stalemate. Instead, a patchwork of failures and achievements underscores the way politics restricted the range of tools that American policymakers use to respond to new social and economic conditions. The poor have been the biggest losers as Democrats and Republicans fought to win the middle class over to their vision of the future.The book highlights three distinctive features of politics and policymaking in creating this politics: the polarization of political elites; the predominance of advertising politics and intense fragmented interest group politics as political parties have ceased to mobilize ordinary people into politics; and the unprecedented role that budgetary concerns have played in social policymaking.The authors first analyze the institutions and tools of policymaking, including Congress, the political use of public opinion polling, and the politics of the deficit. They then consider policies designed to win over the middle class, including health care policy, employer-provided social benefits, wages and jobs, and crime policy. Last, they address policies targeted at the disadvantaged, including welfare, affirmative action, and urban policy. </p>"

S'<p>Our laboratory studies macromolecular transport in eukaryotic cells. The high degree of compartmentalization in eukaryotes causes a spatial separation of cellular processes such as DNA transcription and mRNA translation. This leads to the bi-directional exchange of a large number of macromolecules between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and allows additional levels of control in eukaryotic gene expression. The site of exchange is the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a multiprotein structure, consisting of probably almost 1000 polypeptides. Every minute several thousand macromolecules are transported through a single NPC in both directions. Export cargoes include different classes of RNA such as messenger RNA (mRNA) , ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). In the opposite direction, a large number of proteins and matured snRNP particles are actively imported into the nucleoplasm. In addition, a number of proteins have been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Many of these transport events are mediated by a large family of proteins, which all share homology with the protein import receptor importin b. Interestingly, all members of this protein family are regulated by the small GTPase Ran which is highly enriched in the nucleus in its GTP-bound form. In addition to their function in nuclear transport in interphase, Ran and its downstream effectors also play an important role in mitosis. The common explanation for the multiple functions of the Ran system is that Ran acts as a spatial marker that signals the position of the eukaryotic genome in interphase and mitosis. Our lab combines genetic and biochemical approaches in S. cerevisiae and metazoan cells to analyze the molecular machinery that is responsible for the transport of macromolecules in interphase and to characterize the function of the small GTPase Ran throughout the cell cycle.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The small GTPase Ran is a highly conserved and abundant protein, which is predominantly located in the nucleus in interphase cells. Similar to other members of the family of small GTPases, Ran cycles constantly between two functional states and exists in a GTP-bound and a GDP-bound form. The Ran cycle is regulated by the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 in one direction and by the GTPase activating protein RanGAP together with Ran-binding proteins in the other. Remarkably, these regulatory proteins are highly compartmentalized. While RCC1 is found exclusively in the nucleus where it is bound to chromatin, RanGAP is confined to the cytoplasm. The compartmentalized distribution of these Ran regulators leads in turn to an asymmetric distribution of the two Ran states with RanGTP being highly enriched around chromatin or in the nucleus. The steep RanGTP gradient between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is essential for many nucleocytoplasmic transport processes: RanGTP confers directionality to nuclear transport events and acts as a positional marker which defines the nuclear interior for nuclear export and import. In addition to its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport in interphase cells, a second, mitotic function for Ran was recently identified since it was shown that Ran plays an important role in mitotic spindle assembly. The mitotic effects of Ran are mainly mediated by the transport factor importin b. Importin b acts as an inhibitor of spindle assembly by sequestering a microtubule aster promoting activity collectively termed APA. APA components are locally discharged from importin b by RanGTP, which is specifically generated in the vicinity of chromosomes by its chromatin-bound nucleotide exchange factor RCC1. We are identifying and analyzing the individual components of APA and seek to understand how they affect microtubule stability and how they direct microtubule growth towards mitotic chromatin. With the help of in vitro import systems we also study how the RanGTP gradient is mechanistically coupled to the translocation of proteins and multiprotein complexes through the roughly 200 nm-long aqueous channel of the NPC. We aim to dissect and understand the molecular mechanism of nuclear transport with the goal to understand how this important cellular transport pathway is regulated in vivo.</p>'

S'<p>Glossiphoniid leech embryos are well suited for cellular and molecular analyses of embryonic development. They are also one of the best studied representatives of the phylum Annelida (segmented worms). Molecular phylogenies indicate that most bilaterally symmetric animals fall into three major groups whose ancestors had already diverged by the time of the Cambrian explosion, ~600 million yeas ago: Edysozoa (arthropods, nematodes and other "cuticle-shedding" animals); Lophotrochozoa (annelids, mollusks flatworms, and a number of related minor phyla); and Deuterostomia (echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates). Assuming that the last common ancestor of these three groups was a relatively simple flatworm like creature, it is of interest to determine how processes such as gastrulation and segmentation have evolved in isolation in the three major groups of animals.</p><p>Accordingly, the goals of the research in this lab are twofold: first, to obtain as satisfying as possible an understanding of leech development; and second, to understand how developmental processes are modified during the evolution of different animal taxa. For example, leeches undergo spiral cleavages homologous to those of mollusks, yet generate a segmented body plan, like arthropods. How have cell fates been modified among the different spirally cleaving animal groups to generate different types of embryos and adults? In particular, how is it that leeches make exactly 32 segments during development and cannot make more, either post-embryonically or in response to injury, while closely related annelids (oligochaetes) exhibit wonderful capacities for post-embryonic segmentation, regeneration, and even vegetative reproduction? And how finally, how is it that in annelids, chordates (and many arthropods) segment primordia arise sequentially from a posterior zone of cell migr ation and/or proliferation, whereas flies generate segments simultaneously within a syncytial blastoderm? Our work entails the use of various cellular, molecular and embryological techniques. Microinjection of cell lineage tracers and various imaging techniques are frequently used in combination with other procedures.</p><p>Areas of recent interest include:</p><p>(1) the assignment of distinct ectodermal and mesodermal fates to the animal and vegetal daughters of macromere D\' at fourth cleavage;(2) the inductive regulation of cell-cell fusion in endoderm;(3) the molecular control of stem cell divisions in the posterior growth zone;(4) dynamic patterns of wnt and notch expression in the 2-cell embryo;(5) the mechanisms of epiboly (cell movements during gastrulation);(6) gangliogenesis and the assignments of specific neuronal fates.(7) developmental comparisons of leeches and oligochaetes.</p><p>Given its compact genome and the extensive knowledge of its developement that is already available, Helobdella robusta (the leech we study), was an appropriate choice for one of the first lophotrochozoan species for genome sequencing at the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek.</p>'

S'<p>One of the most intriguing puzzles of modern astronomy is how stars are born; much of the interesting action takes place deep within dark dust clouds, and a classical optical telescope sees the final product only after the dust is blown away. The nursery door is closed to visible and ultraviolet radiation. However, infrared and radio waves do get out of a dust cloud, and a high-resolution radio picture can show what is going on, both by angular imaging and by measuring the velocity field through application of the Doppler effect to the observed spectral transitions. In collaboration with other researchers and students in the Radio Astronomy Laboratory and Astronomers at the Universities of Maryland and Illinois, we have developed a Michelson Interferometer Array for millimeter wavelengths at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory of the University of California, located near Mt. Lassen in the northern part of the state. This instrument can form high-resolution images with good spectral coverage of regions of star formation. What we "see" is radiation emitted by trace chemicals in each dust cloud: HCN, CO, etc. The pictures show remarkable objects and processes such as energetic winds and outflows ejected from protostars and massive, rapidly rotating gas clouds with disk shape that are probably the early stages of star clusters.  This instrument has operated as the Berkeley Maryland Illinois Association Millimeter Array since 1988.  At the present time,this instrument is being combined with a similar array at Caltech which will be locatedat Cedar Flats in the Into Mountains of southern California.  The new combined instrument will be known a CARMA.A new activity at the Hat Creek Observatory in which I am involved is the development of a novel large centimeter wavelength radio telescope, the Allen Telescope Array. This instrument, a joint project with the SETI Institute in Mountainview, will carry out sensitive studies of the ISM and the distant universe, as well as searches for technological evidence of complex life on other planets.</p>'

S"<p>Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive cell motility and shape change. In particular we are studying the engine that powers these processes, the actin cytoskeleton, using a combination of cell biological, biochemical, and genetic techniques. We are working to determine how actin filament assembly is initiated, how it is regulated by signal transduction pathways, and how it contributes to the forces that drive cell shape change and movement. In addition we are working to understand how the normal functions of the actin cytoskeleton are subverted by bacterial and viral pathogens during infection.</p><p><b> Current Projects</b></p><p>Cellular regulation of actin assembly. Coordinating cell shape change and motility in response to extracellular and intracellular cues requires precise spatial and temporal regulation of actin filament assembly. One key control point in actin assembly is the initiation of new filament formation - a processes called nucleation. Work from our lab and others has established that the Arp2/3 complex, an evolutionarily conserved protein complex, is a critical actin nucleating factor in cells that functions in the vicinity of the plasma membrane to generate new actin filaments and organize them into Y-branched networks. The Arp2/3 complex is a fascinating macromolecular machine that consists of seven subunits including the actin-related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 and five other proteins (ARPC1-5). To determine how these seven polypeptides work in concert to nucleate and organize actin filaments, we have reconstituted recombinant human Arp2/3 complex using the baculovirus expression system. We are using this powerful tool to study the biochemical mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex assembly and function.</p><p> The activity of the Arp2/3 complex is regulated in cells by proteins called nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) which bind to the complex and stimulate its nucleating and organizing activities. Cells contain multiple families of NPFs, and we are interested in understanding how different NPFs may regulate the formation of diverse actin-containing structures. One NPF of particular interest is the Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), encoded by the gene mutated in the inherited immune deficiency disorder Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome. WASP and its related proteins bind to lipids and signal transduction proteins, and we are working to understand how these factors regulate WASP activity at the plasma membrane to modulate cell motility and membrane remodeling. We recently developed a powerful model system for studying the cellular function of WASP family proteins. In this system, WASP-coated beads are introduced into cell cytoplasmic extracts, and actin polymerization at the bead surface generates a force that powers bead motility. We are using this and similar systems to dissect the function and regulation of WASP family proteins during cell shape change and motility. </p><p>Interaction between pathogens and the host actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton of human cells is targeted during infection by an amazing variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. Studying the interaction between pathogens and the host cell's actin cytoskeleton has provided important insights into the mechanisms that control actin assembly and function. One pathogen of particular interest is Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that is internalized by host cells, induces the polymerization of the actin at its surface, and uses the energy derived from polymerization to power intracellular motility and cell to cell spread. Actin polymerization at the L. monocytogenes surface is initiated by the Arp2/3 complex and a bacterial NPF called ActA, and we are investigating the mechanism by which these factors function to nucleate actin assembly. In addition we are working to understand how other bacterial and viral pathogens manipulate the host cytoskeleton during infection.</p>"

S'<p>Research in Professor Wemmer\'s laboratory is aimed at understanding the interactions which govern the function of various biopolymers (proteins, DNA, RNA). These interactions include those which stabilize particular conformations of the molecule, as well as those through which different molecules interact to form specific complexes, and carry out their functions. The major tool used is nuclear magnetic resonance, particularly multidimensional methods, often with biosynthetic isotope enrichment. For many moderate size biopolymers the resonances can be systematically assigned to particular sites in the molecule. Nuclear Overhauser effect measurements can be used to determine interproton distances, from which structures can be calculated. In addition, structural fluctuations can be detected using measurements of spin relaxation, or exchange of amide or imino protons. These general approaches are being applied to many different problems, a few of which are described below. </p><p>Solution structures have been determined for a variety of complexes of DNA oligomers with small molecule ligands. The natural product distamycin binds in the minor groove in A\xc2\xb7T rich sequences. It has been found that there are two forms of complex, one with a single ligand in a narrow groove, and one with two ligands side-by-side in a wider groove. Examining the sequence dependence of binding allows the modification of a design for G\xc2\xb7C recognizing ligands to specifically recognize mixed A\xc2\xb7T/G\xc2\xb7C sequences for the first time. The ideas are now being extended to linked dimers, and to mixed designs which recognize longer sequences. Such small molecule ligands which recognize DNA sequence specifically may be useful in molecular biology, and perhaps later as pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Over the past few years most of the group\'s studies of proteins have focused on those involved in regulation of genetic expression. Several of these proteins are transcription factors, which are modular structures which recognize DNA and assemble other proteins into the transcription complex. While the domains which recognize DNA are well structured, those involved in forming protein-protein complexes seem to be primarily disordered. Work is now focusing on complexes to try to understand how such domains function. Other regulatory proteins under study include a bacterial repressor, and a sequence specific RNA binding protein which regulates splicing. For a majority of these studies we take advantage of isotope enrichment with 15N and 13C with 3D and 4D NMR experiments. </p><p>Other ongoing studies in the lab examine unusual DNA structures, a variety of cofactors, peptides, and unnatural "bio"polymers. We continue to try to exploit recent advances in 3H labeling and NMR to address biomolecular problems. </p>'

S'<p>There exist about a dozen different "movies" of the visual world, formed in parallel within the retina. Each movie extracts a different feature from the visual scene, and each abstraction is carried centrally by a separate population of optic nerve fibers. These movies constitute a basic visual language, formed initially in the retina through a complex series of neural interactions, then processed further at higher visual centers. Each movie shows surprisingly rich forms of dynamic excitatory and inhibitory activity that can be traced to the dynamic "footprints" of the specific component cellular networks that interact to generate each movie. We are working toward understanding how these movies are formed, what "features" they abstract from the visual world, and how they maintain their function in the presence of noise and in natural visual environments.</p><p>Recently we\'ve been focusing on a ubiquitous network interaction called "crossover inhibition" where differential circuitry in the retina compensates for the nonlinearities of synaptic transmission. Through these interactions, both linear and nonlinear processing are implemented to generate visual functions such as motion detection, texture detection, looming detection, directional selectivity.</p><p>Current Projects</p><p>Optical Recording of Retinal Activity. It is no easy matter to acquire the activity from large populations of neurons. One promising method is the use of optical recording techniques where large populations of cells are filled with a calcium sensitive dye that changes its fluorescent properties when neurons are active. These patterns can be read out with appropriate video cameras. The idea is to directly see each of the many "neural images" created in the retina through complex neuronal interactions.</p><p>Networks of Interacting interneurons. The patterns at the retinal output represent the cumulative effects of many simpler retinal networks at earlier stages of visual processing. We can study these networks directly using patch recording from a variety of cell types, still connected to their networks, in thin retinal slices, a technique pioneered in this laboratory. From these studies we are learning that many of the "movies" talk to one another to refine the set of abstractions.</p><p>Modeling retinal interactions. The dynamic interactions between thousands of individual cells, belonging to several different populations are difficult to think about without some infrastructure upon which to place all the findings. We use the paradigm of the Cellular Neural Network, a supercomputer on a chip with architecture very similar to that of the retina: a massively parallel analog array processor. We can make the chip behave like each of the different elementary retinal networks, then allow these hypothetical networks to interact to generate each of the movies at the retinal output. Comparing the overall network response to measured activity serves as a test for our "hypothesis" about retinal connectivity. The feature detectors generated by implementation of our hypotheses form algorithms based upon retinal behavior that can be "exported" for use in practical systems such as the "camera" for a prosthetic vision device, or a detector of a variety of specific visual targets.</p>'

S'<p>I am an ecologist and ecotoxicologist with interests in the impact of human activities, particularly the release of toxic substances, on organisms at the individual, population, and community levels. I am most interested in applying basic ecological insights (e.g., feeding strategy, natural history) to toxicology in order to provide greater environmental realism to questions of pollutant exposure and bioaccumulation. Most of my research falls within the general area of pollutant bioavailability and bioaccumulation and the extension of these principles to assessment of ecological risk posed by contaminated aquatic sediments. Most of the current research in my laboratory is focused in either of two areas. First, we are developing a procedure to better quantify the bioavailable contaminant in sediment by extraction of the sediment using the digestive fluid of deposit-feeding invertebrates. Solubilization by this fluid, rather than an exotic chemical as would be used in a conventional extraction, has greater ecological relevance and provides a better basis for environmental management decisions. With funding from EPA, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey and others, we are refining this technique for management of contaminated sediments. Secondly, we are examining the effects of agricultural pesticide use in the San Francisco Bay watershed on aquatic organisms, and particularly those species which are important prey for chinook salmon. Of particular interest is the bioavailability of particle-associated pesticides and the interactions of exposure duration, frequency and magnitude in determining toxic effect. Other recently completed projects in my laboratory include the rate and manner in which DDT residues move out of a contaminated food web after dredging and removal of DDT-contaminated sediments; and the environmental effects of antibiotics from aquaculture operations on natural microbial communities.</p>'

S'<p>Theoretical research in Professor Whaley\'s group is focused on elucidating and manipulating chemical dynamics in strongly quantum environments. Our current interests lie in i) quantum behavior of nanoscale clusters, and ii) molecular aspects of Quantum Computation. </p><p>Clusters present a major challenge to chemistry and physics. These systems are intermediate in size between molecular and bulk, and often display marked finite size scaling of their physical and chemical properties. Too large for conventional \'molecular\' techniques, they are also too small for traditional bulk theoretical methods, and therefore require new approaches to be developed for analysis of their energetic, structural and dynamical properties. We study a wide range of clusters in the nanoscale regime, ranging from weakly bound van der Waals aggregates of helium and hydrogen ("quantum clusters") to strongly covalently bound semiconductor clusters. Quantum clusters of helium with 20 - 105 atoms are liquid-like but can display a high degree of local ordering upon addition of molecular species. These clusters provide a novel, gentle environment for ultra-cold, high resolution, molecular spectroscopy which is just beginning to be explored experimentally. Elucidation of the relation between the new chemistry displayed by these clusters and the unusual physical properties of bulk superfluid helium is an important goal. Theoretical methods and algorithms for large scale molecular level calculations are being developed for characterization of factors affecting structure, dynamics, and impurity spectroscopy in these nanoscale quantum matrices. Very different problems are posed by covalently bonded semiconductor clusters of materials such as CdSe or Si, which show bulk lattice structure over the entire size range 10 - 100 \xc3\x85 (50 - 104 atoms) but display strongly size dependent electronic properties. The size scaling of optoelectronic properties are components in the development of a fundamental understanding which may be used to design novel nanocrystalline clusters with interesting device applications. </p><p>Quantum information processing employs superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement to encode and manipulate information in very different ways from the classical information processing underlying current electronic technology.  Dramatic advances in quantum computational algorithms based on the parallelism resulting from quantum mechanical state evolutions, have led to experimental efforts to implement small scale quantum logic devices.  Our theoretical work on decoherence, optimal universal quantum computation, and scalable quantum arrays, seeks to define and facilitate the physical implementation of scalable quantum computations</p>'

S'<p>I am a theorist and phenomenologist. While I originally trained in Particle Physics, in the last few years my interest has centered around the question of the formation of structure in the universe. How did it originate, what were the forces responsible for making it what it is today and what can it teach us about the universe? I am particularly interested in using cosmology to learn about the nature of the dark energy believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate, in the formation and evolution of galaxies and of active galactic nuclei.</p><p>Cosmology today is in a state similar to where particle physics was 20 years ago. The big picture is in place, but many of the fundamental questions remain unanswered. With the tremendous growth in computational and observational power, cosmology is a rapidly moving and fairly young field and can also be quite competitive.</p><p>I am a member of the Theoretical Cosmology group. My work involves both analytical and numerical components, with some simulations (and data-analysis). The basic framework is (general) relativistic perturbation theory and quantum field theory, plus some simple radiative transfer and fluid mechanics.</p><p>While the study of structure formation is a unifying concept, my research falls into several different categories:</p><ul><li>Numerical simulations of structure formation</li><li>Cosmic Microwave Background</li><li>Large-Scale Structure</li><li>Galaxy formation and evolution</li></ul><p>In addition to my purely theoretical work I am a member of several large experimental teams. On such experiments theorists often play a role in identifying which measurements are most amenable to comparison with theory, producing calculations or simulations which can be used to analyze the data, and using these to tease out the answers to specific questions.</p><ul><li>I am the chair of the survey science team for BOSS, a part of SDSS-III aimed at constraining dark energy and our theories of gravity.</li><li>I am a Planck Scientist and member of the LFI and HFI core teams and have a long-standing involvement in the US component of Planck, a European-led satellite mission to study anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which is currently in orbit.</li><li>I am an active member of the Dark Energy Survey, a next-generation imaging survey aiming to cover 5,000 sq.deg. over 5 years.  In addition I am involved in a lesser way with a host of smaller experiments or collaborations of more modest size.</li></ul>'

S'<p>I am an anthropological archaeologist who conducts research at the intersection of archaeology and documentary history. I use documentary, oral historical and material culture to explore the construction of ethnic, gender, class and race identities at the household level in post-contact New World settings. The majority of my research focuses upon the late 18th to early 20th centuries. During the periods I study, families were increasingly incorporated into global exchange networks, leading them to be consumers, rather than producers of the materials they used in cultural negotiations of identity. Therefore, one of the major lines of my research explores how individuals and families appropriate and personalize mass-produced goods to express ethnic, gender, race and class values.</p><p> I am currently involved in two major research projects. The first is a study of African consumerism and creolization during the period of enslavement in the Bahamas. Unlike many Caribbean contexts, the Bahamas was home to a large free and enslaved African-born population as late as the 19th century, when English trade networks to the area were well established. The Bahamas islands, while having good access to European markets, were poor in natural resources (such as clay or iron ore) that were utilized by enslaved Africans in the rest of the Caribbean to recreate African art traditions. As such, the goods of the consumer market was the main arena for the expression of African aesthetics through material culture. I am undertaking the excavation of enslaved households at five different Bahamian plantations to explore how consumer goods were used to construct African-Bahamian identities.</p><p> My second research project explores the development of a multi-ethnic community in Northern California, from the 1840s through the 1920s. Annadel was first settled by European and European-American homesteaders during the 1840s-1860s. By the 1870s, the area was found to be rich in basalt, and mining industries developed, which attracted additional immigrant labor and families. This project is in its preliminary stages, but its goal is to explore how families in a changing commercial and cultural environment negotiate a sense of community identity.</p>'

S"<p>Professor Williams's research group develops methods, instrumentation, and theory in mass spectrometry, separations, and spectroscopy, with the general goals of understanding the structure, reactivity, and function of biomolecules, including those present in complex mixtures such as cells.  Current research problems of interest include: </p><p><b>Protein Conformation and Folding</b> Understanding how proteins fold and the relationship between protein sequence and conformation presents a key challenge in chemistry. The group is investigating the conformation of peptide and protein ions in the gas-phase; both highly compact and fully denatured conformations have been observed. The conformation of these ions with a controlled number of bound water molecules is being investigated to provide a detailed understanding of the role of solvent in protein conformation and folding. A highly sensitive method using capillary electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry is being developed to obtain information about the sequence and solution-phase conformation of proteins and nucleic acids.  </p><p><b>Protein and DNA Sequencing </b>The Williams\xc3\xad group is developing dissociation methods, including photodissociation and blackbody infrared radiative dissociation, for rapid identification and sequencing of large protein and DNA molecules. </p><p><b>Dynamics of Proton Transfer and Dissociation Reactions </b>Electrostatic interactions in multiply protonated biomolecules play a key role in their structure and function. These interactions also result in unusual ion-molecule charge-transfer and dissociation chemistry that is being explored by experimental methods and by molecular dynamics simulations. </p><p><b>Zwitterion and Salt-bridge Structures </b>Amino acides are zwitterions in aqueous solution within a wide range of pH, whereas their neutral forms are more stable in the gas phase.  In the presence of a charge, amino acids can exist as zwitterions in the form of a salt bridge.  Salt bridges are often formed in the interior of proteins and strongly influence conformation.  Both experiment and theory are used to investigate the structure of amino acids and small peptides as a function of cation size and change, as well as solvation extent to determine the role of electric field and solvent on zwitterion stability. </p><p><b>Non-covalent Complexes </b>Specific non-covalent interactions of biomolecules can be retained in the gas-phase. The binding energy of small complexes can be determined from thermal dissociation measurements. This method is being extended to larger systems, such as enzyme substrate complexes. The combined specificity and sensitivity of this method could greatly facilitate the rapid screening of new drugs. </p>"

S"<p>Signal transduction, Apoptosis, Infectious diseases, Immune Tolerance,Genomics.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p><i>Apoptosis</i> is essential in elimination of lymphocytes that recognize self-proteins but also plays a crucial role in many aspects of biology. We are interested in the apoptotic signal transduction events. All apoptotic processes are believed to converge at the downstream caspases, which execute the final demise of a cell. In T cells, signals from the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex can lead to different outcomes: apoptosis, proliferation or differentiation. We'd like to understand the underlying mechanisms of the decision between life and death. </p><p><i>Fas and a subset of its tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members (TNF-RI, DR3, TRAIL receptors) </i>contain a death domain at their cytoplasmic tails, which initiate apoptosis through an adapter protein called FADD. FADD recruits caspase 8, which activation leads to a cascade of caspases and rapid cell death. FADD-/- cells are resistant to FasL-, TNF- and TRAIL-killing, suggesting that FADD is a universal adapter for many receptor-mediated death. In addition to its function in apoptosis, FADD surprisingly has a role in proliferation. FADD-/- T cells are defective in TCR-stimulated proliferation and exhibit abnormal regulation of cell cycle proteins like CDK4 or cyclinD3. FADD is phosphorylated at the G2/M stage of the cell cycle and its regulation is crucial for the function of FADD in cell cycle progression. Current projects include biochemical characterization of FADD-associated protein during proliferation and how FADD balances proliferation and apoptosis. </p><p><i>TRAIL (TNF- related apoptosis inducing ligand)</i> is a cytokine that can kill a variety of tumor cells but leave normal cells largely intact. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this differential sensitivity of apoptosis between normal and cancerous cells. These include the presence of decoy receptors in normal cells, loss of an anti-apoptotic molecule in tumor cells and selective mutation of p53 and p19 in cancerous cells that somehow confer sensitivity to the TRAIL apoptotic inducing activity. Experiments are in progress to distinguish these possibilities and to understand the role of TRAIL in normal physiology by challenging mutant mice with a variety of pathogens. </p><p><i>The orphan steroid nuclear receptor Nur77</i> and its family member Nor-1 are two of the genes that are rapidly induced during TCR induced apoptosis. A dominant negative Nur77 mutant can inhibit TCR-mediated apoptosis. Constitutive expression of Nur77 or Nor1 leads to massive apoptosis in immature Tcells. Recent data indicate that Nur77 might translocate to mitochondria to initiate apoptosis. Current projects include generation of Nor-1 deficient mice, identification of the downstream target genes by DNA microarray analysis and understanding Nur77 in mitochondria apoptosis biology. </p><p><i>To understand how Nur77 is regulated by TCR signaling,</i> we are working on the signal transduction pathway between TCR and Nur77. We showed that Nur77 transcription is mediated through two MEF2 elements. However, MEF2 protein level or phosphorylation does not change when T cells are stimulated. Instead, we found a MAP kinase ERK5, which contains two domains important for the regulation of MEF2 activity: a MEF2-interacting domain and a transcriptional activation domain. Interaction between ERK5 and MEF2 depends on activation in T cells, and expression of ERK5 lacking its activation domain inhibits MEF2-dependent transcription. Up-regulation of Nur77 through kinase-dependent co-activation of MEF2 by ERK5 constitutes a novel mechanism of MAP kinase function. Current projects are aimed at understanding ERK5 regulation in vitro and in vivo.</p>"

S'<p>Paul K. Wright assumed the position of Chief Scientist for CITRIS at UC Berkeley in  January 2006. CITRIS is the Center for Information Technology in the Interests of  Society. It serves 4 UC campuses and hosts many multi-disciplinary projects on large  societal problems such as healthcare, services and intelligent infrastructures such  as energy, water and sustainability. He is a professor in the mechanical engineering  department, where he holds the A. Martin Berlin Chair. Wright also serves as  co-director of the Berkeley Manufacturing Institute (BMI) and co-director of the  Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC). From 1995 to 2005 he served as co-chair of  the Management of Technology Program (a joint program with the Haas School of  Business). His current research is in Energy Scavenging and Storage for  Micro-electronics. Previous research was on Internet-based rapid-prototyping and  manufacturing (CyberCut). Born in London, he obtained his degrees from the  University of Birmingham, England and came to the United States in 1979 following  appointments at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and Cambridge University  England.</p><p>Current research focuses on permanently-powered micro-energy supplies for the next  generation of \xe2\x80\x9cmicro-scale motes\xe2\x80\x9d in Wireless Sensor Nets. We have already  discovered, demonstrated and published how to do this at the meso-scale. We also  have the beginnings of micro-scale energy scavengers. Rapid prototyping by pneumatic  dispensing of millimeter-scale lithium polymer ion rechargeable batteries is being  developed in joint work with Professor Evans in MSE. The next steps are to refine  the models and analyses for both the micro-scale scavengers and micro-scale storage  systems. Also, over the next 3-5 years the goals are to integrate these  micro-power-sources with the sensing, actuating, and communications. This is needed  from both a cost and miniaturization perspective, not only for future deployments in  our Demand Response project \xe2\x80&#147; future applications in healthcare especially demand  this level of miniaturization of devices.</p>'

S"<p>My research interests are in advanced accelerator concepts, intense laser-plasma interaction and the basic equilibrium, stability, and radiation properties of intense charged particle beams. The research includes basic theory, simulation and the development of proof-of-principle experiments. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>My current research is on wake excitation and pulse propagation in plasma channels, muon colliders, the development of simplified models of intense laser-plasma interactions, two-dimensional turbulence in nonneutral plasmas, and free-electron laser oscillators. </p><p>High energy accelerators have served as the main tool with which physicists have explored the building blocks of matter for more than sixty years. During this time there has been an exponential increase in the energy of accelerated particles. This increase has been made possible by a combination of improvements in existing machines and the invention of new acceleration techniques. Historically, whenever a given type of accelerator has reached the limit of its performance, an innovative idea for particle manipulation, storage, cooling or acceleration has made possible experiments at ever higher energies. The US High Energy Physics community faces serious challenges over the next decades. While a new high-energy Hadron Collider, the LHC, is being built at CERN, there is a significant risk, especially if 1 TeV center-of-mass energy electron-positron collider is constructed in Japan, that no new high-energy facility will be constructed in the United States beyond the TeVatron and the B-factory. This situation lends some urgency to innovation and the serious examination of new ideas. </p><p>I work on advanced accelerator concepts, in particular laser-plasma accelerators and muon colliders. These nascent concepts may turn into the workhorses of high-energy physics in the 21st century. Plasma accelerators may have applications, at lower energies, to other fields, such synchrotron radiation sources, as well. A major challenge facing researchers on laser-driven plasma accelerators is to overcome laser diffraction, the most severe limit on the energy to which particles can be accelerated. A second challenge is to accelerate a well-collimated electron bunch with a small energy spread. Theoretical investigations have shown that a hollow plasma channel can potentially achieve both challenges. In collaboration with the LBL Center for Beam Physics we are theoretically and experimentally investigating plasma channel accelerators. </p><p>The concept of Muon-Muon Colliders originates in the 70's. More recently, a collaboration led by BNL, FNAL and LBNL has undertaken detailed studies of the muon collider. As part of this collaboration, we have responsibility for coordinating the collider ring research and are studying collective phenomena in the collider ring of a muon collider. This ring has many unique features. The luminosity requires that the muon bunches have a high current and small energy spread, and the muons only live for around one thousand turns. Such a ring will need to operate above instability thresholds and must rely on a variety of innovative techniques for beam control. In a work that has applications to storage rings in general, we have found that the periodic temporal variation of ring parameters, such as magnet field strengths, can be used suppress collective instabilities. </p><p>The propagation of intense short-pulse lasers in underdense plasmas in strongly influenced by parametric instabilities, such as Raman scattering. Nonlinear Raman scattering is usually studied with particle-in-cell simulations. We are developing a simplified nonlinear model of Raman backscattering that preserved the important physics but has a much faster numerical implementation. Backscatter may be an important diagnostic in future inertial confinement experiments. </p><p>A final area of research is on the theoretical understanding of nonneutral plasmas under conditions where the plasma dynamics closely resemble that of a two-dimensional Eulerian fluid. </p>"

S'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are of both fundamental and technological interest. They not only exhibit interesting electronic and optical properties intrinsically associated with their low dimensionality and the quantum confinement effect, but also represent the critical components in the potential nanoscale device applications. With the ever-decreasing sizes of these 1D nanostructures, the &amp;quot;bottom-up&amp;quot; chemical approach is playing increasing role due to its capability of making much smaller features as compared to the &amp;quot;top-down&amp;quot; approach. Major challenge, however, remains in order to fully exploit the 1D nanostructures, namely, the development of suitable chemical strategies for the rational synthesis, organization and integration of these nanoscale building blocks. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Yang research group is interested in the synthesis of new classes of materials and nanostructures with an emphasis on developing new synthetic approaches and understanding the fundamental issues of structural assembly and growth that will enable the rational control of material composition, micro/nano- structure, property and functionality. We are putting together a nanoscale toolbox where nanowires of different compositions and properties (metal, semiconductor) will be used as building blocks in our continuing efforts in miniaturizing optoelectronic devices. For example, semiconductor (Si, Ge, ZnO, GaN) nanowires are being synthesized using chemical vapor deposition/transport. Significant effort has also been placed on investigating the novel physical properties of the nanowire building blocks. Particularly we are interested in the thermoelectrical, photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties. Due to their high surface area, low-dimensionality and potential quantum confinement, many new physical properties are expected. These novel properties serve as the basis for miniaturized devices such as laser, photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and solar-to-fuel conversion systems.&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt;'

S'<p>Before studying anthropology I specialized in telecommunications and linguistics (MS from St. Petersburg Academy of Aviation and Space Technology, Russia) and worked in research on speech synthesis and recognition (Department of Linguistics at St. Petersburg University and Popov Institute of Communications and Acoustics). My two areas of primary interest are <b>linguistic anthropology and post-Soviet Russia and Eastern Europe.</b> In the first area I am particularly interested in the analysis of how ideologies (political, cultural, national, market, etc.) are projected on and work through language, and what methods of discourse analysis social scientists can use to unpack their discursive power. In the second area of interest I am concerned with the contemporary transformations in the "post-communist" world, in particular in Russia. Specifically, I am interested in the cultural shifts brought forth by the collapse of the Soviet ideology, state institutions, and centralized economic principles and the advent of the ideology, institutions, and economic principles of a type of market, and how the interplay between these different forces contributed to the formation of socialist and post-socialist identities and subject positions. I am also interested in how forces of globalization (in business, mass media, communication technologies, transportation) become involved in the social processes of domination and resistance, division and unification, continuity and change, and the local responses to them. More generally my theoretical interests include the analysis of human agency and its interplay with language and discourses of power. My research methods are based on detailed ethnographic fieldwork and include long semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and critical analysis of linguistic practices.</p><p> Currently I am completing a book about the gradual transformation of the Soviet society during the period of late socialism (1960s-1980s), and how the conditions created by this transformation brought about the changes of perestroika and the ultimate spectacular collapse of the Soviet system in 1991. I am also completing work on several papers on comprehensive methods of critical discourse analysis for anthropology, on the advent of the post-Soviet "entrepreneurial" identity, and on the shifts in the Russian language as a form of the post-Soviet development of private business.</p>'

S'<p>My research interests are in experimental condensed matter physics. We synthesize and characterize novel materials with unusual electronic and magnetic ground states, including low-dimensional and nanoscale structures. Examples are charge- and spin-density-wave conductors, superconductors, giant magnetoresistance materials, fullerenes, and nanotubes. Experimental characterization techniques include structural measurements (TEM, X-ray scattering) and the examination of general transport coefficients (dc and high frequency conductivity, Hall effect, thermal conductivity, thermopower), high magnetic field studies, high pressure effects, and velocity of sound. In addition we operate a high magnetic field cryogenic STM capable of manipulating and assembling individual atoms into interesting structures. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>High-temperature superconductors: We synthesize polycrystalline, single crystal, and thin film and superlattice specimens of high-Tc oxide superconductors such as Y-Ba-Cu-O, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu -O, and Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O, and perform isotope effect, intercalation, and magnetotransport studies. The goal is to understand the normal state transport and the mechanism of superconductivity. New superconductors have been synthesized and are being used to test theoretical models. Vortex (Abrikosov and Josephson) dynamics are studied in applied magnetic fields to 17.5 Tesla. </p><p>Fullerene-based conductors and superconductors: Fullerenes such as the soccer-ball-shaped molecule C60 are the basis for interesting conductors and superconductors. We intercalate C60 single crystals with alkali metals and study isotope effects (both alkali and cabon), general transport, magnetotransport, and high pressure effects. The C60 molecules can be polymerized into quasi-one-dimensional chains. These new air-stable conducting crystals display unusual phase transitions that we examine via conductivity, specific heat, x-ray scattering, and STM. </p><p>Nanotubes: It is possible to arrange carbon atoms into near-perfect nanotubes structures with diameters on the order of 10\xc3\x85 to 1000\xc3\x85 and lengths over 100\xc2\xb5m. Theoretically, these tubes are the strongest possible fiber, and they are predicted to have unusual electronic properties (some are conductors, others insulators). We fabricate carbon nanotubes and measure their structure via TEM and electrical and mechanical properties using other techniques. It is possible to fill the tubes with other atoms, and to collapse the tubes into flat, flexible ribbons. In addition, it has been predicted that nanotubes containing boron and nitrogen, BxCyNz, may have many properties superior to carbon nanotubes for applications purposes. We synthesize such tubes and study their properties. </p><p>Giant magnetoresistance materials: Materials such as La-Ba-Mn-O are semiconductor-like at high temperature and metal-like (with magnetic ground states) at low temperature. In the intermediate temperature regime (typically somewhat below room temperature), they may display an unusually large negative magnetoresistance. We study the magnetoresistance and other transport properties in order to understand the conduction and scattering mechanisms. </p><p>Atomic-scale manipulation: We have designed and constructed a unique high-speed, high-field, cryogenic UHV scanning tunneling microscope capable of assembling and measuring the electronic properties of nanoscale structures, including superconductors and nanotubes.</p><p></p>'

S'<p>Life-or-death decisions are critical for all organisms. The balance of the related biological processes determines the cell fate. Most if not all prominent human diseases are affected by the dysregulation of cell death. The mammalian cells mainly die through three types of cell death, namely apoptosis (type I), autophagy (type II) and necrosis (type III), in a programmed and regulated manner. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggest that autophagy also serves as a survival mechanism to inhibit apoptosis and necrosis. My lab studies how these programmed cell death pathways are regulated. We emphasize on the biochemical characterization of the key steps in these pathways in mammalian cells. Utilizing biochemical and genetic approaches, we seek to identify and characterize the key regulators. My long-term goal is to biochemically reconstitute these biological processes. The knowledge will help us to identify drug-able targets and screen small-molecular compounds to interfere these activities, which should provide novel therapeutic tools to human diseases including cancers and other aging related diseases.</p>'

S"<p>We are interested in the molecular mechanisms controlling HIV gene expression. Specifically, we investigate how Tat, an essential regulatory protein encoded by the HIV virus, and its host cellular cofactors regulate HIV gene expression at the stage of transcriptional elongation. The biochemical function of Tat and its cofactors is crucial for HIV replication and could potentially be a target for anti-HIV therapy. Study of Tat activation of HIV transcriptional elongation will also reveal general mechanisms of gene regulation at the stage of elongation, an important control step still poorly understood.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>The human positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, consisting of a Cdk9-cyclin T1 heterodimer, functions as a general as well as a Tat-specific transcription factor. P-TEFb activates transcription by phosphorylating RNA polymerase (Pol) II, leading to the formation of processive elongation complexes. As a Tat co-factor, P-TEFb stimulates HIV transcription by interacting with Tat and the TAR RNA structure located at the 5' end of the nascent viral transcript. </p><p>A major goal of our research is to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the P-TEFb activity in the cell. Toward this goal, we have recently identified 7SK, an abundant and evolutionarily conserved small nuclear RNA, as a specific P-TEFb-associated factor. 7SK inhibits general and Tat-specific transcriptional activities of P-TEFb by inhibiting the kinase activity of Cdk9 and preventing recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter. Under certain stress conditions, the 7SK:P-TEFb interaction is disrupted, resulting in a significant increase in HIV transcription and Pol II phosphorylation. Thus, the 7SK:P-TEFb interaction may function as a sensor to control stress-induced general and HIV-specific transcription. We are performing structure-function analyses of the 7SK:P-TEFb interaction to study the mechanism of 7SK inhibition of the Cdk9 kinase. We are also investigating the stress-induced signaling pathway controlling the 7SK:P-TEFb interaction and the possible involvement of this pathway in HIV replication and the escape from viral latency. </p><p>Another human elongation factor important for general and HIV-specific transcription is Tat-SF1. An important objective of our research is to elucidate the mechanism by which Tat-SF1 cooperates with P-TEFb to stimulate transcription. Using HIV proviral DNA as a model template, we have recently identified a role of Tat-SF1 and its associated factors in coupling transcriptional elongation and pre-mRNA splicing. Tat-SF1 interacts with spliceosomal U snRNPs to form a multi-subunit complex, which is recruited by P-TEFb to the elongating Pol II to activate both transcription and splicing. Supporting the idea that the recruitment of U snRNPs near the elongating polymerase is important for transcription, inclusion of splicing signals in the nascent transcript further stimulates polymerase elongation. Presently, we are investigating the mechanism by which the Tat-SF1-associated splicing factors stimulate transcription. </p><p>In addition to its ability to stimulate HIV transcription, Tat is also known to induce apoptosis of mainly CD4+ T cells, which may contribute in part to the progressive depletion of these cells and consequently the loss of immune competence during HIV infection. Another ongoing project in the lab seeks to understand the mechanism of Tat-induced apoptosis. We have recently discovered a specific interaction of Tat with the ab-tubulin dimer and the polymerized microtubules. This interaction alters microtubule dynamics, leading to the activation of a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway that is facilitated by the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim. We are employing a variety of biochemical and cell biology techniques to further delineate the apoptotic pathway induced by Tat-perturbation of microtubule dynamics.</p>"

S'<p>I am currently Vice-Chair for Instruction in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Chair of the Engineering Science Program at UC Berkeley. I re- ceived my Ph.D. in 1997 in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. In July 2001, I became an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I was promoted to Associate Professor in July 2004 and to Full Professor in July 2009. Prior to my appointment at the University of California, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany, and then a lecturer at the Gottfried Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany. I received my Habilitation in Mechanics from the Gottfried Leibniz University of Hannover, in 2002.</p><p>My main research interests are in micromechanical material design, particulate flow and the mechanics of high-strength fabric, with emphasis on computational approaches for nonconvex multiscale-multiphysics inverse problems, in particular addressing the crucial issue of how large numbers of micro-constituents interact to produce macroscale aggregate behavior.</p><p>I have published over 80 archival refereed journal papers and two books: (a) Introduction to computational micromechanics, Springer-Verlag (T. Zohdi and P. Wrig- gers) and (b) An introduction to modeling and simulation of particulate flows, SIAM (T. Zohdi). I have two more books currently in press: (a) Electromagnetic properties of multiphase dielectrics: a primer on modeling, theory and computation, T. I. Zohdi with Springer-Verlag and (b) Dynamics of charged particulate systems: modeling, theory and computation, T. I. Zohdi, Springer-Verlag, as well as another handbook chapter.</p><p>In 2000, I received the Zienkiewicz Prize and Medal, which are awarded once every two years, to one post-graduate researcher under the age of 35, by The Institution of Civil Engineers in London, to commemorate the work of Professor O. C. Zienkiewicz, for research which contributes most to the field of numerical methods in engineering. In 2002, I re- ceived the Best Paper of the Year 2001 Award in London, at the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Cricket Grounds, for a paper published in Engineering Computations, pertaining to modeling and simulation of the propagation of failure in particulate aggregates of material. In 2003, I received the Junior Achievement Award of the American Academy of Mechanics. The award is given once a year, to one post-graduate researcher, to recognize outstanding research during the first decade of a professional career. In 2008, I was elected Fellow of the International Association for Computational Mechanics (IACM) and in 2009 I was elected Fellow of the United Stated Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM). The USACM is the primary computational mechanics organization in the United States and the International Association for Computational Mechanics is the primary international organi- zation in this field.</p><p>In 2011, I was selected as \xe2\x80\x9dAlum of the Year\xe2\x80\x9d by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Louisiana State University (LSU), where I did my undergraduate studies. I serve on the editorial advisory boards of six international journals and I am an editor of the journal Com- putational Mechanics. I am also an editor of a book series on Computational Mechanics, published by John-Wiley. I have organized or co-organized three state of the art internationally-renown CISM workshops (International Centre For Mechanical Sciences in 2002, 2005 and 2010) located in the Palazzo del Torso in the center of Udine, Italy, which is funded by UNESCO, the National Research Council of Italy (CNR), the International Union for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) and the European Mechanics Society (EUROMECH).</p><p>In 2007, I was co-chair of the Ninth United States National Congress for Computational Mechanics, which is the largest conference in the field in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. In 2008, I was elected Secretary/Treasurer of the USACM. I then rotated to the position of Vice-President in 2010 and I will become President of the USACM in 2012. In 2009, I was elected to a 6 year term as a representative of the USACM on the General Council of the IACM, which is the governing committee of the primary international organization in my field of research.</p>'

S'<p>Synapses are not static; they are highly regulated. The strength of synaptic transmission can wax and wane after a bout of activity, and this shapes the information processing properties of neural circuits. I am fascinated by the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission.</p><p> We use biophysical methods such as control of second messengers by photolysis of light sensitive caged compounds, measurement of second messengers with fluorescent dyes, tracking of vesicle movements with vital vesicle membrane labeling dyes, and computational modeling, as well as electrophysiological techniques, to study the mechanisms underlying regulation of synaptic transmission.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>We study the <i>roles of calcium in triggering transmitter release at fast synapses, and in modulating release following prior activity.</i> Synapses are quite diverse:weak synapses transmit rarely to single action potentials and facilitate to repetitive stimulation, while strong synapses transmit effectively to single spikes and depress to a train. These differences arise from  different sensitivities to step rises in calcium concentration, imposed by photolysis of photolabile calcium chelators and measured fluorometrically from single presynaptic boutons. Theoretical modeling suggests that the different calcium sensitivities  are due in turn to different states of calcium-dependent priming of vesicles in strong and weak synapses. Presynaptic calcium not only triggers exocytosis, but also facilitates release after a single action potential, and enhances release after a train of action potentials (post-tetanic potentiation, PTP), by binding to different target molecules in presynaptic terminals. Presynaptic mitochondrial loading and sodium accumulation also play roles in PTP: the post-tetanic extrusion of calcium by sodium-calcium exchange is reversed, prolonging the enhancement of transmitter release by the lingering residual calcium leaking out of mitochondria and in from the outside.Computational simulations of calcium diffusion away from channel mouths to docked vesicles and facilitatory effectors can account for the time course of transmitter release, accumulation of facilitation in a train, and measurements of presynaptic calcium concentration. </p><p><i>Serotonin is a neuromodulator</i> of fast glutamatergic synapses, both in the brain and at crayfish neuromuscular junctions. We discovered that serotonin activates the production of cyclic AMP to open presynaptic hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide- activated (HCN) channels and activate exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) at crayfish neuromuscular junctions. These targets operate in novel pathways to enhance secretion evoked by action potentials by an actin-dependent process.  Extension of the work to <i>Drosophila</i> junctions permits the application of modern molecular genetic techniques to the study of these pathways. Planned projects include expression of fluorescent cAMP indicators in nerve terminals to track the spatio-temporal pattern of cAMP signalling, and genetic manipulations of EPAC and HCN channels in <i>Drosophila</i> to identify and characterize downstream targets. </p><p>Repetitive activity at crayfish neuromuscular junctions activates a <i>long-term facilitation (LTF)</i> of transmission. This process also depends on HCN channel activation. Sodium accumulates in nerve terminals, is extruded by an electrogenic sodium pump whose hyperpolarization activates HCN to cause LTF. LTF also requires calcium influx during stimulation, integrity of actin filaments, local presynaptic protein synthesis, protein kinases that regulate translation, and the calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of a target protein. </p><p><i>SNARE proteins</i> are involved in vesicle docking and fusion at nerve terminals, and undergo conformational changes, as well as cycles of assembly and disassembly, during exocytosis and endocytosis. We are using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect these macromolecular rearrangements essential for neurosecretion. We have detected signals that correspond to a tightening or reorganization of the SNARE complex on vesicle fusion, followed dispersion of SNARE proteins to the periphery of active zones, then disassembly of the SNARE complex prior to endocytosis, and finally the assembly of new SNARE complexes as new vesicles dock at the plasma membrane and become fully primed for release.</p>'

S'<p>I am interested in the unification of the fundamental forces of physics, i.e. of those described by the standard model of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions, and of gravity as described by Einstein\'s general relativity. The path to this unification appears to be through supersymmetry, supergravity and superstring theory. I have contributed to these subjects in the past and continue to work on them. Occasionally these studies require the use of techniques of advanced algebra and differential geometry, and my work has involved, and will continue to involve, the development of new mathematical tools. The study of noncommutative differential geometry is an example. </p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>During the past few years, in collaboration with a number of graduate students, I have been working on the mathematical properties of quantum spaces. These are spaces described by coordinates which do not commute with each other (as ordinary coordinates do). The commutation relations are covariant under coordinate transformations which generalize the usual invariances such as the Lorentz and Poincar\xc3\xa9 invariance of space-time. One can develop a differential and integral calculus for functions on quantum spaces, Fourier transforms, etc. Quantum spaces generalize in a well-defined way the superspace used in supersymmetry and supergravity. There are indications that field theory on quantum spaces in less divergent than standard quantum field theory. Quantum spaces may be relevant for a reformulation of Einstein\'s gravity theory which takes into account the microscopic structure of space-time. </p><p>Noncommutative geometry of quantum tori provides an approach to the so-called M-theory which is a "theory" encompassing all known string theories which are related to each other by duality and dimensional reduction. </p>'

S'<p>We are interested in two facets of development in the fruiting bacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus.</i> The first concerns cell-cell communication and signal transduction; the second concerns the regulation of gene expression during cellular morphogenesis and development. The Myxococcus bacterial system is particularly well suited for these studies. Myxococcus is unusual among the prokaryotes in the complexity of its multicellular behavior and morphogenetic development. Because of the simplicity of the organism, we are able to apply sophisticated genetic and molecular biological techniques to examine these processes.</p><p><b>Current Projects</b></p><p>Sensory transduction. M. xanthus moves by a mechanism called gliding motility, which is not understood. Directed movement is useful for feeding and necessary for development. We have found that sensory transduction is mediated by the "frizzy" (frz) genes. They control the rate of cell reversal during gliding. We have cloned and sequenced the frz genes, which encode the "frizzy" signal transduction proteins. These proteins contain domains that are homologous to the major chemotaxis proteins of enteric bacteria. However, significant differences exist between the Myxococcus Frz proteins and the enteric Che/MCP proteins. For example, the Frz system contains multiple CheY-like response-regulator domains, indicating a more complex regulatory pathway than that found in the enteric bacteria. While responses to repellent stimuli appear to follow the enteric paradigm, responses to attractants during vegetative swarming and development are more complex and may involve self-generated autoattractants. We are currently using the yeast two hybrid system and mutant studies to identify additional genes involved in sensory transduction in this organism. We anticipate that further analysis of the Frz proteins will give us insight into the mechanism of the elusive gliding motor. </p><p>Control of gene expression during development. Development in M. xanthus consists of the aggregation of starved cells into raised mounds and the morphogenesis of the rod shaped cells into spores. Mature mounds of spores are called fruiting bodies. Complex biochemical changes, which are part of a developmental program occur in these cells. We have been involved in the cloning, sequencing, and mutational analysis of several developmental genes. We are interested in the regulation of these genes and in specifically identifying two component signal transduction systems, cell-cell signaling pathways, and RNA polymerase interacting proteins that are critical to </p><p>developmental control. For example, we have recently identified a locus called Esp which appears to be involved in the control of timing of sporulation: mutations in espA accelerate the timing of sporulation while mutations in espB delay the timing of sporulation. We hypothesize that EspA functions as an inhibitor of sporulation during early fruiting body formation while cells are aggregating into raised mounds. EspB would then function to counter this inhibitor. EspA contains a histidine protein kinase domain and a fork head associated domain important for certain protein-protein interactions. We are currently using molecular and genetic techniques to search for other members of this interesting signal transduction pathway.</p>'
