S'<p>Intracellular pathogens, such as Listeria, Shigella, Rickettsia, and Vaccinia virus, display actin-based motility and spread from cell to cell through the<br>formation of plasma membrane protrusions. Although several virulence factors involved in actin-based motility have been identified, their interaction with the host cell machinery is still poorly understood. We have developed systematic<br>approaches to determine the host cell factors required for intracellular pathogen spread in human cells. The approach may not only lead to the identification of mechanisms underlying microbial pathogenesis, but may also uncover the native<br>function of the identified host factors. An additional focus of the lab is to determine the role of cytokine signaling in the maintenance of epithelium integrity<br>and the control of the rate of stem cell division in response to bacterial infection.

We investigate the molecular aspects of tsetse  immunity during parasite transmission with the eventual goal of manipulating  these responses to block disease transmission. Tsetse also harbors three  maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts, which influence its nutritional  and reproductive biology. We characterize the biology of each symbiont using  biochemical, genetic, cellular and molecular techniques to understand the  evolution and functional significance of each in the context of the dynamic  host environment. We developed a paratransgenic approach where we exploit  the commensal gut flora to express in the midgut mileu trypanocidal products  that can block parasite development. The replacement of natural tsetse populations  with the engineered parasite refractory flies can provide a novel approach  for control of this devastating vector-borne disease.</p><p>Dr. Aksoy's research aims to understand the biology of host-pathogeninteractions; in particular in tsetse flies, which transmit Africantrypanosomes and harbor multiple symbiotic microbes.

S'<p>The Arnsten lab studies molecular influences on higher cognitive function, with the aim of developing rational therapies for mental illness and for age-related cognitive decline. The work focuses on the prefrontal cortex, a highly evolved brain region that creates our "Mental Sketchpad", allowing us abstract reasoning, high order decision-making, working memory, and thoughtful regulation of attention, behavior and emotion (including inhibition of inappropriate thoughts, actions and feelings). The Arnsten lab has discovered powerful chemical signaling pathways that can\xc2\xa0impair prefrontal function, e.g. when we are stressed, as well as protective pathways that maintain strong cognitive function. These pathways are altered by normal aging, and can be genetically altered in mental illness. Based on research in the Arnsten lab, two medications have been developed for human use: guanfacine (Intuniv) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and prazosin for the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p><p>The Arnsten Lab studies molecular influences on the higher cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the overarching goal of developing rational treatments for cognitive disorders and mental illness. The lab uses a multi-disciplinary approach to understand mechanisms influencing working memory at the cellular and behavioral levels. Research has focused on how the arousal pathways rapidly alter PFC network strength through intracellular signaling mechanisms, a process termed Dynamic Network Connectivity. Our data explain how exposure to stress causes the rapid loss of PFC cognitive abilities, and how genetic mutations in molecules that regulate these pathways can lead to symptoms of mental illness. Dysregulation of these pathways also contributes to cognitive decline and loss of neuronal firing with normal aging. Understanding these mechanisms has led to successful new treatments for patients with PFC dysfunction, including medications for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a potential treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</p>'

S'<p>The Beardsley laboratory is involved in what may be termed molecular pharmacology.  We are interested in how drugs work at the most basic level, largely structurally  and chemically oriented. We have two major themes: 1. The structure and function  of folate-metabolizing enzymes and their role as targets for antifolate drug  development. This has involved cloning, sequence determination, and expression  of these proteins followed by functional and structural studies using site  directed mutagenesis, irreversible active site directed inhibitors, transient  phase kinetics, NMR spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and x-ray crystallography.  The goal of these investigations is to understand the details of how these  enzymes work, and to be able to design and test inhibitors as potential therapeutic  agents. 2. Functional consequences of DNA structural lesions. Abnormalities  in the structure of DNA have potentially very profound biological consequences.  We have been exploring the nature of many DNA structural anomalies, focusing  on those which are produced by misincorporation of nucleoside analog anti-cancer  or anti-viral agents. The methodology generally involves chemical synthesis  of DNA oligomers containing the lesion at specific sites, followed by structural  studies done by NMR and x-ray crystallography and biochemical studies of  the functional consequences.</p><p>Study of RNA helicases required for ribosome biogenesis and their cofactors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestigations into the role of ribosome biogenesis in cell cycle regulation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovery of a subset of SSU processome proteins that are associated with the rDNA and are required for rDNA transcription\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tidentifyingsubcomplexes of the SSU processome and deciphering the directprotein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that mediate their assembly\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurification and electron microscopy to visualize pre-ribosomes\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacterization of an essential new protein-protein interaction motif found in RNA processing RNPs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloping a method to identify individual proteins in chromatin spreads.<br><br><span>Using innovative proteomics techniques, my laboratory has recentlyidentified the protein components of a large nucleolarribonucleoprotein that is required for processing of the 18S smallsubunit rRNA. This RNP, which we termed the SSU processome, is composedof the U3 snoRNA and 40 proteins. Currently, projects in the lab areaimed at determining the architecture of this RNP and the functions ofindividual proteins in 18S processing. We approach this question fromseveral perspectives, using genetic and biochemical methods to identifydirect interactions between components, and cryo electron microscopy tovisualize the complex in three dimensions. <br><br>Through these studies wehave discovered and characterized several unique protein motifs andtheir specific roles in rRNA processing. We have recently discoveredthat a subset of the SSU processome proteins are associated with therDNA and are required for rDNA transcription. Stemming from this idea,we are interested in studying the proteins which regulate transcriptionof the rDNA by Pol I and initiate the processing of the rRNA. We havelearned that these steps are intimately linked, and endeavor todescribe this complex process in detail. Seventeen putative RNAhelicases have been shown to be required for processing of the smalland large ribosomal subunit RNAs, perhaps by remodeling the rRNA toallow access to cleavage sites. Ongoing genetic and biochemical studiesin the lab examine the roles of each putative RNA helicase and test itsability to unwind RNA. Through these projects, we strive to ascertainhow and why the helicases are required at each step in ribosomebiogenesis. Because ribosomes are essential to cell growth via theproduction of new proteins, we are studying the role of ribosomebiogenesis in cell cycle regulation. <br><br>We have previously shown that rRNAmaturation by the SSU processome is required for cell cycleprogression, indicating that the production of ribosomes has a distinctinfluence on the cell cycle. Specifically, we seek to find theribosome-regulated trigger that allows the cell to progress through thecell cycle, grow in size, and divide. Transcription of the rDNA andprocessing of the rRNA can be visualized in Miller chromatin spreads,as shown here. In a, the SSU processome corresponds to the terminalknobs at the end of each rRNA branching off the rDNA. When componentsof the SSU processome are depleted (the U3 snoRNA in b, or the Utp7protein in c), the knobs are no longer present, due to incompleteformation of the SSU processome.</span></p>'

S'<p><strong>Basic Research<br></strong>Purine transport and metabolism in P. falciparum. P. falciparum cannot synthesize purine nucleotides de novo, and therefore the purine salvage pathway provides an indispensable nutritional function for the parasite and offers the prospect of selective therapeutic manipulation of malaria. The first step in purine acquisition by P. falciparum is the translocation of host purines into the parasite. P. falciparum has four putative purine transporter genes, PfNT1, PfNT2, PfNT3, and PfNT4. A major effort in the lab is to investigate the role of these transporters in parasite\xe2\x80\x99s intraerythrocytic development and survival.<br>&nbsp;<br>Membrane biogenesis in P. falciparum. During its 48-h asexual life cycle within human erythrocytes, P. falciparum grows to many times its own original size and divides to produce 16-32 new parasites. This rapid multiplication requires active synthesis of new membranes and is fueled by phospholipid precursors and fatty acids that are scavenged from plasma. A major focus of our research is to investigate the mechanism of membrane biogenesis and identification of enzymes that play an important role in Plasmodium growth, replication and sexual differentiation. <br><br><strong>Therapy Program<br></strong>Our therapy program builds upon the findings of our basic research program.

Four species of Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax) are known to be infectious to humans, and more recent cases of infection due to P. knowlesi have also been reported. These species cause approximately 300 - 500 million annual cases of clinical malaria resulting in 1.5 - 2.7 million deaths.

Our goal is to identify and characterize the events that initiate synapse formation and the steps that lead to its completion.</p><p>Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms of synapse formation in the vertebrate brain. In development, neurons form pre- and postsynaptic membrane specializations at sites of contact to assemble synapses. We know little about this critical process, in contrast to our understanding of structure and function of mature synapses. To address this question, we focus on the roles of SynCAM proteins. SynCAMs are a family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules that assemble into adhesive complexes at nascent synapses. They bridge the synaptic cleft and drive formation of new synapses. SynCAMs therefore are likely to act early in synapse differentiation. Our questions are first, how they demarcate sites of future synaptic specializations, and second, how synapse formation is coordinated across the synaptic cleft in time and space. In our studies, we employ biochemical, molecular biological, and optical imaging techniques. In addition, we analyze this process in vivo using mouse genetics.</p>'

S'<p>To characterize the development and function of regulatory T cells and characterize mechanisms that affect autoimmunity, inflammation, transplantation and recruitment into vascular sites.</p><p>Theresearch goals of the lab are to characterize the development and function ofregulatory T cells and characterize mechanisms that affect autoimmunity,inflammation, transplantation and recruitment into vascular sites.&nbsp; Both mouse and human responses arestudied in vitro and in vivo which includes the development and use ofhumanized mice.&nbsp; In addition, ourexperience with synthetic microvessels has lead to a translational project torevascularize islets to treat type I diabetes.<br><br>Specificaccomplishments in the last year: <br><ul><li>PPARs:&nbsp; Peroxysome proliferated activatedreceptors (PPARs) represent a group of transcription factors that are criticalin regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Ligands of PPARg &nbsp;inhibitmetabolically induced arteriosclerosis and also prevent the development ofinflammatory disorders in several experimental mouse models including EAE,asthma, rheumatic arthritis and sepsis. The role of PPARg in graft arteriosclerosis (GA) has not beencharacterized. We therefore tested the in vivo effects of administration of theendogenously occurring ligand, 15 deoxy-prostaglandin-J2 (15-d-PGJ2),and ciglitazone and pioglitazone&nbsp;on vascular remodeling of human artery induced by alloreactive PBMC andthe IFN-g model. The data indicate that15-d-PGJ2 and pioglitazone significantly inhibit human GA in our invivo human arterialgraft model in immunodeficient mice. These effects appear specific because theyare reversed by treatment with an antagonist, GW9662.&nbsp; Preliminary results suggest that it is possible to reversedisease once it is established for 3 weeks in this model.&nbsp; </li></ul><ul><li>MicroorganIslet Grafts: The goal of this project is to bioengineer pancreatic betacell-containing implants for treatment of diabetes. Casting the islets togetherwith EC in collagen gels effectively revascularizes the islets in SCID/bg mice.Indeed, our pilot data indicate that these human islet-EC microorgans secretehuman insulin into the peripheral blood of mice for periods of at least 4months and demonstrate responsiveness to glucose in glucose tolerance tests. Weare characterizing the structure/function properties of these microorgans indetail, including the microvessel structure and the stability of themicrovessels with time. During the last year we (with Serge Kobsa and M.Saltzman)&nbsp; are characterizing newnanospheres that have a greater capacity to secrete factors for longer periodsof time. We have shown that Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) has significantanti-apoptotic activity on islets in vitro and hope to evaluate this with thenew delivery systems in vivo. Inflammationand Colon Cancer: The APC/Min mouse is a highly studied model of intestinaltumorigenesis. During the last year we have shown that APC/Min mice that aredeficient in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A have a 90% reduction in smallintestinal polyps.&nbsp; We hope todefine both the source of the IL-17A that is critical as well as the cell typethat is the target of this cytokine.&nbsp;</li></ul></p>'

S'<p>Cancer begins as an encounter between a carcinogen and a gene. We are pinpointing these early events, which occur decades before the appearance of a tumor. Our past work on sunlight-induced mutations in tumor suppressor genes has led us to three current topics: 1) <span>Exploring how UVB-induced apoptosis and UV-driven cell fate decisions drive a single mutant cell to clonally expand.</span> 2) Determining rates of DNA photoproduct formation and repair across the genome using tiling micorarrays. 3) The interaction of UV and melanin in causing melanoma.</p><p>The story thus far, from photons up to cells: UV leads to mutations atthe site of DNA photoproducts (rather than elevating genomicinstability); the important photoproducts are cyclobutane dimers and(6-4) photoproducts, which join adjacent cytosines or thymines; onlythe cytosine mutates; these unique properties create a characteristic"mutation signature" for UV that can be seen in tumors decades later;sunlight mutates the P53 and PTCH genes in non-melanoma skin cancer;P53 is required for UV-induced apoptosis, which prevents mutations;apoptosis is signaled by DNA photoproducts in actively transcribedgenes and by a product of UV-irradiated melanin; another<span>cause of apoptosis is exposure of melanin to sunlight, particularly themelanin found in blonde and red hair; </span>and our sun-exposed skin carries about 60,000 tiny clones ofP53-mutant keratinocytes. Expansion of single mutant cells into clonesis due to physiology rather than a 2nd mutation: UV-induced apoptosisdeletes normal progenitor cells while sparing the mutant ones. UV also tilts the progenitor cell\'s fate decision toward self-renewal rather than differentiation.&nbsp; Now, the lab is in the midst ofsome "functional genomics" questions:<br><ul><li><span>How does a single mutant keratinocyte expand into a clone? We are attempting to track the clonal expansion of mutant stem cells in a livingmouse. <br></span></li><li><span>What DNA regions are the most important UV targets? In addition toactively-transcribed genes, we find that telomreres are UV-sensitive and fail to repair this damage. We\'ve developed a method to measure UVphotoproducts and repair in specific genomic regions such as telomeres, and across the entire genome. <br></span></li><li><span>Is cancerdevelopment in melanoma unique because of its melanin? We are looking at howreactive oxygen species from UV-irradiated melanin affect epigenetic andgenetic fidelity, as well as whether protection against these events variesbetween individuals due to polymorphisms in radical-scavenging genes.</span></li></ul></p>'

This is the question that has been the focus of ourresearch program. The first step in the energy-transduction process isthe light-induced charge-separation reaction that occurs in amembrane-protein complex called the photoreaction center. Thereafter, aseries of rapid electron-transfer reactions serve to stabilize thecharge-separated state. Later still, the photochemically-producedoxidant and reductant are consumed in the oxidation of water and thereduction of carbon dioxide. One of the primary targets of our researchis the plant enzyme called photosystem II that catalyzes the oxidationof water to dioxygen at a site within the enzyme containing atetranuclear manganese cluster. Photosystem II is one of two reactioncenter complexes that initiate the light-driven electron transferreactions of plant photosynthesis. The long-term objective of ourresearch is to develop an understanding at the molecular level of theconversion of light energy into chemical energy in plantphotosynthesis. Toward this goal, we are pursuing several related linesof research. A major effort involves biophysical studies of thepurified photosystem II complex itself. We use spectroscopic andbiophysical methods to probe the structure of the redox centers, thekinetics and yields of electron-transfer reactions, and the chemistryof water oxidation in photosystem II. Our aim is to define how Naturehas solved the difficult problem of the efficient light-driven,four-electron oxidation of water to O2. It is hoped that these studieswill provide insight into the design of artificial systems that splitwater. Toward this goal, we are also investigating inorganic models ofthe manganese site in photosystem II. Because the model complexes aremore easily characterized, the inorganic studies provide importantinformation that can aid the interpretation of results from thebiological system. On the other hand, the information from thebiophysical studies better define the nature of the catalytic manganesecomplex that is to be modeled. The synergism between the inorganic andbiological chemistry is an important aspect of this research. A third area of research is artificial photosynthesis.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; working to develop artificialprocesses that use solar energy for fuel production in collaboration withProfessors Batista, Crabtree and Schmuttenmaer.

Integrin-dependent cellular activities such as adhesion,<br>migration, proliferation, and survival rely upon the dynamic interaction of<br>integrin cytoplasmic tails with intracellular integrin tail-binding proteins.<br><br>We use cell-biological, biochemical, and structural techniques to identify and<br>characterize the interactions of integrin cytoplasmic tails with intracellular<br>ligands, and to decipher how these interactions are regulated. This has allowed<br>us to establish talin as a key regulator of integrin activation; to show that<br>integrin binding to the actin crosslinking protein filamin controls cell<br>migration and modulates integrin-talin interactions; to reveal that kindlins<br>modulate talin-mediated integrin activation in an integrin-specific fashion;<br>and to characterize interactions of the integrin-linked kinase. Ongoing studies<br>aim to extend these observations, to characterize the molecular basis and<br>functional significance of new interactions between integrin cytoplasmic tails<br>and cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, and to identify novel mechanisms by<br>which specific integrin-associated proteins are regulated.<br></p><p>Integrins are essential heterodimeric adhesion receptors formed by the non-covalent association of a and \xc3\x9f subunits. Each subunit is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that has relatively large extracellular domains and a generally short cytoplasmic tail. Humans contain 18 a and 8 \xc3\x9f subunits that combine to produce at least 24 different heterodimers, each of which can bind to a specific repertoire of cell surface, ECM or soluble protein ligands. Cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion is mediated by the binding of integrin extracellular domains to diverse protein ligands, however, cellular control of these adhesive interactions and their translation into dynamic cellular responses, such as cell spreading or migration, requires the integrin cytoplasmic tails. These short tails bind to intracellular ligands that connect the receptors to signaling pathways and cytoskeletal networks. Hence, by binding both extracellular and intracellular ligands, integrins provide a transmembrane link for the bidirectional transmission of mechanical force and biochemical signals across the plasma membrane.<br><br>We have found that talin binds to integrin \xc3\x9f subunit cytoplasmic tails through the FERM domain within the talin head.&nbsp;Integrin binding occurs via a variant of the classical PTB domain-NPxY interaction and, in addition to linking integrins to actin stress fibers, this interaction induces conformational changes in the integrin ectodomains that regulate integrin ligand-binding affinity (integrin activation). Tight regulation of integrin activation is essential because it controls cell adhesion, migration, and assembly of an extracellular matrix. Hence integrin activation is a critical step in angiogenesis, tumor cell metastasis, embryonic development, cardiac function and the immune response, and cellular control of integrin activation plays important roles in health and disease throughout development and during the course of adult life. <br><br>More recently we have investigated the binding of another class of FERM domain<br>proteins, the kindlins. Kindlins, like talins, contain an atypical FERM domain and we predict them to be structurally closely related to the integrin-activating talin head domain. We find that kindlins bind integrin \xc3\x9f tails and regulate integrin activation and signaling. The molecular and structural basis for kindlins effects on integrins are the subject of ongoing work. <br><br>We have also found that actin cross-linking proteins of the filamin family (filamin A, B and C) bind integrin \xc3\x9f tails, that tight association of filamin with integrin \xc3\x9f tails inhibits cell migration and that filamins can inhibit integrin activation. The regulated binding of filamin to integrin \xc3\x9f tails may therefore provide a control point for regulation of cell migration. Our structural analyses of filamin-integrin interactions revealed the basis for integrin binding and identified regulatory mechanisms including, competition with talin (which provides a mechanism by which filamin binding can suppress integrin activation), auto-inhibition by adjacent filamin domains (which may be released by mechanical stretching) and competition with other filamin-binding proteins. &nbsp;Recently we have shown that filamins are important for initiation of cell migration and that during cell differentiation filamin levels can be controlled by poly-ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. Investigations of the molecular bases for these effects are underway.<br><br>Finally we have initiated structural and functional studies on the integrin-linked kinase (ILK); a signaling protein implicated in both integrin activation, possibly through interactions with kindlins, and in signaling downstream of integrins. In collaboration with the Boggon Lab (Pharmacology, Yale) we have solved the structures of a complex between the ILK ankyrin-repeat domain and the 1st LIM domain of the ILK-binding protein PINCH1 or PINCH2. These structures revealed the molecular basis of ILK-PINCH interactions, which are essential for targeting of ILK-PINCH-parvin heterotrimeric complexes to adhesion sites where they act as key signaling nodes. Ongoing structural and functional studies focus on other ILK domains as well as larger multi-domain complexes.</p>'

S'<p>The main interest in our laboratory is to elucidate thestructure-function and regulation of ion channels from theENaC/Degenerin family specifically by a set of S/T kinases known asglococorticoid-induced kinases (Sgk). Some of these channels such asENaC are expressed in kidney where they retain sodium and thereby arekey contributors for the maintenance and regulation of blood pressure.The mammalian Degenerins or ASICs are channels expressed in theperipheral and central nervous system where they may regulate membraneexcitability and thus contribute to many neuronal processes. We employa broad variety of approaches that include molecular and cellbiological techniques and electrophysiological measurements of channelactivity by patch clamp techniques on cultured cells and tissues. Wealso develop mouse models expressing mutant channels or Sgk kinases toexamine the physiological and pathophysiological consequences ofaltered channel function in blood pressure and in the nervous system.</p><p>Inour laboratory we examine the structure, function and regulation of twotypes of sodium channels: the Epithelial Na + Channel (ENaC) and AcidSensing Ion Channels (ASIC). These proteins are structurally relatedbut serve very different functions. ENaC is expressed in the apicalside of epithelial cells involved in sodium absorption such as inkidney, lung and colon. Mutations in the human ENaC genes producedisorders of whole-body sodium balance and are characterized byhypertension or sodium wasting. Our current work centers on mechanismsthat regulate activity, expression and traffic of ENaC in epithelialcells specifically, on the role of a kinase known as serum-andglucocorticoid-induced kinase or Sgk1.<br><br>TheASICs are expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervoussystems. External protons gate ASIC but other stimuli are likely to bemore important physiological agonists.

Our work centers in theelucidation of the biophysical properties and gating of ASICs from manyvertebrate species.<br><br>Weuse a broad range of experimental approaches and techniques thatinclude electrophysiology (patch-clamp, two-electrode voltage clamp,short-circuit current), cloning of channels from evolutionary distantspecies, modifications of channels and their expression in oocytes,cell lines and in mice either trangenics or knockins.</p>'

This process requires a complex array of eventsinvolving rearrangement of cell shape and regulation of cell-matrix andcell-cell interactions. By examining epithelial cell adhesion,migration, and branching tubulogenesis in response to growth factorssuch as Hepatocyte Growth Factor and Epidermal Growth Factor, we aredetermining the intracellular signaling events critical for tubuleformation during kidney development and following injury.

S'<p>The surface membranes of epithelial cells are divided into domains characterized by dramatically different protein compositions. Membrane proteins whose distributions are restricted to one of these domains must incorporate information that specifies their appropriate destinations. We seek to determine how this information is encoded and how it is interpreted. <br><br>Our studies of cellular trafficking focus on proteins involved in ion transport, as well as on the proteins associated with polycystic kidney disease. Polycystic kidney disease is caused by mutations in genes encoding polycystin-1 and 2. We have found that polycystin-1 undergoes a proteolytic cleavage that releases its cytoplasmic C terminal tail. <br><br>This fragment is transported to the nucleus, where it appears to modulate several signaling pathways. This behavior may account for the capacity of polycystin-1 to participate in communication between the cell surface and the nucleus.</p><p>Work in the Caplan laboratory is focused on understanding how membrane proteins are sorted to the appropriate cell surface domains of polarized epithelial cells. One of the proteins whose trafficking we study is the Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, which generates the ion gradients responsible for most fluid and electrolyte transport processes in the kidney. The Na,K-ATPase must be restricted to the basolateral surfaces of renal tubule epithelial cells. Much remains to be learned about the partner proteins and trafficking pathways that determine the sodium pump\xe2\x80\x99s subcellular distribution and modulate its activity. We have adapted a novel labeling methodology to investigate the attributes of temporally defined cohorts of Na,K-ATPase. <br><br>We can observe directly the trafficking itinerary pursued by newly synthesized Na,K-ATPase and isolate newly synthesized Na,K-ATPase in association with its collections of partner proteins.&nbsp; We find that the basolateral delivery of newly synthesized Na,K-ATPase occurs via a pathway distinct from that pursued by other basolateral membrane proteins.&nbsp; We have also detected interactions between the Na,K-ATPase a-subunit and a collection of novel partner proteins that may govern the pump\xe2\x80\x99s trafficking properties. Thus, we have developed tools that permit us to evaluate the trafficking pathways and partner proteins that govern the post-synthetic sorting and regulation of the epithelial Na,K-ATPase.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>We also study a common genetic disease that dramatically alters the structure and function of polarized epithelial cells. In Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) the normal architecture of the kidney tubules is replaced by large fluid filled cysts, which can ultimately result in renal failure. ADPKD is caused by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes, which encode the polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 proteins, respectively. Both of these proteins are targeted to cilia in polarized epithelial cells. We have found that polycystin-1 undergoes such a proteolytic cleavage that releases its C-terminal tail (CTT), which enters the nucleus and initiates signaling processes. The cleavage occurs in vivo in association with alterations in mechanical stimuli that may be communicated by signaling through the cilium. The C-terminal tail fragment of polycystin-1 participates in a complex with \xc3\x9f-catenin and acts to profoundly inhibit canonical \xc3\x9f-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling. The polycystin-1 C-terminal tail fragment also appears to modulate gene expression, and may induce expression of cilia-related proteins in renal epithelial cells. <br><br>We find that all of the signal transduction machinery found in the cilia of olfactory epithelial cells is present in renal epithelial cells. Our data suggest that olfactory receptors and proteins involved in olfactory signal transduction may play a role in regulating renal flow or transport in response to chemosensory cues.</p>'

S'<p><p>Our research encompasses laboratory and field based studies of parasitic diseases that affect children in developing countries. Much of this work has focused on bloodfeeding hookworms, intestinal nematodes that infect over one billion people worldwide. Using molecular, immunological, and biochemical techniques, we aim to isolate and characterize specific hookworm virulence factors that play a role in parasite survival and disease pathogenesis. Ultimately, these hookworm factors represent novel targets for a vaccine-based strategy aimed at reducing the ability of adult hookworms to feed on blood. We are also engaged in collaborative field studies in Africa and Latin American aimed at characterizing human immune responses to intestinal nematode infections, as well as developing novel molecular methods for diagnosis and monitoring of control programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Research in our laboratory encompasses two broaddisciplines. Our primary interest has been the pathogenesis ofparasitic helminth infections. The majority of this work involveslaboratory investigations aimed at characterizing the pathogenesis ofhookworm infection, a leading cause of anemia and malnutrition indeveloping countries. Over the past decade, we have studied how adulthookworms, bloodfeeding nematode parasites, evade host defenses inorder to feed successfully while attached to the intestinal mucosa. Anumber of novel hookworm proteins secreted at the site of attachmenthave been isolated and/or cloned, including anticoagulants, plateletinhibitors, immunomodulatory compounds (including a homologue of humancytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor), and tissue degradingproteases. Using a model of infection with the human and animalhookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum,it has alsobeen demonstrated that immunization with single recombinant antigensconfers partial protection against anemia and/or growth delay. Thisdiscovery further establishes the proof of concept for development of avaccine that may impact the health of hundreds of millions of peopleworldwide. In addition to our work on hookworm pathogenesis, we haverecently established field based immunoepidemiologic studies aimed atcharacterizing host immune responses to hookworm infection in endemiccountries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.&nbsp; <br><br>A second focus of our laboratory research is aimed atcharacterizing the anti-thrombotic mechanisms of hematophagousinvertebrates, studies which have been carried out in conjunction withcollaborators working in a variety of biological systems. To date, wehave characterized novel anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors fromhookworms, schistosomes, tsetse flies, and Ixodes ticks. Thesecollaborative studies may ultimately lead to the identification ofnovel targets for preventing diseases caused or transmitted bybloodfeeding parasites, including hookworm anemia, schistosomiasis,sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis), and tick-borne infections.In addition, these parasite antithrombotics may also representpotential therapeutic agents for \xe2\x80\x9cfirst world\xe2\x80\x9d diseases associated withthrombosis, including heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This work hasbeen supported through grants from the American Heart Association, andthe Charles Hood Foundation. <br><br>The long range goal of our research program is to advancethe field of helminthology by identifying novel parasite virulencefactors and characterizing host immune responses. In addition, webelieve that anti-thrombotics isolated from hematophagous invertebrateshold great promise as therapeutic agents for the treatment and/orprevention of a variety of cardiovascular conditions.</p>'

These chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestine affect children and young adults and are associated with significant morbidity. We have utilized genome-wide association approaches to identify common variants contributing to disease. We have established central roles for the interleukin 23 pathway, autophagy, and host recognition of innate immune bacterial signals (NOD2 pathway) in disease pathogenesis. Of particular interest is the identification of multiple, independent signals within the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) as being associated with both Crohn\xe2\x80\x99s disease and ulcerative colitis. It is known that intact, wild-type IL-23 pathway function is required to mediate multiple murine models of intestinal inflammation.

S'<p><span><strong>The plant innate immune system</strong> is constantly evolving at the interface between the plant host and microbe, and this adaptation includes both the cell surface surveillance of perceived pathogens through their microbe-associated molecular patterns, or MAMPs, and the production of defense-related secondary metabolites. The former is a conserved strategy of eukaryotic innate immune systems while the latter is a hallmark response of the plant innate immune system, which relies more heavily on diversified chemical defenses than those of motile organisms. The Clay lab is focused on understanding the molecular basis for the adaptive diversification of the plant innate immune system, which is based on the perception and production of small molecules, and rivals the mammalian innate immune system in combating pathogenic infections. In particular, we are interested in understanding how pathogen discrimination is achieved through molecular pattern recognition, and how the chemical outcomes of secondary metabolic pathways are diversified and functionalized.</span></p><p><strong>Chromatin dynamics and epigenetic control in the immune system</strong><br><ul><li>Chromatinstructure dictates whether a DNA template is accessible to nuclearproteins, and is thus a focal point of gene regulation by signalingpathways.

We have worked on two variations of an optical method for measuring brain activity; both utilize voltage-sensitive or Calcium-sensitive dyes and a fast camera with frame rates of 1 kHz or a 2-photon microscope. In the first variation, we use the dyes and a 2-photon microscope to follow the spike activity of individual neurons, and in favorable preparations about 500 individual neurons can be monitored simultaneously. We hope that monitoring many neurons simultaneously will improve our understanding about how nervous systems are organized to generate behaviors. In the second variation, each pixel in the recording receives light from a large number of neurons and processes (e.g. from an area of cortex 20 um x 20 um) and thus each signal represents the average of a population of neurons. There are several interesting aspects of vertebrate brain function where populations are involved. <br></span></span></p><p><strong>Chromatin dynamics and epigenetic control in the immune system</strong><br><ul><li>Chromatinstructure dictates whether a DNA template is accessible to nuclearproteins, and is thus a focal point of gene regulation by signalingpathways.

S'<p>The human brain consists of 100 billion neurons and over 100 trillionsynapses. The ability of a neuron to find its correct target in thiscomplex environment is critical for the formation of the circuits thatunderlie human behavior. How do neurons discriminate between a plethoraof target choices to form precise synaptic connections and assemblespecific neural circuits?<br><br>We have established a system in the <em>C. elegans </em>nerve ring (the nematode brain) to study this question. In <em>C. elegans</em>we can visualize synapse development in vivo with single cellresolution, and use genetic and cell biological tools to dissect themolecular and cellular components required for the development of thenematode brain. Using this system we discovered that glial cells arerequired for the assembly of behavioral circuits in the brain. To ourknowledge this is the first evidence that glial cells can specifyprecise neural connectivity <em>in vivo</em>. <br><br>We also discovered anovel function for the Netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC in directing synaptictargeting. These findings prompt the following questions: How does theNetrin receptor direct synapse formation? How do glial cellsorchestrate circuit assembly in the brain? What other molecular signalsgovern synaptic targeting in the nematode brain? Our lab will couplegenetic, molecular and biochemical techniques to identify the signalsthat direct precise circuit connectivity in the nematode brain.</p><p><strong>Chromatin dynamics and epigenetic control in the immune system</strong><br><ul><li>Chromatinstructure dictates whether a DNA template is accessible to nuclearproteins, and is thus a focal point of gene regulation by signalingpathways. External signals often mobilize "chromatin remodelingcomplexes (CRC)" and histone modifying enzymes to reversiblyreconfigure chromatin, but the altered chromatin states can sometimesbe maintained and propagated to daughter cells after the cessation ofthe signaling event. This latter effect enables transient signals toheritably or "epigenetically" modify gene function without altering DNAsequences, thus providing a molecular basis for cellular memory andlineage differentiation. On the other hand, misdirected epigeneticcontrols are now recognized to underlie many human diseases. Forexample, during cancer development, tumor suppressor genes often becomeinactivated by "epimutations" characterized by aberrant chromatinrather than by classic DNA mutations. Epimutations also explainphenotypic differences between genetically identical twins, betweencloned and original animals, and explain the high incidents of birthdefects in "test tube babies". Epimutations that occur in the germlinecan be transmitted across generations, which has been inferred fromepidemiological studies of human diseases and directly demonstrated inanimal models. Epigenetics has thus emerged as a new frontier inbiology, with far-reaching implications. Our long-term goals are toreveal fundamental principles in chromatin biology and epigenetics, andto define how such principles underpin the development and function ofthe immune system. Below are some of the problems we are tackling: </li><li>How do external signals mobilize CRC? The current dogma is thatsignaling pathways impinge on CRC indirectly, by controllingtranscription factors which then recruit CRC to target genes viaphysical interactions. Our recent dataindicate that the Swi/Snf-like BAF complex, the prototypical mammalianCRC, is subject to a novel mode of regulation. Specifically, Toll-likereceptor (TLR) signaling in macrophages is found to activate theubiquitous signaling molecule calmodulin (CaM), which then directlybinds the BAF complex and stimulates BAF-dependent remodeling andexpression of target genes essential for the innate immune response.Given that both CaM and BAF complex are ubiquitously expressed, thisnovel pathway, connecting cell surface receptors to chromatin, shouldoperate in diverse tissues beyond macrophages and thus be of generalimportance. We have also developed cell permeable peptides that caneffectively disrupt CaM-BAF interaction and block the innate immuneresponse in animal models. These inhibitors provide a powerful meansfor dissecting and manipulating this novel signaling pathway, withimportant implications in basic and clinical research.  </li><li>Novel functions of the BAF complex. Although called "CRC", the BAFcomplex, like other CRC, carries multiple subunits totally dispensablefor remodeling in vitro. Our hypothesis is that the BAF complex hasnovel functions in gene regulation unrelated to remodeling. To testthis, we have developed a general strategy to engineer tissue-specificpoint mutations in mice. Our data confirm our hypothesis. So far, wehave found that the complex uses ATPase-independent activities tostimulate CD4 expression and promote the survival of regulatory Tcells. We are studying the molecular basis of such mysterious functions. </li><li>How do transient signals trigger heritable changes in gene function?The signals are thought to imprint on histones certainposttranslational modifications or "epigenetic tags" which aresubsequently maintained and transmitted to daughter cells independentlyof the initial signals.

We look at theprocess of tumor development and tumor progression at the systems levelin an attempt to understand the role played by somatic cell genetics,gene function, environment, and chance. Results obtained during thelast decade indicate that during the pre-tumoral stage diversity amongsomatic cells is maintained by mutation and drift and that certainclones expand under the strength of selection and the influence ofdisturbance. Although the majority of clones harboring mutationsdisappear, diversity is constantly generated by background levels ofspontaneous mutation. In contrast, in overt tumors that often exhibit a\xe2\x80\x9cmutator phenotype,\xe2\x80\x9d diversity is maintained by rules that arereminiscent of the ecological principles that govern diversity inmacroscopic systems.

Peptide binding releases theclass I molecules from the \xe2\x80\x9cpeptide loading complex\xe2\x80\x9d, and&nbsp; a disulfide-linked dimer of tapasin and ERp57 within thecomplex catalyzes peptide loading.

Calnexin, calreticulin and ERp57 are also involvedin the assembly of CD1d molecules, which bind lipids. </p><p><p>The main interests of this laboratory are in two areas; antigenprocessing and the mechanisms of action of antiviral proteinsstimulated by interferons. Studies of MHC class I molecules center ontwo problems. The first is the mechanism(s) governing the associationof antigen-derived peptides with class I molecules in the endoplasmicreticulum (ER). Peptides are transported into the ER by the Transporterassociated with Antigen Processing (TAP) after their generation fromcytosolic proteins by proteasomal degradation. Peptide binding occursin the context of the peptide loading complex, which consists of TAP,an associated transmembrane glycoprotein called tapasin, and anassociated 'empty' class I molecule which is a heterodimer of the classI heavy chain and \xc3\x9f2microglobulin. Also in the complex are twohousekeeping molecules, the chaperone calreticulin which associateswith the glycan on the class I heavy chain, and ERp57, a thioloxidoreductase that is disulfide linked to tapasin. How the peptideloading complex promotes peptide loading of class I molecules at themolecular level is under intensive investigation, but it is clear that the tapasin-ERp57 heterodimer is critically involved in peptide binding and the process of peptide editing, which ensures that MHC class I molecules associate with peptides of the highest affinity before leaving the ER for the cell surface.</p>"

Synapses are specialized contact sites between neurons, or between neurons and muscles, where electrical signals are propagated from cell to cell via chemical intermediates called neurotransmitters. Our long-term goal is to advance the understanding of nervous system function in health and disease. We also exploit the unique structural and functional features of synapses to learn about general principles of cell biology. A major focus of our research is the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis and traffic of synaptic vesicles, the secretory organelles that store and secrete fast-acting neurotransmitters. Synaptic vesicles deliver their content into the synaptic space by fusing with the plasma membrane (exocytosis) and are rapidly re-formed by the recycling of their membranes via endocytosis. Studies of these organelles are thus relevant for the understanding of mechanisms involved in the secretory and endocytic pathways in all cells. <br><br>A major pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling is clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Generation of a clathrin-coated vesicle implies a precise and ordered sequence of events, such as clustering of protein cargo, acquisition of curvature and invagination, fission of the deeply invaginated bud, uncoating of the newly formed vesicles, and translocation away from endocytic sites. Although most of the players in these reactions have been identified, their mechanisms of action, in many cases, remain unclear. We use a variety of complementary approaches - including biochemistry, structural biology methods, cell-free systems, dynamic light microscopy imaging of live cells, super-resolution microscopy methods and mouse genetics - to understand these events and their regulation. We are also investigating the potential occurrence of clathrin independent pathways of synaptic vesicle reformation.<br><br><strong>The Fission Reaction of Endocytosis<br></strong>Fission\xe2\x80&#148;the physical separation of an endocytic bud from the plasma membrane\xe2\x80&#148;is the \xe2\x80\x9cdefining\xe2\x80\x9d event of endocytosis. Dynamin, an unconventional GTPase that oligomerizes into rings and spirals at the neck of endocytic buds, has long been known to be a critical player in this reaction, both at synapses, and in other systems. As we continue to investigate the precise mechanism of action of dynamin in fission, we investigate the function of other factors that cooperate with dynamin in this process.&nbsp; They include proteins with membrane-deforming properties (see below) and the actin-based cytoskeleton.<br><br>We are also gaining insight into dynamin\xe2\x80\x99s function from the knockout of the three mouse dynamin genes, all of which are expressed in the brain. This work has already yielded surprises and provided new insight into synaptic vesicle\xe2\x80&#147;recycling mechanisms. We found that dynamin 1, a neuron-specific protein and by far the major dynamin isoform in the brain, is not essential for synaptic vesicle recycling, but is needed to allow efficient synaptic vesicle reformation under condition of intense activity.&nbsp; Dynamin 2, the ubiquitous dynamin isoform, is essential for embryonic development but not for neuronal function, thus indicating that it does not have an essential house keeping role independent of the other dynamins. No obvious phenotypic defects are observed in dynamin 3 knockout mice. Work is in progress to address the functional consequence of ablating&nbsp; expression of all 3 dynamin&nbsp; genes in neurons or in selected non-neuronal cells. <br><br><strong>Properties and function of endosomes in nerve terminals</strong><br>The role of \xe2\x80\x9cendosomes\xe2\x80\x9d in synaptic vesicle recycling remains unclear. Strong and prolonged stimulation of synapses leads to synaptic vesicle depletion and to a transient accumulation of cisternae that only slowly convert to new synaptic vesicles.&nbsp; At least some of these structures appear to form by bulk endocytosis, a clathrin independent form of endocytosis. While the occurrence of these endocytic intermediates has been known for decades, their properties and the mechanism through which they generate synaptic vesicles are not known.&nbsp; Furthermore, their relation to endosomes that play housekeeping functions in all cells remains elusive.&nbsp; It is expected that the elucidation of the biochemical, structural and functional characterization of endosome-like structures of the presynapse will shed new light on vesicle recycling mechanisms.&nbsp; Ongoing work investigates the properties of these organelles at synapses of wild type and mutant mice.&nbsp; Such studies are complemented by investigations of endosomal traffic and its regulation in non-neuronal cells.&nbsp; Live cell imaging and electron tomography feature prominently in our tool-box for these projects.<br><br><strong>Endocytic Proteins, Bilayer Deformation, Curvature Sensing<br></strong>Research from our lab pioneered the concept that protein modules that bind and deform the bilayer play a role in the generation of membrane curvature at endocytic sites. Two such modules are BAR and F-BAR domains. Both BAR and F-BAR domains are present in many proteins that bind dynamin and/or regulate actin function and are therefore thought to cooperate with dynamin in fission. In collaboration with Vinzenz Unger (Yale University), we continue our structural studies of these proteins with emphasis on their structure in the membrane-bound state.&nbsp; We are also investigating the precise cellular function of selected members of these protein families, the endophilins in particular, in membrane fission and actin regulation.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Phosphoinositides and Membrane Traffic<br></strong>Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the 3, 4, and 5 position of the inositol ring results in seven phosphoinositides that play a major role in cell signaling. Because of their heterogeneous subcellular distributions and their ability to bind proteins at the membrane-cytosol interface, phosphoinositides are critical determinants of organelle identity and major regulators of vesicular transport. Following our identification of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin 1 as a protein neighbor of dynamin and clathrin, and then of a cycle of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis and hydrolysis nested within the synaptic vesicle exo-endocytic cycle, we have become more generally interested in the role of these phospholipids in orchestrating membrane traffic in neurons and other cells. We have expanded our work to investigate the role in exo-endocytic traffic of other phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes, and the function of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in progression of endocytic traffic.&nbsp; Such studies are closely interconnected with our studies of endosomes at synapses. Surprisingly, despite the importance of phosphoinositides in cell physiology and growing evidence for the role of abnormal function of some of these enzymes in human diseases, including neurological and psychiatric diseases, most phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes are still poorly characterized.&nbsp; The involvement of some of these enzymes in diseases of the nervous system is being investigated.<br><br>An important current focus of our lab is the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL, whose mutations are responsible for the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe and for Dent disease, two rare but severe human conditions involving kidney reabsorption defects and, in the case of Lowe syndrome, also mental retardation and congenital cataract. We have demonstrated a major site of action of this phosphatase at early stations of the endocytic pathway, including endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where its function may overlap with the function of synaptojanin in coupling endocytosis to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 dephosphorylation. We have also identified new interactors of OCRL, including the endocytic adaptor APPL1, and we are currently characterizing their physiological functions and their potential role in disease.&nbsp; We hope to elucidate the precise relationship between OCRL mutations and the clinical manifestations of the Lowe syndrome and Dent disease toward the goal of developing therapeutic strategies for these conditions.</p>'

S'<p>My lab is interested in the <span>study the pathway of sex determination in maize, a process that involves cell death and cell arrest. <em>Zea mays</em> is an ideal organism for molecular genetic studies on the sex determination process. Maize produces unisexual flowers, called florets in grasses, with pistillate (female) florets formed in the ear and staminate (male) florets formed in the tassel. Initially, these floral meristems are bisexual (cosexual). Through the action of sex determination (SD) genes they later become unisexual by the selective elimination of one sex and maturation of preformed organ primordia of the opposite sex. The formation of staminate florets in the tassel involves programmed death of pistil subepidermal cells and sexual maturation of stamen initials. Our mission is to understand these pathways in maize, including the associated processes of tasselseed-mediated pistil cell death, silkless-mediated pistil cell protection, and gibberellin (GA)-mediated stamen cell arrest.</span><br><br>We are also interested in unraveling the origin and early diversification of <em>Antp </em>superclass homeobox genes (including Hox genes and the related ParaHox and NK-like genes) in <em>Trichoplax adhaerens</em>.

Preclinical and clinical studies support the hypothesis that neuronal atrophy and cell loss in response to stress contribute to mood disorders.

S'<p>Dr. Egan\xe2\x80\x99s primary research interest is to understand the regulation of ion transport across the airway epithelia in health and disease. Transepithelial ion transport is responsible for maintaining the airway surface fluid, i.e. the periciliary fluid layer, which controls mucociliary clearance. Abnormalities in the ion channels and regulators of these channels can alter mucociliary clearance, leading to retained secretions, mucus plugging, infection, and lung destruction, as seen in cystic fibrosis. In CF, it is the abnormal function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a multifunctional protein encoded by the gene that is affected in cystic fibrosis (CF) that underlies the abnormal ion transport in affected organs. <br><br>The Egan lab uses a variety of electrophysiologic techniques to examine how CFTR expression affects transepithelial ion transport in airway epithelial cells. They have shown that CFTR can modulate other ion channels and, as its name implies, act as a conductance regulator. In addition, they have been very interested in understanding and identifying the mechanism(s) that underlie these interactions; and the lab has been examining proteins related to CFTR with the hopes of identify regions/domains that are common to these proteins and are necessary for these interactions. Lastly, the laboratory is interested in examining how mutations in CFTR affect its ability to function.</p><p>Bovine papillomavirus E5 protein<br><br>The laboratory is interested in determining the mechanism of action of viral oncogenes, with the belief that these studies will provide new insight into signal transduction and the control of cell proliferation.

S'<p>My laboratory is focused on the cellular and molecular events that are involved in the pathogenesis of injury and repair in the lung. &nbsp;We are particularly interested in the responses in human lung diseases and animal models of these diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury. &nbsp;Our studies have defined the cellular sources, regulation and effector profiles of many inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and remodeling cytokines in the lung including IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, leukemia Inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, IL-13 and gamma-interferon. &nbsp;These studies highlighted the cytokine networks that regulate their production, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that mediate these events, and their regulation by important respiratory states such as aeroallergen challenge, virus infection, innate immune activation and Th2 inflammation.

These findings demonstrated that receptor tyrosine kinases can be activated by proteins that do not resemble their normal ligands. We also showed that direct interactions involving specific transmembrane and juxtamembrane amino acids in the E5 protein and the PDGF \xc3\x9f receptor result in dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of the receptor, and recruitment of cellular signaling molecules into a signal transduction complex. Thus, the E5 protein acts as a specific, intramembrane crosslinker of the PDGF \xc3\x9f receptor. We are conducting genetic and biochemical experiments to define the structure of this unique complex, in the belief that it will provide new insight into the assembly of transmembrane protein complexes in general.

S'<p><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" --><p>Our lab studies the molecular basis of T cell differentiation. We haveused genomic approaches to identify genes selectively expressed in Tcell lineages and gene targeting, transgenic mice, and retroviraltechnology to elucidate the function of given genes and their targetsequences. Thus, we showed that the transcription factor GATA-3 isnecessary and sufficient for Th2 cytokine expression and identifiedepigenetic mechanisms through which it works. By the elimination ofseveral MAP kinases or kinase kinases, we elucidated the role of theseenzymes in T cell differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, the JNK pathwayis required for CD4 T cell differentiation, but not T cell activation. </p><p>The innate immune system contains genome-encoded receptors thatprovide a first line of defense to infection. Activation of innateimmunity triggers adaptive immunity. There are three classes of innateimmune receptors: <br><ul><li>Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which sense agents in theextracellular/vesicular space; </li><li>Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which sensemicroorganisms that penetrate the cytoplasmic space; and </li></ul><ul><li>RIG-likereceptors (RLRs), which recognize viral infection and trigger type 1interferon production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>We identified the TLRs for double-strand RNA(TLR3), single-stranded RNA (TLR7), flagellar protein (TLR5), andlipoprotein (TLR1/2).  Upon penetration of the cytoplasm, NLRs triggerNF?B activation, interleukin-1 (IL-1) production, or apoptosis. Inhumans, NLR mutation correlates with inflammatory disease. Nod2 carriesa leucine-rich repeat region probably recognizing bacterial muramyldipeptide, a nucleotide-binding domain mediating conformational change,thereby enabling oligomerization between CARD domains of Nod2 anddownstream receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase, causingactivation of NF?B and antimicrobial peptides. NOD2is mutated in Crohn\'s disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease(IBD). Our Nod2-deficient mice were more susceptible to infection withpathogens delivered to the gut, because of reduced production ofantimicrobial peptides. Thus, patients with CD may be unable to developan effective antimicrobial response, causing enhanced infection andsevere inflammation.  <br><br>The Nalp proteins comprise a second armof the NLR family. We study several of these, including Nalp3 (NLRP3),which senses infection or other stress that leads to K+efflux and activates the "inflammasome" through oligomerization withthe adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), enabling ASCto bind to and activate caspase-1 to process pro-IL-1\xc3\x9f and othersubstrates.   We found that multiple stimuli activate the Nalp3 inflammasome, including Listeriainfection. J\xc3\xbcrg Tschopp (University of Lausanne) showed that thisinflammasome recognizes uric acid crystals, explaining the inflammatoryproperties of uric acid in gout. We found that alum, a crystallineimmune adjuvant and the only USA-approved human adjuvant, activates theNALP3 inflammasome, which triggers macrophage inflammatory cytokineproduction and adaptive immunity in vivo.<br><br>Disruption of the pathwayeliminates alum\'s adjuvant capacity. Likewise, particulateenvironmental pollutants, including silica and asbestos, also activatethe Nalp3 inflammasome to cause devastating chronic inflammatorydisease. Thus, inflammasomes mediate anti-infective immunity,immunopathology to environmental pollutants, and adaptive immunity.  The immune response sometimes reacts toself-tissues, causing autoimmunity. How can antigenic stimulation of alymphocyte lead to such different outcomes? During an immune responseor in autoimmunity, the lymphocytes divide and differentiate intoeffector cells. However, when immune tolerance occurs, the cell iseither inactivated or dies. <br><br><em>How are the decisions made to proliferate,differentiate, be tolerized, or die, and how is this controlled?</em><br>Regulatory cells producing inhibitory cytokines are critical to preventautoimmunity. Of these, the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregis the most studied. The functioning, generation, and maintenance ofregulatory T cells (Treg) are controlled by cytokines. Bothtransforming growth factor-\xc3\x9f (TGF\xc3\x9f) and IL-10-family cytokines areimportant. Mice lacking TGF\xc3\x9f develop autoimmunity to several tissues.To elucidate upon which cells TGF\xc3\x9f acts, we expressed adominant-negative TGF\xc3\x9f receptor (dnTGF\xc3\x9fRII) on either T cells orantigen-presenting cells (APCs). Mice displaying the dnTGF\xc3\x9fRII on Tcells recapitulate the diseases of TGF\xc3\x9f-knockout mice: autoimmunity andIBD. In addition to autoimmunity, such animals have an enhancedanti-infective response, better resistance to infection. Finally, micecarrying the dnTGF\xc3\x9fRII on their T cells are resistant to tumors. Thus,tumors use TGF\xc3\x9f to inhibit the antitumor T cell response; but if TGF\xc3\x9fcannot act, immune clearance of tumors occurs.  To determine whether TGF\xc3\x9f controls innate immunity,we expressed dnTGF\xc3\x9fRII using the CD11c promoter, which expresses indendritic (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells, both key mediators ofinnate immunity. When innate immune cells cannot be inhibited by TGF\xc3\x9f,both NK and DC innate, as well as adaptive, immune responses areenhanced. CD11c dnTGF\xc3\x9fRII mice are also more susceptible toautoimmunity, because TGF\xc3\x9f fails to control APC function. Thus, TGF\xc3\x9fcontrols T cells, APCs, and NK cells.  We revealed additional mechanisms of TGF\xc3\x9f functionby studying conditional-knockout mice lacking TGF\xc3\x9fRII on T cells. TGF\xc3\x9fis required for Treg homeostasis and function and TGF\xc3\x9fRII must bepresent on a target cell for a Treg to be suppressed. We also foundthat TGF\xc3\x9f controls the magnitude of T helper 1 cell (Th1) response bysetting the level of CD122 \xc3\x9f chain of the IL-15 receptor, whichcontrols the pool size of Th1 cells. Many cells make TGF\xc3\x9f. To determinewhich TGF\xc3\x9f source is important, we first eliminated TGF\xc3\x9f on T cells,using conditional targeting. Mice with T cells that cannot make TGF\xc3\x9falso developed autoimmune disease and IBD, albeit slower than micelacking the receptor on all T cells. Thus, T cell\xe2\x80&#147;produced TGF\xc3\x9f isimportant in immune response, but other sources must play a role.Regulatory T cells that cannot produce TGF\xc3\x9f poorly control IBD, and Tcell\xe2\x80&#147;produced TGF\xc3\x9f is essential to generate Th17 cells, which mediatedisease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  T cells are activated and differentiate intospecialized effector cells. <br><br><em>How is the effector pathway triggered thatis appropriate to the class of infection?</em> We found the Th2 response isactivated when parasite antigen induces Notch ligand expression ondendritic cells. This activates Notch in na\xc3\xafve T cells, which in turninduces GATA3, the key Th2 transcription factor, by a Notch-responsivepromoter. Thus is a pathogenic signal converted to a signal for T celldifferentiation through Notch.   We identified cis-regulatory elements that are the targets of transcription factors, such as GATA3. In the interleukin-4 (IL-4) locus, the IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 genes are clustered, and several DNA elements within that region are important for gene expression. IL-4 gene regulation occurs through epigenetic mechanisms that target regulatory elements distal from the IL-4gene. One of these elements is a previously unrecognized locus controlregion (LCR) that is found embedded in the introns of the RAD50gene in the cluster. This LCR, together with these respective promotersand other cis elements of the locus, is in a preassembled complex inna\xc3\xafve T cells that serves as a hub from which epigenetic changes inhistone acetylation and DNA methylation occur and enables rapidresponse of the loci.   When na\xc3\xafve T cells are activated, both the IL-4 locus on chromosome 11 and the interferon-? (IFN-?)locus on chromosome 10 are expressed almost immediately, despite thefact that following differentiation these loci are never coexpressedbut instead are alternatively expressed in the Th2 and Th1 lineages,respectively. To investigate this rapid coexpression, we examined thephysical relationship between these two loci on the differentchromosomes. The LCR of the IL-4 locus on chromosome 11 and the IFN-?gene region on chromosome 10 are associated in the interphase nucleusof the precursor cells but separate upon differentiation into effectorcells. Mutation in the LCR on chromosome 11 delays expression of the IFN-?gene on chromosome 10. We find other such associations and furtherevidence for their functional roles. Thus, regulatory sequences on onechromosome likely control "in trans" gene expression on otherchromosomes.  Our laboratory retains a long-standing interest inthe underlying mechanisms of apoptosis. The program of cell death istriggered through the activation of cysteine proteases called caspases.Caspase-3 and -7 cleave similar substrates. Caspase-7\xe2\x80&#147;knockout micehave only a mild phenotype, but the combination with caspase-3deficiency results in embryonic lethality. Caspase-3 and -7 are alsorequired for upstream mitochondrial functions in apoptosis, via apositive-feedback loop, in addition to their roles as effectorcaspases.</p>'

Our work is directedtowards understanding the mechanisms by which ion transport take place,and our attention is focused on a particular family of transportproteins, the cation-chloride cotransporters. Among these, the Na-K-Clcotransporter uses the Na gradient to drive accumulation of cellular Kand Cl and is a central element in the process of net salt transport inboth secretory and absorptive epithelia.

It is hoped that these will allow usto address a number of overall statistical questions aboutmacromolecules, relating to their physical properties, cellularfunction, interactions, and phylogenetic distribution. We areespecially focused on the human genome and proteome. Our researchinvolves a number of quantitative techniques, including databasedesign, systematic datamining and machine learning, visualization ofhigh-dimensional data, and molecular simulation. More specifically, wefocus on three questions. First, we are interested in annotating theraw human genome sequence, especially in characterizing the vastintergenic regions and one of their most important elements,pseudogenes. Next, we are trying to get at the function of all theprotein elements encoded by the genome. Here, we try to characterizefunction on a large-scale through the use of molecular networks.Finally, for the population of proteins that have known 3D structures,we are trying to see how their function is carried out through motionand how motion can be predicted from packing geometry.</p><p><p>The biological sciences are being transformed by the advent oflarge-scale data.

S'<p>In our laboratory we use zebrafish as a model system to investigate therole of microRNAs during vertebrate development. We combine genetics,embryology, genomics, chemical and computational biology to address acentral question in biology: how does a fertilized egg develop into acomplex multicellular embryo. This process requires a precise spatialand temporal regulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs are ~22nt RNAmolecules that repress gene expression post-transcriptionaly. More than4% of the vertebrate genes encode microRNAs that are predicted toregulate more than 25% of the protein coding genes. Thus, microRNAsprovide novel regulatory layer of unknown function with potentialwidespread implications in development and disease. We have generatedzebrafish embryos mutant in the microRNA processing machinery (Dicer).Dicer mutants lack all microRNAs and fail to undergo normalgastrulation, brain and muscle morphogenesis.<br></p><p><p>The biological sciences are being transformed by the advent oflarge-scale data. The sequencing of the human genome is a most dramaticexample of this. Simultaneously, with this increase in biological data,computers and computation have had a transforming effect on the wayinformation is handled, stored, and mined. These computationaladvances, of course, apply to many facets of life. The goal of my labis to connect these two developments, harnessing computational advancesfor the analysis of large-scale data, principally by carrying outintegrative surveys, systematic data mining, and molecular simulation.</p>'

S'<p><strong>Gene targeting via triple helix formation.</strong> From an interest in studying cellular DNA repair and recombination pathways, we recognized the utility of DNA triple helix formation as a mechanism for the site-specific induction of recombination in human cells. We have recently demonstrated that triplex forming oligonucleotides can be used to mediate targeted modification of human disease-related genes. We are currently optimizing this approach for application in human hematopoietic stem cells and in mouse models of human genetic diseases. <br><br><strong>Tumor hypoxia, genetic instability, and cancer therapy.</strong> We discovered that tumor hypoxia is a key driver of genetic instability in human cancer cells. Mechanistically, we determined that this instability arises because of suppression of the DNA mismatch repair and homology dependent repair pathways, due to specific repression of the MLH1 and BRCA1, genes , respectively. This down-regulation of DNA repair in hypoxic cancer cells renders them vulnerable to therapeutic strategies that exploit the specific repair deficiencies, providing the basis for novel, rationally designed cancer therapies.</p><p><strong>Gene targeting via triple helix formation</strong><br>From an interest in studying cellular DNA repair and recombination pathways, we recognized the utility of DNA triple helix formation as a mechanism for the site-specific introduction of DNA damage in mammalian cells. Using psoralen-conjugated triplex-forming oligonucleotides, we initially demonstrated the feasibility of triplex-targeted mutagenesis in several model systems. We were able to determine conditions under which triplex oligonucleotides can enter cells and efficiently bind to and modify a target site within cells, leading to base pair specific mutations. Experiments with oligonucleotides not tethered to a reactive agent but capable of high affinity third strand binding revealed that triple helix formation can induce DNA repair and recombination in mammalian cells. This work has raised the possibility of using triplex formation as both a gene knock out and a gene correction modality. It has also suggested that unusual DNA structures may provoke repair activity and may contribute to genomic instability. We are currently studying the feasibility of targeting chromosomal genes using this approach, either by directly inducing mutations in the target gene or by stimulating recombination in a site-directed manner.<br><br><strong>Tumor hypoxia, genetic instability, and tumor progression</strong><br><span>We hypothesized that that acquired genetic instability in cancer cells may arise from the dysregulation of critical DNA repair pathways due to cell stresses within the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia. We initially confirmed this hypothesis by measuring mutation frequencies in experimental tumors using a lambda-based chromosomal shuttle vector reporter system. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon we used a microarray-based approach to screen for hypoxia-regulated DNA repair pathways. We found that hypoxia specifically down-regulates the expression of Mlh1 and Rad51, key mediators of DNA mismatch repair and of homologous recombination in mammalian cells, respectively. Down-regulation of Mlh1 and Rad51 expression by hypoxia was observed in numerous cell lines from a wide range of tissues, and was not correlated with cell cycle profile or hypoxia-inducible factor expression. Rad51 down-regulation was also detected&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;in the tumor microenvironment, as we observed consistent inverse correlations between hypoxia-marker staining and Rad51 expression by immunofluorescence in cervical and prostate cancer xenograft models. We propose the existence of a hypoxic phenotype in solid tumors, characterized by decreased expression of the critical DNA repair genes, Mlh1 and Rad51, representing a novel mechanism of acquired genetic instability in the tumor microenvironment and dysregulated DNA damage response in cancer cells.</span><br><br><strong>Mechanism of cancer cell killing by cisplatin</strong><br><span>Cisplatin is one of the most widely used cancer chemotherapy agents, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Current models suggest that cell killing by cisplatin occurs in a cell-autonomous manner via formation of platinum-DNA adducts that, if not removed by DNA repair, block transcription and replication. We have found that there is a separate cell-interdependent pathway of cisplatin killing in which damaged cells can transmit a death signal to neighboring cells. This signal is produced within the damaged cell by the kinase function of the Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PK complex and is conveyed to the recipient cell by direct cell-to-cell communication through gap junctions. Our findings suggest that DNA-PK activity and gap junction expression in human cancers may influence the clinical response to cisplatin. In addition, strategies to manipulate these cellular components in conjunction with cisplatin treatment may provide new approaches to cancer therapy.</span><br><br><strong>DNA repair and mutagenesis in transgenic mice</strong><br><span>We are carrying out mutagenesis studies using a lambda phage vector construct as a chromosomal shuttle vector in transgenic mice and mouse cells. We have determined that p53 overexpression can lessen mutagenesis by UV light, and we have examined the spectrum of x-ray-induced point mutations in mouse cells. In transgenic mice, we have found that locus specific effects can profoundly influence the mutation frequency in a reporter gene, and we have begun to study tissue-dependent variations in the pattern of spontaneous mutagenesis. Recently, we have created doubly transgenic mice carrying not only the lambda shuttle vector for reporting mutations but also a targeted disruption of the mouse PMS2 gene, a homolog of the E. coli mutL gene involved in mismatch repair. The human homolog of this gene has been associated with hereditary colon cancer. We are examining genetic instability in these mice using the lambda vector system. Preliminary work has shown elevated levels of mutation in all tissues tested, in contrast to the limited tissue distribution of cancer in the animals, a difference which highlights the complexity of cancer etiology.</span></p>'

S'<p>The role of innate immunity in transplantation. My initial research efforts were on the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs, key cellular mediators of innate immunity) in transplant rejection responses. My laboratory was the first to demonstrate that TLRs were critical for acute allograft rejection in a murine, minor mismatch skin transplant model (Journal of Clinical Investigation 111: 1571-1578, 2003). In this paper, we found that MyD88 (a critical TLR signal adaptor protein) was essential for dendritic cell (DC) maturation and priming of Th1 immune responses after transplantation. Given that infections are not known to drive transplant rejection in this model, this paper was one of the first to determine that TLR signaling via MyD88 is critical for a non-infectious inflammatory insult. We subsequently demonstrated an important role for TLRs in Th1 alloimmune responses in more immunogenic skin and cardiac murine experimental transplant models (American Journal of Transplantation 4: 1429-1439, 2004). This work was the basis for my first successful R01 application, which investigates the role of innate immunity in transplantation tolerance (R01AI064660). Furthermore, my laboratory has investigated the innate activators of DCs during acute allograft rejection and found that fragments of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronan, activated DCs to prime allogeneic T cells in a TLR-dependent manner (American Journal of Transplantation, 6: 2622-2635, 2006). In this paper, we also reported that human lung transplant patients who were diagnosed with chronic rejection manifested higher hyaluronan levels than those free of this disease. Finally, we examined the role of TLR signaling in neonates and whether altered TLR responses might explain the ease by which neonates can be induced to accept allografts. My laboratory reported that TLR activated murine neonatal B cells possess unique immunoregulatory properties that impair Th1 alloimmune responses (Journal of Immunology, 179: 1700-1710, 2007). Hence, I have been one of the first investigators to provide fundamental information regarding the role of innate immunity, specifically TLR signaling, in transplant responses. The practical implications of this work are that various groups are now considering transiently inhibiting TLR responses during the initial period after organ implantation.</p><p>The role of innate immunity in transplantation.My initial research efforts were on the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs, key cellular mediators of innate immunity) in transplant rejection responses.

With this funding, my laboratory then went on to demonstrate that MyD88 signaling impeded the induction of transplantation tolerance (Journal of Immunology 177: 5307-5316 2006). Furthermore, my laboratory has investigated the innate activators of DCs during acute allograft rejection and found that fragments of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronan, activated DCs to prime allogeneic T cells in a TLR-dependent manner (American Journal of Transplantation, 6: 2622-2635, 2006). In this paper, we also reported that human lung transplant patients who were diagnosed with chronic rejection manifested higher hyaluronan levels than those free of this disease. This work was funded in part by a faculty development grant from the American Society of Transplantation. Finally, we examined the role of TLR signaling in neonates and whether altered TLR responses might explain the ease by which neonates can be induced to accept allografts. My laboratory reported that TLR activated murine neonatal B cells possess unique immunoregulatory properties that impair Th1 alloimmune responses (Journal of Immunology, 179: 1700-1710, 2007). This work was supported by the Roche Organ Transplant Research Foundation. Hence, I have been one of the first investigators to provide fundamental information regarding the role of innate immunity, specifically TLR signaling, in transplant responses. The practical implications of this work are that various groups are now considering transiently inhibiting TLR responses during the initial period after organ implantation.Aging and immune functionDuring the last four years, I have developed a new line of investigation: the role of aging in immune responses. My interest was initially fueled by the question of whether impaired innate immune responses with aging explain the reduced ability of older transplant recipients to reject allografts. However, I quickly became interested in broader medical issues, specifically how aging impairs host defense to viral infections and how to boost defective immune responses with aging. After initially receiving pilot funds from the Hartford Foundation and Pepper Center, I successfully competed for the prestigious Beeson Award, which I received in 2005. This proposal examines T cell biology during viral infection with aging and allowed my laboratory to develop expertise in viral infectious models and in vitro cell culture techniques. My laboratory subsequently demonstrated that myeloid DCs, the most potent antigen presenting cells (APCs), manifested preserved TLR immune responses with aging and that defective priming of CD8+ T cells with aging during viral infection was intrinsic to the T cell (Aging Cell, 5: 473-486, 2006). This work led to the successful acquisition of a second R01 in 2007 (R01AG028082) to further investigate how aging modifies innate DC responses and adaptive T cell responses during viral infections. Importantly, this award investigates whether TLR-based vaccines can restore defective immune responses in aged hosts.</p>'

What host orenvironmental factors play dominant roles in this selective process?&nbsp; These questions are timely because a role forthe gut microbiota is an emergent theme in our understanding of many metabolicdisorders and infectious diseases.<br><br>To this end, <strong>we developed agenerally applicable, new experimental approach (insertion sequencing, orINSeq) for functional genome-wide analysis</strong> of organisms for which a genomesequence (and potentially little else) is known. This approach is based on modification of the broadhost-range, randomly integrating transposable element mariner to capture short fragments of adjacent genomic DNA.Massively parallel sequencing of these captured genomic fragments from tens ofthousands of mariner insertionstrains of a given bacterial species produces a high-resolution map of theprecise location and relative abundance of each transposon in the population.Selection changes the representation of transposon mutants, thereby allowingidentification of genes and pathways that are key to fitness under theconditions being examined. We first applied this system to the prominent humangut symbiont <em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em>, <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> in wildtype and genetically manipulated gnotobiotic mice,in the presence or absence of defined communities of other human gutsymbionts. <strong>The results clearly indicatedthat symbiont survival in the gut is in no way a \xe2\x80\x98passive\xe2\x80\x99 affair</strong>; instead, weidentified hundreds of genes that are absolutely required for fitness in vivo. These genes (i) include, butextend far beyond, those required for maximal growth in vitro; (ii) are not a random sampling of the genome, but insteadare enriched in specific functional categories; and (iii) often display acommunity context-dependent impact on fitness, such that they are required by <em>B. thetaiotaomicron</em> as a member of somedefined microbial communities but not others. These studies also highlighted anunexpected aspect of selection and competition in this system\xe2\x80&#148;the <strong>vitamin B<sub>12</sub>and its analogs (corrinoids)</strong>, studied for over 50 years for their role in humanhealth, may be key mediators of microbial community structure in the mammaliangut. Future studies are focused on understanding corrinoid exchange in the gutand applying INSeq to other prominent human gut symbionts.<br><br>For many microbial communities,the great majority of organisms have not been cultured in the laboratory. We\xe2\x80\x99redeveloping <strong>high-throughput approaches for assembling large human gut culturecollections</strong> from single healthy or diseased individuals, with the goal ofre-uniting discrete components of these communities in germfree mice. Thesepersonalized culture collections provide a new platform for studying resourcesharing and competition in the gut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>'

S'<p><span>We study mechanisms mediating the complex pathfinding and synaptogenesis of axons and dendrites during early development and how those mechanisms may degrade during aging. In the olfactory system, ~1,000 subpopulations of sensory neurons express different odor receptors. The sensory neuron axons segregate in the olfactory bulb based on odor receptor expression, producing a highly specific molecular map. Understanding the molecular basis of this segregation of axons is one of our primary goals. <br>In parallel, we study the targeting and differentiation of dendrites to understand the mechanisms that regulate their highly specific interactions with small subsets of the sensory neuron axons. Unique to the olfactory system, ongoing adult neurogenesis generates new populations of sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium and interneurons centrally. The molecular differentiation and integration of these adult generated neurons into synaptic circuits is an ongoing interest in the lab.</span></p><p><h3>Current Research Program</h3><p>A major goal of my laboratory is understanding the basic mechanisms that contribute to the establishment of orderly topographic maps within the CNS, during both normal development and during regenerative events following injury or disease. We have been focusing our efforts on the olfactory system, in part because of the complexity of the map between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Axons sort into 1,000 functional subsets that are targeted with high specificity to olfactory bulb glomeruli.<br>&nbsp;<br>Using both in vivo and in vitro models, we are currently isolating several mechanisms that may contribute to this complex reorganization including laminin, tenascin and the expression of putative odor receptors in growth cones. In related studies we continue to characterize a unique population of glial cells, ensheathing cells, found in the olfactory nerve. While elsewhere in the mature CNS glia are an impediment to axon growth, the ensheathing cell glia support axon extension and targeting throughout life. <br><br>We recently demonstrated that the growth promoting effects of ensheathing cells are not limited to olfactory receptor neurons but are also seen in other populations of neurons. Particularly exciting, our recent studies demonstrate that the ensheathing cells remain pluri-potential and that when implanted into demyelinated spinal cord can adopt a myelinating phenotype which remyelinates the axons and contributes to a restoration of normal conduction velocities.</p>'

S'<p>Our primary research interest is in finding and characterizing genes that cause reading disability, commonly known as dyslexia. Reading disability is present in 10 to 20% of school children and is the most common cause of learning disability. It is also mostly genetic in origin with genetic factors accounting for 40 to 60% of the poor performance in reading tests. Through genetic studies of families and children with reading disability we identified a major contributor, called doublecortin-domain- containing-2 (DCDC2) We found that a deletion in&nbsp;a putative regulatory sequence in DCDC2 is present in ~20% of dyslexics. We have found 14 variations (alleles) of this regulatory (enhancer) sequence&nbsp;and are identifying which alleles are the most deleterious, which may be protective, and how these variations functionally alter brain development. &nbsp;We are also assessing dyslexia using various imaging modalities in children - including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state connectivity \xe2\x80&#147; as an endophenotype for conditioning our genetic studies (\xe2\x80\x9cimaging-genetics\xe2\x80\x9d). &nbsp;Our preliminary data suggest that imaging is a sensitive phenotype for dyslexia and will identify new functional-genetic units for reading not previously appreciated.<br></p><p><br></p>'

S'<p><p>We wish to understand at a molecular level how specific eukaryoticproteins are selected for rapid degradation even while most proteinsare spared. Such turnover occurs primarily through theubiquitin-proteasome system and is central to a variety of cellregulatory mechanisms, many of medical relevance. The proteasome is amolecular machine that fragments proteins into short peptides. Moregenerally, we study the reversible enzymatic coupling of proteins toother proteins within cells.

S'<p>We are focused on the relationship between the biophysical properties of proteins and the molecular mechanisms of human disease. NMR spectroscopy is a central tool in our research program, which we use to determine the tertiary structures of proteins and to monitor aspects of their molecular behavior under physiologic conditions. <br><br>We have sought to identify biomedically-important proteins whose regulation by dynamic structural transitions and conformational equilibria is altered in disease. Using NMR spectroscopy and other techniques, our general approach is to structurally define the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dynamic behavior and to quantitatively relate the kinetics of associated conformational equilibria to specific cellular or biochemical functions. <br><br>We have explored a variety of proteins, including multiple cytokines and receptors, a polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzyme, a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, and protein domains involved in vesicle transport. Details of these and other projects are available on our laboratory web site.</p><p>Our primary scientific interest is to better understand how the structural and biophysical properties of proteins contribute to their role in pathophysiology of human disease. NMR spectroscopy is a central tool in our research program used to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins in solution and to monitor a variety of biophysical properties under physiological conditions. At the moment, we are investigating a number of biomedically important protein systems, which are briefly summarized below. A detailed description of some of our ongoing research efforts can be found below.<br><br><strong><span>Molecular basis for pH-dependent regulation of protein hormone function.</span></strong><span> The overall goal of this project is to define the biophysical basis for the pH dependence of humanprolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)-receptor recognition and tocharacterize its functional importance during intracellular trafficking ofendocytosed hormone-receptor complexes. Secreted protein hormones and cytokinesexperience multiple regulated variations in solution acidity, or pH, duringtheir functional lifecycles. Briefly, after synthesis and transport into theendoplasmic reticulum, secreted proteins are initially exposed to a near neutralpH, which is later acidified to around 6.0 in the trans-Golgi and to 5.0 in thedense cores of secretory granules. Once released into extracellular fluid, thepH varies from 6.5 \xe2\x80&#147; 7.8; but, after recognition and activation of cell surfacereceptors, endocytosed ligand-receptor complexes experience a step-wiselowering of acidity first to pH ~ 6.5 in mature endosomes, to pH ~ 5.5 in lateendosomes, and, if not directed back to the cell surface for recycling, to alysosomal pH &lt; 5. Given recent evidence for continued receptor signalingfrom the endosomal compartment and for the complex intertwining of the signaltransduction and endocytic machineries, the overall activity of proteinhormones must depend on their response to these regulated changes in localized pH.In a sense, protonation of ionizable groups in proteins is analogous to theinteraction of other cations, such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> thatallosterically regulate protein function. In particular, the imidazoleside-chain of histidine residues is ideally suited to serve as the primarysensor of variations in acidity across the pH range 5.5 \xe2\x80&#147; 7.5. <br><br>We have chosento focus on the protein hormones, hPRL and hGH, and their respective cellsurface receptors (hPRLr and hGHr) due to our previous experience investigatingthis protein familyand our discovery of a nearly one thousand-fold loss of binding affinity ofhPRL for its receptor over the narrow range of pH from 7.5 to 6.0; whereas, the affinity of hGHbinding to the same receptor remains essentially constant. We hypothesizethat this difference in pH dependence depends entirely on structural changes inthe intermolecular interfaces of these two hormone receptor complexes. Wewill also test the hypothesis that acid-induced dissociation of endocytosedhormone-receptor complexes (or lack thereof) regulates intracellular traffickingtowards either lysosomal degradation or recycling back to the cell surface.</span> Our approach relies on a combination of measurement of site-specific protonation reactions using both NMR spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry, modeling of the thermodynamic linkage between receptor-binding and protonation, high resolution structural analysis of hormone-receptor complexes, and complementary cellular studies. Projects are currently available combining any of the above methodolgies.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Molecular Mechanism for Hematopoietic Cytokine Receptor Activation and Transduction of Cell Signaling. </span>The long-term goal of this project is to delineate the specific structural and functional interactions involved in hematopoietic cytokine receptor activation and signal transduction. However, given our previous experience with the hPRL and hGH receptor subfamily, current efforts are exclusively focused on these two cytokines. Although best known for its traditional role as a pituitary-derived hormone, recent research has established important autocrine/paracrine functions of prolactin (PRL) in the growth and development of a diversity of tissues. PRL and its receptor are expressed in cancers of the breast, prostate and female reproductive tract. PRL has mitogenic and angiogenic function in these tumors and increases cancer cell motility. Whereas a vast majority of pituitary-derived PRL is secreted as the full-length, unmodified protein, in peripheral tissue glycosylated and phosphorylated variants of PRL are found. Research has demonstrated functional consequences of these modifications, some of which may act to counter the tumorigenic effects of unmodified PRL. <br><br>Recently, we have successfully expressed, purified and refolded the extracellular domain of the hPRL receptor extracellular domain (ECD), along with its separate fibronectin-like III) subdomains (S1 and S2). The isolated S1 and S2 domains can be prepared in milligram quantities and are both highly soluble and stable in aqueous buffer, allowing the application of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques to the analysis of their structural properties. We hypothesize that the hPRL receptor homodimerizes in at least two alternate conformational states, associated with the active and inactive states of the receptor. <strong><em>Projects are immediately available in the laboratory involving the structural and biophysical characterization of these receptor ECDs.</em></strong><br><br><strong>Polymorphic Drug Metabolizing Enzymes. </strong>Research over the past 30 years has demonstrated striking genetic variability in the enzymatic pathways used to metabolize xenobiotics (drugs, poisons, pollutants, etc.) in the human body. This metabolic diversity complicates the administration of pharmaceutical agents to combat disease, resulting in variable levels of efficacy and toxicity from the same dosage of medications applied across a population. Ideally, the selection and dosing of individual medications would be specifically tailored to a predicted response within an individual. The scientific study of this genetic diversity and its relation to the administration of pharmaceuticals is the focus of the developing field of pharmacogenetics. <br><br>One common biological mechanism for generating diversity in metabolic pathways involves inherited polymorphisms in the protein sequence of enzymes, which appear to target the polymorphic proteins for intracellular degradation. We would like to understand the structural and biophysical mechanisms by which genetic polymorphisms within the protein sequences of these enzymes modulate their relative role in drug metabolism and, consequently, on the variable efficacy and toxicity of administered pharmaceuticals. Our work so far has concentrated on the enzyme, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes the class of 6-thiopurine medications, including 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine and azathioprine. Large variations of TPMT activity exist in humans and a variety of genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT protein sequence have been identified that target the allelic variants for proteasomal degradation. <br><br>We have determined the three-dimensional structure of TPMT using NMR spectroscopy and characterized the consequences of ligand-binding on the conformation and molecular dynamics of the polypeptide backbone. We are currently analyzing the consequences of the polymorphic mutations on the structural and functional properties of TPMT in order to characterize the molecular basis for increased susceptibility to intracellular degradation.<br><br><span><strong>The GLUT4-tethering protein, TUG.&nbsp;</strong>This project focuses on the interactions between the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, found in muscle and adipose cells and a recently discovered protein, TUG, that regulates GLUT4 trafficking. Discovered by our collaborator, Dr. Jonathan Bogan, TUG binds directly to GLUT4-containing vesicles and tethers them intracellularly. In response to insulin, TUG releases GLUT4 allowing translocation to the plasma membrane. Like many other proteins, TUG is composed of a modular array of independent protein domains. Our long term goal is to determine the tertiary structures of these TUG domains, to structurally characterize their interactions with each other and with a number of associated proteins, and ultimately to develop a detailed molecular model for TUG-regulated GLUT4 trafficking. A combination of sequence analysis and experimental studies has identified a number of ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains in TUG. We have chosen these UBL domains as the initial focus of our structural studies because of (1) their demonstrated functional importance in TUG-mediated GLUT4 tethering and release, (2) the clear delineation of their structural domain boundaries based on sequence alignment, and (3) a pre-existing knowledge base of their potential interactions partners based on the conserved functions of homologous UBL domains in other proteins. The results of these studies will benefit diabetes research both by contributing to a better understanding of the cellular mechanism for insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking, and also by structurally characterizing novel targets for the rational design of pharmaceutical agents with the potential to modulate cellular glucose uptake.</span></p>'

S'<p>The Holley lab studies patterning and morphogenesis during vertebrate segmentation.  We seek to understand the mechanism of the somite clock, which creates rapid  oscillations in gene expression within the field of cells about to undergo  segmentation. These oscillations manifest as stripes of gene expression that  repeatedly travel as waves through this field of cells. The clock governs  morphological segmentation in which mesenchymal cells form epithelial segments  that ultimately give rise to the skeletal muscle and vertebral column of  the adult vertebrate. The Holley lab is using molecular, genetic, embryological,  and 4D imaging techniques to study the somite clock and somite morphogenesis.

We are using both C.elegans and miceexpressing mutant G85R SOD1, a version of SOD1 unable to reach the native state, studying the transgenic animals with genetic, morphologic, and biochemical approaches, toinvestigate how the mutant SOD1 selectively produces motor neuron dysfunction. <br><br>Mouse studies.<br>We have identified that there is a progression of misbehavior of mutant SOD1 protein itself in the spinal cord of transgenic animals.&nbsp; Initially it is soluble and associated to a significant extent with the abundant cytosolic chaperone Hsc70 (by contrast the wild-type protein does not form such association, presumably because it occupies the native state).&nbsp; Subsequently the mutant SOD1 protein begins to form both soluble oligomers (observable by gel filtration chromatography) and insoluble aggregates and at this point an additional molecular chaperone, Hsp110 becomes associated with the soluble form.&nbsp; At this point the animal exhibits mild lower extremity symptoms (weakness or pulling in when held by the tail) which progress over the next two to three months to lethal paralysis, usually commencing in the lower extremities.&nbsp; We are currently seeking to understand ultrastructural correlates of this progression using EM, analyzing motor neuron cell bodies in the spinal cord, sciatic nerve axons, and neuromuscular junctions.&nbsp; Where do abnormalities first present?&nbsp; What is the progression?&nbsp; Can we identify biochemical correlates using immunohistochemistry or laser capture microdissection of motor neurons coupled with genomics (RNA-seq e.g.) or proteomics?&nbsp; At another level, what are the electrophysiologic correlates?&nbsp; Finally, can we modify disease by crossing in various mutant genes?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>Cellular models. <br>We have produced mouse embryo fibroblast lines from our transgenic mice and are studying macromolecular processes in them, inspecting for mutant-specific behavior.&nbsp; We have also produced ES cell lines from the animals and are beginning to differentiate motor neurons from them, with a view to having a supply of motor neurons with which to carry out additional phenotypic studies.&nbsp; In short, can the ALS phenotype or some portion of it be recapitulated in culture?&nbsp; <br><br>Overall, we are hoping that between worm, cell culture, and mammalian systems we will be able to deduce the mechanism of SOD1-linked ALS and potentially design preventive steps.&nbsp; Understandings of SOD1-linked disease may extend more generally to other forms of ALS, or possibly to other neurodegenerative diseases. &nbsp;</p>'

S'<p>We are interested in understanding how the structure of glutamate receptors determines their kinetic behavior. A combination of patch-clamp recording of macroscopic and single-channel currents and X-ray crystallography is employed to elucidate the major conformational changes that translate neurotransmitter binding into ion channel opening and receptor desensitization. Experimental and simulation studies are designed to determine the role of receptor kinetics in shaping synaptic transmission in the brain.</p><p>Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS and exerts many of its diverse effects through oligomeric receptors that are ligand-gated channels. Multiple families of glutamate-receptor (GluR) subunits exist, and each family contains several subunit genes.During the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, most of our work focused on native channels. Using cerebellar granule cells as a convenient model system, we explored the expression and properties of GluRs in developing and mature neurons and investigated how the subunit composition of GluRs determines the functional properties of this important class of neuronal receptors. These studies revealed that developmental changes in kainate-type GluR subunit expression and processing are associated with changes in unitary channel properties (Smith et al., 1999). Other studies showed that granule cells begin to express multiple subtypes of AMPA-type GluR channels shortly before synaptogenesis and that some, but not all, of these subtypes are segregated to synapses in mature neurons (Ripellino et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000). Both AMPA and kainate receptors in neurons in situ display multiple conductance levels. For AMPA receptors, the prevalence of sojourns in the different substates depends on the number of ligand molecules bound to the receptor (Smith and Howe, 2000). We also showed that alterations in the asynchrony of transmitter release and changes in receptor properties speed the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic currents at mossy fiber-granule cell synapses as these synapses mature (Wall et al., 2002).Most of our recent work has focused on the kinetic behavior of recombinant glutamate receptors. A good deal about the structure of these receptors has emerged during the last several years, particularly for the ligand-binding domain, and we are trying to understand how major conformational changes impact receptor function. We provided the first functional evidence that AMPA receptors are dimers of dimers (Robert et al., 2001) and proposed new kinetic models that account for the structural data and differ significantly from previous kinetic schemes (Robert and Howe, 2003, Robert et al., 2005). We resolved a controversy regarding the effect of lurcher, a spontaneously arising mutation in a highly conserved motif in one of the transmembrane segments of AMPA receptors (Klein and Howe, 2004), and contributed to work showing that NMDA receptor kinetics influence the coincidence detection that underlies LTP (Popescu et al., 2004). We also demonstrated that an auxiliary protein, stargazin, has effects on the kinetics of single-channel currents that account for its slowing of the decay of excitatory postsynaptic currents (Tomita et al., 2005). In collaboration with Elias Lolis, we recently initiated crystallographic studies of the isolated GluR2 ligand-binding core.</p>'

We study the regulation of cell migration and apoptotic cellengulfment in the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em> tounderstand cytoskeletal regulation. Because the cell lineage of the worm isinvariant, every cell migration and engulfment event throughout the organism'slife is known, which allows us to analyze at a single-cell level how specificmolecular changes affect these processes. We identified ABL-1, the homolog ofthe Abl tyrosine kinase, as an inhibitor of cell migration and apoptotic cell engulfment. We furthershowed that ABL-1 does so through the cytoskeletal regulator ABI-1, a proteinnot previously shown to regulate these processes.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to its role in cytoskeletal regulation,Abl functions in apoptosis, transcription and the responses to oxidative stress. Dysregulation of Abl via fusion to the BCR gene causesChronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and an aggressive subtype of AcuteLymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Emerging data implicate Abl signaling in several solid tumors also but how Abl signaling is involved is unknown. Our laboratory aims tocharacterize the role of Abl signaling in normalcell function and disease.&nbsp;<br><br>Using genetic, cell biological and proteomicapproaches we are asking a number of related questions: How is ABL-1 regulated?What are the ABL-1 phosphorylation targets and which ones regulate engulfmentand migration? What are other inhibitors of engulfment pathways? In what otherprocesses does ABL-1 function? Are these roles conservedacross species? How are the various functions of ABL-1 integrated to accomplishspecific goals during an organism\xe2\x80\x99s development? &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project 1. Assess thefunctions of <em>C. elegans</em> homologs ofmammalian Abl and Abi interactors</strong>We are using a candidate approach to identifyproteins that act in ABL-1-dependent pathways based on reports of Abl andAbi-interacting proteins from the scientific literature in mammals. The vast majority ofthe over 100 proteins reported to interact with Abl and Abi have homologs in <em>C. elegans</em>. While functions have been ascribed to some of these interactions,the significance of many of them is unclear. We have already demonstrated thatsome of these homologs have effects on apoptotic cell engulfment and are nowanalyzing how they function in this process.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project 2: PhosphoproteomicAnalysis of <em>abl-1</em></strong><strong>mutants</strong>Using mass spectroscopy, the laboratory of MatthiasMann has recently published a technique to determine the <em>in vivo C. elegans</em> phosphoproteome, i.e. the entire set ofphosphorylated peptides in adult <em>C.elegans</em>. Because <em>abl-1</em> is expressed broadly throughout embryogenesis, my laboratory,in collaboration with Dr. Mann\xe2\x80\x99s group, will determine the phosphoproteomes ofwild-type and <em>abl-1 C. elegans</em> embryos.&nbsp; This will be the firstanalysis of the effect of deletion of a tyrosine kinase on the phosphoproteomeof an entire organism. Notably, this technique will not only assess the effecton tyrosine phosphorylation, but also on the phosphorylation of serines andthreonines so secondary effects of Abl function on other signaling pathwayswill also be evaluated by this technique.

Thus, thisscreen should have identified genes that act in parallel to <em>abl-1 </em>in pathways vital for the animal\xe2\x80\x99ssurvival. 108 such genes were identified, most of which are conserved inmammals. Among the 108 genes are many that appear promising for future study,including genes or homologs of genes involved in cytoskeletal regulation, cellmigration, cellular signaling and transcription. In addition there are genesthat are conserved but without known functions. Such genes are particularlypromising candidates for finding novel biological roles for ABL-1. All of these will be analyzed for Abl-related functions.<br><br><strong>Project 4.

Harnessing the potential of species diversity makes biologicalsystems ideal to solve defining challenges, such as producing new drugs toalleviate human disease and generating biologically derived fuels, chemicalsand materials to ensure environmental sustainability.&nbsp; In addition to a thorough understanding of biologicalsystems, achieving these goals requires safe and programmable control ofbiological systems.&nbsp; In thisregard, scientists have been primarily using standard recombinant DNAtechnologies, which have enabled our ability to perform genetics, but on alimited scale.&nbsp; Our ability tomeasure and modify genetic and biochemical molecules and their interactions inpathways, cells and the environment remains a defining challenge.&nbsp; Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cbasic enabling technologies\xe2\x80\x9dthat enhance our ability to engineer biology are needed.&nbsp;<br><br>TheIsaacs Laboratory is focused on developing foundational cellular andbiomolecular engineering technologies to understand and engineer biologicalsystems.&nbsp; Our approach is designedto integrate engineering and evolution through the construction of genes, genenetworks and whole genomes alongside quantitative models to gain a betterunderstanding of whole biological systems.&nbsp; In turn, we utilize these insights to design and evolveliving cells with new, improved and desired function.&nbsp; We seek to uncover new properties of biological systems andgenerate new phenotypes with the ultimate goal of applying these insights toaddress global challenges in medicine, energy supply and the environment.</span></p><p><span><strong>Abl Kinase Regulation of the Cytoskeleton</strong><br><br>Cytoskeletal changes are vital both for normalprocesses such as physiologic cell migration, engulfment (e.g. phagocytosis)and tissue morphogenesis and for pathologic ones such as cancer cell invasionand metastasis. We study the regulation of cell migration and apoptotic cellengulfment in the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em> tounderstand cytoskeletal regulation. Because the cell lineage of the worm isinvariant, every cell migration and engulfment event throughout the organism'slife is known, which allows us to analyze at a single-cell level how specificmolecular changes affect these processes. We identified ABL-1, the homolog ofthe Abl tyrosine kinase, as an inhibitor of cell migration and apoptotic cell engulfment. We furthershowed that ABL-1 does so through the cytoskeletal regulator ABI-1, a proteinnot previously shown to regulate these processes.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to its role in cytoskeletal regulation,Abl functions in apoptosis, transcription and the responses to oxidative stress. Dysregulation of Abl via fusion to the BCR gene causesChronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and an aggressive subtype of AcuteLymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Emerging data implicate Abl signaling in several solid tumors also but how Abl signaling is involved is unknown. Our laboratory aims tocharacterize the role of Abl signaling in normalcell function and disease.&nbsp;<br><br>Using genetic, cell biological and proteomicapproaches we are asking a number of related questions: How is ABL-1 regulated?What are the ABL-1 phosphorylation targets and which ones regulate engulfmentand migration? What are other inhibitors of engulfment pathways? In what otherprocesses does ABL-1 function? Are these roles conservedacross species? How are the various functions of ABL-1 integrated to accomplishspecific goals during an organism\xe2\x80\x99s development? &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project 1. Assess thefunctions of <em>C. elegans</em> homologs ofmammalian Abl and Abi interactors</strong>We are using a candidate approach to identifyproteins that act in ABL-1-dependent pathways based on reports of Abl andAbi-interacting proteins from the scientific literature in mammals. The vast majority ofthe over 100 proteins reported to interact with Abl and Abi have homologs in <em>C. elegans</em>. While functions have been ascribed to some of these interactions,the significance of many of them is unclear. We have already demonstrated thatsome of these homologs have effects on apoptotic cell engulfment and are nowanalyzing how they function in this process.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project 2: PhosphoproteomicAnalysis of <em>abl-1</em></strong><strong>mutants</strong>Using mass spectroscopy, the laboratory of MatthiasMann has recently published a technique to determine the <em>in vivo C. elegans</em> phosphoproteome, i.e. the entire set ofphosphorylated peptides in adult <em>C.elegans</em>. Because <em>abl-1</em> is expressed broadly throughout embryogenesis, my laboratory,in collaboration with Dr. Mann\xe2\x80\x99s group, will determine the phosphoproteomes ofwild-type and <em>abl-1 C. elegans</em> embryos.&nbsp; This will be the firstanalysis of the effect of deletion of a tyrosine kinase on the phosphoproteomeof an entire organism. Notably, this technique will not only assess the effecton tyrosine phosphorylation, but also on the phosphorylation of serines andthreonines so secondary effects of Abl function on other signaling pathwayswill also be evaluated by this technique. We will analyzethe differentially phosphorylated proteins for their roles in the processes in which ABL-1functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project 3. Identify andcharacterize essential roles for ABL-1</strong>It is likely that ABL-1 has functions in <em>C. elegans</em> in processes other than thosedescribed above. Loss of <em>abl-1</em> is notlethal to <em>C. elegans</em>, probablybecause there are other proteins that act in parallel to ABL-1 for many of itsroles. To identify such proteins and the processes in which they act, wescreened a <em>C. elegans </em>RNAi libraryfor synthetic lethality with <em>abl-1</em>.RNAi clones that specifically killed <em>abl-1</em>mutant animals but not wild-type animals might have reduced the activity ofproteins required for viability in the absence of ABL-1 function. Thus, thisscreen should have identified genes that act in parallel to <em>abl-1 </em>in pathways vital for the animal\xe2\x80\x99ssurvival. 108 such genes were identified, most of which are conserved inmammals. Among the 108 genes are many that appear promising for future study,including genes or homologs of genes involved in cytoskeletal regulation, cellmigration, cellular signaling and transcription. In addition there are genesthat are conserved but without known functions. Such genes are particularlypromising candidates for finding novel biological roles for ABL-1. All of these will be analyzed for Abl-related functions.<br><br><strong>Project 4. Use a mammaliancell culture assay to test conservation of <em>C.elegans</em> ABL-1 findings</strong>To test whether Abl functions in mammalianengulfment, we are using a cell culture-based mammalian engulfment assay.Because all known <em>C. elegans</em>engulfment genes and <em>abl-1</em> are conservedin mammals, RNAi against or overexpression of each of the mammalian homologs ofengulfment genes&nbsp; and <em>abl-1</em> can be used to test the effects onengulfment. In addition, we will test any new conserved genes identified by theother screens.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Project 5. Expressionanalysis of <em>abl-1 </em>mutants</strong>In combination with the phosphoproteomic analysis,an expression analysis will be performed to compare <em>abl-1</em> mutants to wild-type animals using RNA-seq, a method toquantitate expression levels of all transcripts in the animal by deepsequencing of cDNAs transcribed from the animals\xe2\x80\x99 RNA. By comparing the twoexpression patterns, we hope to gain a global view of the effect of ABL-1 onthe transcriptome. Combining these data with the phosphoproteomic analysis, acomprehensive overview of the effect of ABL-1 on two major and ofteninterrelated processes, phosphorylation and transcription, can be constructed. &nbsp;<br><br>Our lab aims to analyze globally what ABL-1, thehomolog of an important disease-related kinase, does in an organism <em>in vivo</em>. This type of approach mightallow us to begin to understand how the various functions of a kinase areintegrated within an organism to accomplish general developmental goals.Furthermore, these experiments should provide useful information aboutprocesses in which ABL-1 is known toact and could lead to the discovery of new functions for ABL-1. In addition,because there are a large number of well-defined tissue-specific and temporallyregulated promoters in <em>C. elegans</em>,later studies can be used to define where and when certain ABL-1 interactorsact, which could lead to better understanding of signaling networks. </span></p>"

S"<p>The mucosal surfaces represent major sites of entry for numerous infectious agents. Consequently, the vast mucosal surfaces are intricately lined with cells and lymphoid organs specialized in providing protective antibody and cellular immunity. One of the most fundamental issues in this field concerns how antigens in the mucosa are taken up, processed, and presented by antigen presenting cells. Our laboratory's goal is to understand how immunity is initiated and maintained at the mucosal surfaces, particularly by the dendritic cells (DCs), through natural portals of entry for pathogens that are of significant health concerns in the world. <br><br>We focus on understanding how viruses are recognized (innate immunity) and how that information is used to generate protective adaptive immunity. We study immune responses to herpes simplex viruses in the genital tract and influenza infection in the lung. Our recent focus also includes the study of how autophagy mediates innate and adaptive immune responses to these and other viral pathogens.&nbsp; Our ultimate goal is to utilize the knowledge we gain through these areas of research in the rational design of effective vaccines or microbicides for the prevention of transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Our research addresses mechanisms of innate recognition ofviruses and initiation of antiviral immunity, particularly at the natural siteof virus encounter at the mucosal surfaces. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Innate virus recognition and autophagy</strong><span>:The innate immune system has evolved to recognize invadingpathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).

S'<p>Some of the features of neuronal synaptic transmission that can be modified over the short and long term include changes in presynaptic calcium levels, changes in vesicle numbers and probability of release, and alterations in postsynaptic receptor numbers and function. Such variations account in part for the synaptic plasticity that may underlie learning and memory. Alterations in levels of activity at the synapse require increased energy, and therefore mitochondria could influence synaptic events by regulating the production or release of ATP, or by buffering and re-releasing calcium during vesicle fusion and recycling. BCL-2 family proteins, by their actions at mitochondrial membranes, normally play an important role in cell death at the soma, but can also strengthen or weaken synaptic connections. <br><br>Thus the actions of mitochondria at synaptic sites position these organelles to influence physiological and pathological changes in the brain. In neurodegenerative diseases, proteins that control mitochondrial ion channel activity may be key in deciding whether a synapse will live or die, and eventually, after the loss of many synaptic connections, whether a neuron will survive or undergo untimely death.</p><p>Our research addresses mechanisms of innate recognition ofviruses and initiation of antiviral immunity, particularly at the natural siteof virus encounter at the mucosal surfaces. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Innate virus recognition and autophagy</strong><span>:The innate immune system has evolved to recognize invadingpathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).

S'<p>In my laboratory we are interested in how humans and animals sensetouch and pain. These fundamental sensations originate in peripheralsensory neurons which contain signaling pathways that translateenvironmental stimuli into neural activity. Our aims are to identifythe molecular components of these pathways and to understand howsensory neurons become sensitized during injury and chronic painfulconditions such as inflammation.In our current studies we use pharmacological, molecular genetic andphysiological approaches as well as fluorescent imaging techniques toinvestigate the properties of ion channel proteins that serve assensors for temperature and noxious stimuli in sensory neurons. Theseproteins belong to the gene family of TRP (transient receptorpotential) ion channels, some of which are the targets of natural plantproducts that activate the sensation of heat and pain (capsaicin,mustard oil) or cold (menthol). We are using these compounds aschemical probes to study how TRP channels are activated, how theyinteract with endogenous ligands and how temperature sensing occurs.Another goal in our lab is to understand how signaling pathways areused to increase TRP channel activity in disease. TRP channels areregulated by other receptor systems through membrane phospholipidturnover, kinase pathways and endogenous ligands. Increased channelactivity results in neural sensitization that causes hypersensitivityto sensory input and contributes to painful inflammation by a mechanismknown as neurogenic inflammation. This mechanism is important forconditions such as arthritis, vasculitis, psoriasis, intra- andpostoperative pain, trauma, invading cancer and visceral andmusculoskeletal disorders. With our studies we hope to gain newmechanistic insights into neurogenic inflammation, identify potentialpharmacological targets and reveal basic molecular and cellularmechanisms of sensory transduction.</p><p>Our research addresses mechanisms of innate recognition ofviruses and initiation of antiviral immunity, particularly at the natural siteof virus encounter at the mucosal surfaces. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Innate virus recognition and autophagy</strong><span>:The innate immune system has evolved to recognize invadingpathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).

S'<p>The research focuses on the application of computational methods to solve  problems concerning structure and reactivity for biomolecular systems. This  includes development and application of procedures for accurate calculation  of protein-ligand binding affinities. Three approaches are taken that include  explicit representation of the protein-ligand complexes using molecular mechanics  (MM): a scoring function approach with the BOMB program, and extended linear  response and free energy perturbation calculations using Monte Carlo sampling  with explicit solvent. Recent examples addressed the binding of drug candidates to HIV-1 RT, factor Xa, COX-2, FAAH, and kinases. BOMB is also usedfor de novo drug design through the creation and screening of large combinatoriallibraries. Modeling of reactions in gas phase, in solution and in enzymes isalso studied. The aim is elucidation of reaction mechanisms and the origin ofmedium effects on rates. A QM/MM approach is taken, and the reacting systemsare described with the improved semiempirical MO method PDDG/PM3 that we havedeveloped. The enzymes and solvent are represented using MM, and the samplingis performed with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics.

Our laboratory has cloned the genes formultiple new potassium and calcium channels that are influenced by theactivity of either serine/threonine or tyrosine protein kinases.

S'<p>Our lab studies an important immune cell coreceptor called CD8 and host-pathogen interaction with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, an obligate intracellular bacteria. The human and chimpanzee CD8B gene has acquired new exons that lead to isoforms with different cytoplasmic tails. We are determining functional relevance with potential applications to immunotherapy. For the Chlamydia project we are examining the mechanisms by which host cells respond when infected.</p><p>Gene Regulation: We created transgenic animals with pieces of human DNA from the human CD8 gene complex (alpha and beta genes) and were able to obtain correct developmental expression of the genes. To localize regulatory elements, we performed sequence analysis, DNase I hypersensitivity mapping, and MAR (matrix attachment region) analysis. We identified several striking regions and are performing further transgenic and knockout studies to firmly establish the presence of regulatory elements. Structure/Funtion Analysis: The CD8 protein interacts with ligands on the outside of the cell (i.e. MHC class I) and with molecules on the inside of the T cell (i.e. tyrosine kinase p56lck, LAT). It also functions as a coreceptor with the T cell receptor forming a complex with MHC class I. Our goal is to understand in molecular terms how the different protein interactions occur and if there are differences between homo (a/a) vs. heterodimeric (a/b) forms of CD8. Taking advantage of crystallographic information, we perform mutational analysis and create models of how the proteins interact. Immune Response to Chlamydia Trachomatis (Ct): Ct is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) worldwide and of ocular trachoma in developing countries. We are characterizing T cell responses to the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of Ct, a good vaccine candidate. Using special reagents called tetramers, we were able to detect MOMP-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of infected individuals at frequencies that are significant (0.01-0.20% of CD8+ T cells). We plan to continue to characterize these cells with regard to homing receptors and function and will determine their role in immunity to Ct.</p>'

S"<p>The control of glucose homeostasis is a multi-component process where hormonal, sensory, and nutritional inputs and outputs cooperate to ensure proper energy balance. Diabetes mellitus results from dysfunctional integration of this regulatory network and is frequently associated with increased insulin resistance or inadequate insulin secretion. Mitochondria are central to both of these. Mitochondria, therefore, require mechanisms to 'sense' their own metabolic environment in order to respond to supply and demand. My lab has identified one such signal, mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP), as an important 'fuel-sensor' involved in glucose homeostasis. Every turn of the TCA cycle generates stoichiometric amounts of mtGTP, and as such mtGTP synthesis acts as a 'molecular tachometer' of mitochondrial metabolic flux. In tissues such as pancreatic cells and hepatocytes, the mtGTP is hydrolyzed by mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M) to generate PEP.

S'<p>The human genome is predominantly composed of non-protein coding sequences (&gt;98%) whose function remains largely undefined. A significant portion of the non-coding DNA is believed to serve as transcriptional regulatory elements that control how and when the coding fraction of the genome is used by a cell. Precise expression of each gene during development is achieved by a coordinated action of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements. In order to reconstruct and understand genome expression, we systematically identify these elements and determine how they are connected and controlled. We also investigate how aberrant use of and alterations of these elements can cause cancers.

One current project focuses how signaling by the neurotransmitterGABA is regulated to reduce neural activity enough to prevent seizures but notso much as to prevent any activity. Another project seeks to uncover the basicmechanisms of signaling by the neurotransmitter serotonin, defects in which arethought to underlie depression in humans.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The research in ourcomputational biology and bionformatics laboratory involves analysis ofgenomics and proteomics experiments. This includes computational analysis ofoutput from high-throughput datasets generated from experiments involvingmelanoma, breast cancer, hematopoeisis, cell cycle genomics, andprotein-protein interactions. The central focus of our earlier studies was toreveal functional and regulatory gene modules using genome-wide data generatedin various "Omics" experiments and auxiliary information fromgenomics databases. &nbsp;We addressed issues of normalization and artifacts inmicroarrays. Subsequently, we developed a novel spectral method forbi-directional clustering of cancer microarray data to reveal regulatory genemodules. The lab has also focused on extracting meaningful biologicalinformation from experimental systems by assessing the co-expression of genesregulated by various transcription factors, evaluating pathway expression andbuilding genetic networks based on functionality rather than pureexpression.&nbsp; This approach is a step forward in identifying genes inregulatory networks that are disrupted by mutations of tumor suppressors andoncogenes and could shed light on the process of malignanttransformation.&nbsp; Our research also involves the integration of sequenceinformation with genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome profiles. Thisanalysis has allowed us and our collaborators to reveal non-unique sequencerecognition motifs of transcription factors in an in vivo context and topredict combinatorial regulation partners of transcription factors. Moreover,this approach has allowed us to find spatial organization of transcriptionfactor binding events, as well as their relationships with other epigenomic factors.<br><br>&nbsp;The current computationalactivities in our laboratory include the following areas: a) Application ofsignal processing approaches for identification of relevant biological signalsin high-throughput experiments, such as identification of aberrations inmulti-subclonal cancer samples, signal denoising in next generationplatforms,&nbsp;and de-mixing of cell types in heterogeneous samples, b)developing approaches to analyze high dimensional data from genomics platformsfor biomarker discovery and personalized medicine. In particular, we useadvanced applied mathematical methods to search complex local and non-localgenomic patterns across the genome that may discriminate cancer patients withgood vs. poor outcomes in CNA studies employing next generation sequencing orSNP platforms and c) uncovering direct and collective regulatory relationshipsbetween regulators (TFs, epigenomic factors and miRNAs) and their target genesby integration of heterogeneous Omics datasets and DNA sequences.<br><br>&nbsp;From a biologicalstandpoint we are particularly interested in:a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of primary or drug-treated metastaticsubclones with proliferation and invasion potential in heterogeneous cancerbiopsiesb)&nbsp;&nbsp;The interplay between regulatory motifs, chromatinstatus and multi scale chromosomal structurec)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining whether complex traits associated withcertain common diseases vary across populations with different geneticbackgrounds</span></p>'

S'<p>The overall goals of my research are to characterize bone marrow (BM) derived  stem/progenitor cells, and to define the mechanisms that regulate the self-renewal  and differentiation of these cells with the hopes that the findings can be  translated to improved therapeutics. We have 2 major foci, and we welcome  graduate students to join the lab. The first is based on our discovery that  BM cells can differentiate into mature epithelial cells of the lung, liver,  GI tract and skin. Projects are ongoing on the functional effects of BM transplantation  and to determine the cells and mechanisms responsible for this engraftment.  The second focus is the molecular mechanism(s) regulating gene expression  during normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We are using hematopoietic stem  cells and human embryonic stem cells to better understand Acute Megakaryoblastic  Leukemia. <em>In vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> cell and molecular approaches  will help us to better understand hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.</p><p>Hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis using bone marrow derived stem and progenitor cells Projects in the lab focus on molecular mechanisms that regulate early hematopoiesis and may be dysfunctional in leukemogenesis. Specifically, we are using primary cells as well as murine and human embryonic stem cells to study RBM15 and MKL1, two genes that are fused in the t(1;22) translocation associated with Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia AMKL). We are studying the roles of RBM15 and MKL1 in normal myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis. &nbsp; We have shown that RBM15 is downregulated as hematopoietic stem cells differentiate down the myeloid lineage such that megakaryoblasts express low levels of RBM15. When RBM15 is overexpressed, it prevents myeloid differentiation, and when RBM15 is inhibited or deleted, myeloid differentiation is enhanced, and there is a loss of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell self-renewal. RBM15 is a member of the spen family of proteins that share a C-terminal SPOC domain that bind to the nuclear corepressor complex. Consistent with other members of the SPOC domain family that can affect Notch signaling, we have shown that RBM15 represses Notch induced Hes1 promoter activity. RBM15 coimmunoprecipitates with RBPJk, a critical transcription factor in the Notch signaling pathway. Thus, RBM15 plays a role in hematopoiesis by maintaining myeloid cells in an undifferentiated state, and this activity is mediated by inhibition of Notch signaling. <br><br>MKL1, identified at the C-terminus of the t(1;22) translocation specific to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, is highly expressed in differentiated muscle cells and promotes muscle differentiation by activating serum response factor (SRF). The Krause laboratory has shown that MKL1 expression is upregulated during murine and human megakaryocytic differentiation, and that enforced overexpression of MKL1 enhances megakaryocytic differentiation. When the Human Erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line is induced to differentiate with TPA, overexpression of MKL1 results in an increased number of megakaryocytes with a concurrent increase in ploidy. MKL1 overexpression also promotes thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of primary human CD34+ cells. The effect of MKL1 is abrogated when SRF is knocked down, suggesting that MKL1 acts through SRF. Consistent with these findings in human cells, knock out of MKL1 in mice leads to reduced platelet counts, and reduced ploidy in bone marrow megakaryocytes. Thus, MKL1 promotes physiological maturation of human and murine megakaryocytes. &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;Differentiation of marrow-derived cells into epithelial cells The focus on plasticity is based on a very exciting discovery in the Krause laboratory that bone marrow derived cells are capable of differentiating into non-hematopoietic cells throughout the body. In 2001, we published our finding that a single bone marrow derived cell could engraft the hematopoietic system and differentiate into mature epithelial cells in mice, and in 2002, we published that the same occurs in humans. Since that time, we have focused on several important questions regarding this plasticity including which cell populations in the bone marrow are responsible for this plasticity, and how these cells are regulated. We have shown that bone marrow transplantation leads to amelioration of renal mesangial sclerosis, and we have shown that bone marrow derived cells can engraft as functional epithelial cells in the GI tract and airways of mice with cystic fibrosis. In studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which BM cells become epithelial cells, we have discovered that this involves at least 2 different mechanisms, one involving cell fusion and the other not. We hypothesize that hematopoietic cells can only take on the gene expression pattern of epithelial cells via cell fusion, but that other nonhematopoietic cells in the BM (and perhaps elsewhere), can differentiate into epithelial cells without cell fusion.</p>'

S'<p>My laboratory is involved in developing novel RNA interference (RNAi)-based strategies for treating viral infections. RNAi is a gene silencing mechanism in which 19-21 nucleotide double-stranded RNAs called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can guide the destruction of complementary cellular mRNAs with a high degree of specificity. A major challenge in using RNAi-based therapies in vivo is the targeted delivery of siRNAs to specific tissues/cells of interest. Targeted delivery would not only improve efficacy but also reduce potential side effects of RNAi therapy. <br><br>Towards this goal we have recently developed a novel method for the specific delivery of siRNAs into human T cells and tested in vivo efficacy using \xe2\x80\x9chumanized mice\xe2\x80\x9d: (immunodeficient mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells and consequently a human immune system).

Interestingly, children with FA are born with congenital anomalies and develop aplastic anemia and an assortment of leukemias and other cancers. Based on our interest on marrow failure and genomic instability, we have also started working on 3 related projects. First, we have begun to purify the protein complexes containing gene products that are defective in 2 additional hematopoietic failure syndromes, Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA). As in FA, the proteins (RPS19 for DBA, codanin for CDA) have no known function, and additional genes accounting for additional genetic complementation groups remain to be cloned and identified.Second, we are investigating ways to use our knowledge of genomic instability for improving cancer therapeutics. Finally, we have also started a more clinical project, using mass spectroscopy technology we have used to find FA binding proteins. Again in collaboration with the Semmes laboratory, we have adapted the mass spec to analyze sera from patients with pediatric malignancies in order to identify unique protein markers of disease. These markers could then be used for diagnosis, prognosis, staging, and tracking of minimum residual disease in patients. In addition, our goal is to identify interesting proteins for further analysis in our laboratory.</P></p><p><span style="font-family: \'times new roman\'; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; ">Research in biomedical informatics/computational biology.

S'<p>We study how the frontal cortex and basal ganglia work together to control behavior. A topic of special interest is the role of persistent firing by frontal cortical neurons in executive control (anticipation, working memory, inhibitory control). Reaction time tasks have been most prominent in our work over the past several years. More recently, we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed tasks for studying decision-making, reversal learning, and delayed alternation (spatial and temporal). <br><br>Our principal methodology is neuronal ensemble recording. In addition, we use reversible inactivation methods (e.g., fluorescent muscimol), local injections of drugs, and anatomical tract-tracing methods to study brain function from a systems perspective. We also use statistical classifiers and other multivariate statistical methods to study neural coding at the single neuron and neuronal populations levels.</p><p>The goal of the Laubach Laboratory is to understand the role of the frontal cortex and basal ganglia in value-based decision making, food-seeking behavior, and the cognitive control of action. We wish to understand how frontal regions of the brain learn predictive relationships between stimuli and outcomes (such as food) and control action selection. <br><br>We are carrying out three lines of research related to these topics. First, we are studying how errors influence neuronal activity to improve future task performance. Second, we are studying how the values of external stimuli are learned and flexibly tracked under changing environmental circumstances and how these aspects of stimuli and actions are mapped onto neuronal activity. Third, we are studying how working memory, based on persistent firing by neurons in the frontal cortex, is used to link together sequences of goal-directed actions. <br><br>To study these issues, we use multi-electrode recording methods in awake, behaving rodents, methods for reversible inactivating brain regions (e.g., fluorescent muscimol), and tract-tracing methods. We are also active in developing methods for quantifying how neuronal spike trains and population activity represent information about behavior and how spike trains relate to fluctuations in local field potentials.

S'<p>The common human diseases that account for the vast majority ofmorbidity and mortality in human populations are known to haveunderlying inherited components. Advances in human genetics have madethe identification of genetic variants contributing to these traitsfeasible. Such identification promises to revolutionize the diagnosticand therapeutic approaches to these disorders. We have focused oncardiovascular and renal disease. To date, we have identified mutationsunderlying more than 20 human diseases; these include a host ofdiseases that define molecular determinants of hypertension, stroke andheart attack. We have gone on from these starting points to usebiochemistry and animal models to define the physiologic mechanismslinking genotype and phenotype. These findings have provided newinsight into normal and disease biology, are identifying new pathwaysunderlying disease pathogenesis, and are identifying new targets fordevelopment of novel therapeutics.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death world-wide.Epidemiologic studies have identified hypertension, high cholesterol,diabetes and smoking as major risk factors. By investigation of rarefamilies recruited from around the world that segregate single geneswith large effect, we have identified genes that contribute to thesetraits, putting a molecular face on their pathogenesis. For example, wehave identified mutations in 8 genes that cause high blood pressure(hypertension) and another 8 that cause low blood pressure. Thesemutations all converge on a final common pathway, the regulation of netsalt reabsorption in the kidney. These findings have established thekey role of variation in renal salt handling in blood pressurevariation, and have led to changes in the approach to treatment of thisdisease in the general population. They have also identified newtherapeutic targets that are predicted to have greater efficacy withreduced side effects. Finally, they have identified new signalingpathways involved in the regulation of blood pressure homeostasis. Wehave taken similar approaches to another common disease, osteoporosis,with the identification of gain of function mutations in LRP5, acomponent of the Wnt signaling pathway, in development of high bonedensity. This finding has led to intensive efforts to identify smallmolecules that impact this pathway to protect against and/or reverseosteoporosis in the general population. Ongoing studies use bothemerging and novel approaches to identification of genes thatcontribute to disease burden in the population, and to understandingthe pathways that link genes to disease.Mutations that affect blood pressure in humans. A diagram of anephron, the filtering unit of the kidney, is shown.

S'<p>We study molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewing division ofstem cells. Currently, we focus on small RNA-mediated epigeneticprogramming and translational regulation that are required for theself-renewal of germline and embryonic stem cells. Meanwhile, we areexploring the clinical implications of our findings. Stem cells arecharacterized by their abilities to self-renew and to produce numerousdifferentiated daughter cells. These two special properties enable stemcells to play a central role in generating and maintaining most tissuesin higher organisms. Over-proliferation of stem cells can cause cancer,whereas under-proliferation of stem cells leads to tissue dystrophy,anemia, immuno-deficiency, or infertility. Drosophila and the mouserepresent two powerful systems for studying stem cells since they alloweasy access to combined genetic, cell biological, and molecularanalyses. We use Drosophila as a pilot model to explore molecularmechanisms underlying stem cell division, and the mouse as an advancedmodel to expand what we learn from Drosophila to mammalian and humansystems. Previously, we identified germline stem cells in theDrosophila ovary and revealed their self-renewing asymmetric division.We and others showed that the asymmetric division of these stem cellsis controlled by both niche signaling and intracellular mechanisms.Using systematic genetic screens, we have identified key genes involvedin both niche signaling and intracellular regulation of stem celldivision. Among them, piwi/argonaute genes represent the only knownfamily of genes required for stem cell self-renewal in both animal andplant kingdoms. Currently, our research is focused on epigeneticprogramming and translational regulation of germline stem cellself-renewal mediated by the Piwi/Argonaute proteins and a novel classof non-coding small RNAs called piwi-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that weand others recently discovered.

We have contributed to the development of a system for growing infectious HCV in cell-culture starting from cloned cDNA, allowing us to fully dissect this pathogen at the level of genetics and biochemistry. We find that HCV infectivity correlates with virions exhibiting a low buoyant density, suggesting that infectivity depends on interaction with low-density serum components. <br><br>To understand further the molecular composition of infectious HCV particles, we are scaling up and purifying virions for proteomic and imaging analysis. These observations also suggest unique properties at the interface between HCV and its hepatocyte host. We therefore study the processes of HCV entry, RNA replication, and virion assembly at the level of cell biology. To aid in this analysis we are developing viruses with useful chemical and fluorescent tags. Other positive-strand RNA viruses of experimental interest include yellow fever virus, a relative of dengue and West Nile virus in the same family as HCV, as well as Flock House virus, a small insect virus that can replicate in yeast.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death world-wide.Epidemiologic studies have identified hypertension, high cholesterol,diabetes and smoking as major risk factors.

Tumors arise through the emergence of clonal cell sub-populations that have selective advantage in a disturbed or damaged tissue environment. The underlying genomic instability of tumors can lead to the continuous re-emergence of new cell sub-populations harboring different genetic or epigenetic alterations. There is evidence that among the cell sub-populations present in tumors, a key component is a group of cells with stem cell properties, and a greater metastatic potential. With the availability of microarray tools for detecting mutations, aneuploidy, DNA methylation changes, as well as RNA expression profiles, one could in principle identify sorted tumor cell sub-populations, including cancer stem cells, by their detailed genetic, epigenetic, and expression signatures.

Our studies aremultidisciplinary and include structural biology (X-ray crystallographyor NMR), high throughput screening and/or inhibitor design,structure-activity relationships, mutational analysis, yeast genetics,and animal models of disease.<br><br>Our current studies includestructure-function relationships of chemokines, a family of secretedproteins that recruit immune cells to the site of infection or tissueinjury and function by activating specific G-protein coupled receptors.CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) and vMIP-II is an agonist and antagonist,respectively, for CXCR4, a co-receptor for HIV-1. This receptormediates metastasis in a number of cancers, and a C-terminal mutationcauses an immunosuppressive disease known as WHIM syndrome.Importantly, CXCR4 is the target for Plerixafor, a drug used inperipheral stem cell transplantation. We have determined the structuresof CXCL12 and vMIP-II and are working towards understanding theirinteractions CXCR4 at high resolution. We are also using randommutagenesis combined with yeast genetics to define smaller peptideswith agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist activity.<br><br>The othermajor project is MIF. Inhibition of this "cytokine" MIF by neutralizingantibodies leads to therapeutic efficacy in animal models of sepsis,arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. This protein also inhibits theapoptotic activity of p53. The three-dimensional structure of MIFrevealed a striking similarity with two microbial enzymes, including anenzyme-like crevice with catalytic functional groups. We are nowattempting to determine the role of this site in inflammatory diseasesand cancer. Interestingly, parasites also express and secrete thisprotein. In collaborative studies with Drs. Michael Cappello andRichard Bucala, we have determined the structure of MIF expressed fromhookworm and Leishmania major, used high throughput screening, andstructure-activity relationships to identify compounds with nanomolarKi\'s that are lethal to hookworms.<br><br>Other projects includedetermining the structure of (1) signal transduction proteins involvedin inflammation, and (2) enzymes that degrade chemotherapeutic agents.</p>'

Our goal is to elucidate the nature of the infectious agent, and to delineate how the host responds to infection. <br><br>Many pre-senile dementias of unknown etiology, such as Alzheimer\'s Disease, may share common host-activated neurodegenerative pathways. We established the first rodent models of human CJD in the 1970s. An infectious agent that has many viral characteristics causes this progressive neurodegenerative disease. As many "neurotropic" viruses, the TSE agent can spread though the blood (1,2) to infect lymphoreticular tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes before invading the brain. At this stage, the infection is clinically inapparent or latent. <br><br>Nevertheless, the host recognizes the agent as foreign (unlike its own prion protein), and activates many innate immune responses before clinical signs of disease develop (3,4). None of these host responses are sufficient to stop the progressive infection, and effective treatment will probably require a rigorous molecular definition of the infectious particle. Infectious particles isolated from the brain are spherical show with a discrete viral size of 25nm in diameter corresponding to a molecular weight of ~5x10e3 kDa by high pressure liquid chromatography. They also have a homogeneous viral density (1.28gm/cc) in sucrose, a good indication that they contain a protected viral genome (reviewed in 5). Although agent-specific nucleic acid sequences have not been defined, nucleic acids more than 500nt long have been extracted from infectious 25nm particle-rich fractions. Recently, we identified arrays of similarly dense 25nm viruslike particles in situ within infected but not control cells in culture (6). Arrays of these particles are shown in the Electron micrograph at the right, where the bar is 100nm and several dense particles cut in cross-section are marked by arrows. Neither the isolated 25nm particles from brain fractions, nor those visualized in intact cells contain abnormal prion protein (PrP) as determined by antibody binding studies. In contrast, PrP antibodies did label abnormal PrP amyloid fibers as expected. This PrP amyloid was physically separated from the viruslike arrays in the cell. It is commonly assumed that PrP amyloid is the infectious agent. However, there is no reproducible evidence that this protein can infect animals and humans. Indeed, many studies show infectious particles are separate from PrP multimers and aggregates in accord with our initial gradient purifications. We think it most likely that host PrP is a required receptor for TSE viruses, and that viral-PrP membrane interactions ultimately cause a pathological PrP response. Ongoing experiments are designed to test this viral hypothesis. <br><br>On a public health level, a more virulent TSE agent has recently evolved in cows ("mad cow disease"), and has spread to humans and a variety of other species. There is also a spreading epidemic from yet another strain of TSE in the deer (cervid) population of the USA. It is not known if this TSE agent in cervids will infect humans. One of the most intriguing questions in the TSE field is what limits the natural spread and pathological sequelae of individual TSE agent strains. TSE strains maintain their identity despite various changes in prion protein (7). This fact strongly implicates a relatively stable but mutable viral genome. The figure below shows how dramatically TSE agents can differ in their capacity to evoke pathological sequelae. Section A below shows the brain lesions after infection with a typical attenuated sporadic CJD strain (sCJD) from humans. This agent provokes pathology and abnormal prion protein (red at arrow) only in a very small region of the thalamus and terminal disease only after &gt;350 days when passaged in mice. In contrast, section B shows the widespread deposits as in the hippocampus (H) caused by a more virulent geographic CJD agent isolated from a patient in Japan. This strain has not been found in the USA or Europe, and causes death in as little as 120 days in a mouse. Remarkably, the less virulent sCJD strain can interfere with superinfection by the more virulent Japanese CJD agent. This viruslike protection against a related challenge strain can last for the lifetime of a mouse. <br><br>Furthermore since no pathological PrP can be detected, abnormal PrP is not involved in this viruslike protection (8). Similar protection, without PrP involvement, has also been documented here in a simplified cell culture system (9). Cultures offer new opportunities to resolve fundamental questions as well as to rapidly assess preventive and treatment strategies. These may also lead to the development of effective preventive vaccines.</p>'

Understanding these mechanisms can lead to a better understanding of both disease and how the immune system works. My lab exploits human and non-human oncogenic herpesviruses to help uncover new approaches to improve human health.</p><p>Through co-evolution with their hosts, viruses have acquired exquisite mechanisms for coping with the anti-viral immune responses. Our lab is interested in detailing these viral coping mechanisms and examining their importance to pathogenicity, with the eventual goal of developing better prophylactic and treatment strategies. The major pathogens that we study are the gamma-herpesviruses, which include the most recently described human viral pathogen, Kaposi\xe2\x80\x99s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is the causal agent of one of the most common AIDS-associated cancers in the Western world, as well as being a leading cause of cancer deaths in many regions of Africa. We are in the process of characterizing several gene products of KSHV that are able to modulate and block the host immune response. Amoung these proteins are K3 and K5, able to down regulate multiple key immunomodulatory proteins from the surface of expressing cells, including MHC class I, B7.2, ICAM-1 and CD31. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of action of these proteins have not only provided potential targets for anti-viral therapies, but have also provided insights into the mechanisms of cellular endocytosis, trafficking and host control of the immune response. Another facet of our research is the characterization of the host immune responses being made against the virus. To aid us in these studies, we are taking advantage of several animal models utilizing closely related ?-herpesviruses including murid ?-herpesvirus (MHV-68) of rodents, Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) of New World non-human primates and rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) of Old World non-human primates. In vitro gene expression and characterization experiments combined with in vivo infection experiments are allowing us to better describe the relationship between the virus and the host. These experiments have the promise of not only leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral entry and tropism, but also to an understanding of what host responses are important to controlling viral infection, crucial in the design of anti-viral immunization strategies.</p>'

Both viruses establish \xe2\x80\x9clatent states\xe2\x80\x9d in host cells, during which only a limited number of viral genes are expressed. We have discovered multifunctional virally encoded transcription factors and replication proteins, ZEBRA and Rta in EBV and KSHV ORF50, which mediate a switch between latency and the lytic cycle. Our lab studies the control of ZEBRA, Rta and ORF50 expression and their mechanisms of action and interaction. We are interested in the basis of viral specificity of these activators. We also investigate how the immune system detects and regulates the latent and lytic cycle program of EBV in B cells.</p>'

Excessive/chronic inflammatory responses (e.g., TNF) and increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent common pathogenic mechanism for atherosclerosis. The vascular cell that primarily limits the inflammatory and atherosclerotic process is the vascular endothelial cells (EC). Inflammation/ROS induces EC dysfunction by disturbing normal homeostasis, relaxation and survival. These defects in EC function are mediated by cytokine/redox-regulated signal transduction and gene transcription. The primary goal in my laboratory is to dissect signal pathways during inflammatory responses and develop therapeutic targets for treatment of vascular diseases. We have focused on the following areas of inflammation: 1. To dissect TNF signaling pathways in EC. 2. To understand how shear stress inhibits TNF signaling to function as an atheroprotective factor. 3. To define the role of inflammation/oxidative stress in vascular diseases including atherosclerosis, graft arteriosclerosis, insulin resistance, and cardiomyopathy/heart failure. 4. To determine the mechanism of inflammation/ischemia-induced angiogenesis/arteriogenesis and vascular remodeling. In the first two areas, we have focused on apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1), a member of MAP3Ks mediating stress-activated kinase (JNK/p38) cascades. We have elucidated the mechanisms for ASK1 activation by various stresses (TNF, ROS and DNA damaging agents). Moreover, ASK1 is a target of laminar flow. While TNF/ROS activates ASK1, atheroprotective laminar flow inhibits ASK1 and ASK1-induced EC activation and apoptosis. We are now identifying signal transducers mediating the function of shear stress. We have recent identified new protein AIP1, a new member of Ras-GAP family protein, is a potential candidate. In the third area, we have shown that inflammation-induced mitochondria dysfunction (ROS generation) and intracellular kinase cascades play critical roles in causing EC dysfunction characterized by reduction of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, insulin sensitivity and EC survival. However, cellular anti-oxidant thioredoxin proteins (particularly the mitochondrial form) are critical regulators of inflammation/oxidative stress in EC. In the fourth area, we have demonstrated that antiangiogenic gene therapy inhibits progression of angiogenesis-dependent diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis in animal models. We have further identified TNFR2-Bmx-VEGFR2-mediated angiogenic pathway plays a critical role in inflammation/ischemic-induced angiogenesis/arteriogenesis and tumor metastases.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 20px; color: #323232; ">The primary goal in my laboratory is to dissect signal pathways during inflammatory responses and develop therapeutic targets for treatment of vascular diseases.

S'<p><p>The "central dogma" is a phrase coined in 1958 by Francis Crick to describe the universal observation that DNA codes for RNA which codes for proteins. Implicit in this description is the tenet that a linear chain of amino acids represents a complete code for a molecular structure. The study of protein folding is predicated on two observations. First, the functional structure of a protein resides at the free energy minimum of all possible conformations. Second, that despite an astronomical number of possible configurations, proteins successfully and independently adopt the functional one in a finite amount of time.<br>That normally soluble proteins are capable of aggregating is a well known frustration. Careful analysis, however, reveals that in many instances of disease, the aggregates are actually highly structured. These aggregates are typically called amyloid fibers and are defined by the presence of a central core of ?-strands stacked at right angles to the long axis of the fiber. The initial formation of such structures is a rare event. However, once present, fibers template and appear to catalyze their own formation. The resultant structures are exceptionally resistant to degradation and disassembly by chemical or proteolytic means.Projects currently underway are therefore focused on model peptides, islet amyloid polypeptide from type II diabetes, and b2 microglobulin which forms amyloid deposits in renal failure patients on dialysis therapy. Our approaches are kinetic, thermodynamic and structural in scope, enabling our investigations to be conducted at a molecular level. </p><p>Research in our laboratory is focused on conformational changes in proteins which give rise to a special class of protein complex known as amyloid fibrils. This folding problem is particularly fascinating as proteins which are seemingly unrelated in primary sequence and in their native 3 dimensional structure form aggregates which share common structural features. Depending on the protein involved, fibril formation gives rise or contributes to the pathogenesis of more than 20 clinical conditions. Projects currently underway in the laboratory include the islet amyloid polypeptide system which forms fibrils in the pancreas of type II diabetics, and beta-2 microglobulin which forms deposits on the connective tissues of long term dialysis patients. We are studying both the folding and the fibrillogenesis properties of these systems. Biophysical techniques enable these investigations to be conducted at a molecular level. These include high field NMR, optical spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.</p>'

We have gained valuable insights on the mechanism of virus entry in the host cell by determining the crystal structure of the envelope protein of dengue virus in two different conformations: before and after fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes.

The Toll-like receptors have the remarkable ability to recognize a wide variety of pathogen-derived structural motifs using the same extracellular leucine-rich repeat architecture. We seek to understand how this fold is able to recognize such a large variety of ligands and translate this recognition event into an inflammatory signal. We also study how flaviviruses enter cells. Flaviviruses use their envelope protein, E, to bind a cellular receptor and enter an endosome. The reduced pH of the endosome triggers a conformational rearrangement in E, inducing the viral and host-cell membranes to fuse. Our structures of E in the pre- and postfusion states suggest a mechanism for membrane fusion, but some aspects of this key fusion remain unclear. Completing our picture of the fusion process will help us design new antiviral therapeutics.</p>'

Retroviruses are tiny shells harboring viral genetic information which are able to replicate, spread and cause severe diseases such as the AIDS. This is possible, because these viruses have learned to take advantage of available cellular enzymes and to effectively evade the immune system. The Mothes lab is fascinated by the interdisciplinary nature of retroviral infections and seeks a comprehensive approach to its understanding.</p><p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 20px; color: #323232; ">Our laboratory works on the cell biological aspects of retroviral replication. Retroviruses are small particles of about 100 nm that carry a viral RNA genome surrounded by a viral capsid and a membrane envelope. Given their simple composition, retroviruses depend on cellular processes throughout their replication cycle. In addition, viral replication evolved in the presence of a strong innate and adaptive immune defense. Thus, retroviral replication is the result of a complex interdependence of viral biology, the utilization of cellular biological machineries, and immune evasion. To understand the retroviral life cycle we apply an imaging approach complemented by cell biological, genetic, and biochemical techniques. Live cell imaging allows us to monitor how viral components come together during assembly, to understand how viruses are transmitted from cell to cell, to determine when and where retroviruses infect cells and finally, to analyze at which point antiviral factors interfere with these individual steps.</span></p>'

S'<p>My laboratory studies the mechanisms and effects of calcium signals in polarized epithelia. One aspect of our work is to define how calcium signals are<br>differentially regulated in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This involves identification of distinct calcium stores and release mechanisms in the nucleus, and we are<br>examining whether and how these are activated selectively by growth factors. The second aspect of our work is to examine how calcium waves and&nbsp;other calcium signals regulate secretion in polarized epithelia. Calcium waves preferentially begin in, the apical region of most secretory epithelia, and&nbsp;we are in the process of defining the mechanisms responsible for this. We also are using an adenoviral antisense approach to understand the relative roles of each IP3 receptor isoform in regulating calcium signaling and secretion in vitro and in vivo. Another major focus is to examine intercellular communication of second messenger signals and to establish the mechanism by which gap junctions act in coordinating intercellular spread of Ca2+ waves in isolated pairs and triplets of cells.&nbsp;<br></p><p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 20px; color: #323232;">Our discovery and characterization of striatal phosphoproteins controlled by dopamine, including DARPP-32, RCS, and ARPP-16, provides a rational approach to the elucidation of the molecular actions of dopamine.

S'<p>Our laboratory applies cellular, molecular, genetic, and systems biology approaches to the question of how neuronal physiological properties determine the information processing characteristics of neural networks. We take an interdisciplinary approach to these questions. We manipulate the physiological properties of neurons in directed ways by genetically targeted cell-specific expression of engineered proteins in transgenic animals. These engineered proteins include ion channel subunits, intracellular ionic buffers, signaling enzymes, membrane-tethered neuropeptides, and membrane-tethered peptide neurotoxins that target specific ion channel subtypes. Subsequently, we measure the effects of these manipulations on the whole-animal behavior of intact flies as well as on various physiological parameters of the manipulated neurons using cell biological, neurophysiological, functional imaging, and genomics/systems biology techniques. As a model system for addressing these issues, we study the neural circuits that control circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, sexual courtship behavior, sleep, and energy metabolism in <em>Drosophila</em> melanogaster flies.<br><br>We also have a new project in the laboratory aimed at identifying novel analgesics from the venom of Australian funnel-web spiders.</p><p>One effortin the lab is aimed at understanding the formation of the regular venationpattern that appears to guide leaf cell differentiation on a fine scale.

Central to thisprocess are the bone marrow niches where immune cells develop. These are siteswhere hematopoietic precursors travel to meet with specialized bone marrowstromal cells that provide lineage-specific signals necessary for theirdevelopment and differentiation. Ourlaboratory is specifically interested in understanding the molecular mechanismsthat regulate hematopoietic cell development, positioning and migration withinbone marrow niches, and export into the periphery under normal homeostaticconditions.

Because the risks ofcolonization and disease are associated with host characteristics, thebiological agent, and the environment, her research requires an understandingof several different disciplines including epidemiology, microbiology, andstatistics. One major project utilizes a molecular epidemiologic approach toidentify tissue specific virulence factors of the gram-positive pathogen <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. <em>S. pneumoniae</em>colonizes the nasopharynx of up to 55% of healthy young children. Asymptomatic carriage is far more common thandisease, yet these bacteria are important causes of otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis,and meningitis. Conjugate vaccine formulations are available forchildren, but these do not cover all 92 pneumococcal serotypes. Given theseconcerns, and increasing rates of antibiotic resistance among pneumococcalisolates, it is important to gain a better understanding of the virulencecharacteristics of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> thatinfluence their propensity to cause disease. It is also important that weunderstand the distribution of these virulence determinants among strains incirculation at the population level. This will facilitate the development ofnovel strategies to prevent pneumococcal disease. <br><br>&nbsp;Additionalresearch projects focuses on the epidemiology of polymicrobial interactionsbetween S. pneumoniae and otherbacteria that colonize the same niche in the upper respiratory tract. &nbsp;Colonization by S. pneumoniae is a critical early stepin the disease process. Several hundred different bacterial species colonizethe upper respiratory tract of a single individual. Our research indicates that competitiveinteractions between bacteria in the nasopharynx differ by the number and typeof bacteria species present. These data have implications for the development of probiotics and for antibiotic andvaccination strategies that target carriage of colonizing bacterial species.Such strategies may alter the nasopharyngeal flora, which may in turn haveunintended consequences for disease incidence. We are expanding our research to examine interactions between bacteria and respiratory tract viruses(e.g. respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus) and by taking advantage ofrecent advances in pyrosequencing technology. Our newest projects utilize next generation 454 sequencing methods tocharacterize the microbial ecology of bacteria colonizing the upper respiratorytract of infants and young children. These data will also lead to increasedunderstanding of the human microbiome and how competitiveinteractions between bacteria and viruses lead to disease.</span></span></font></p>'

S'<p>My research is aimed towards a better understanding of a particular network of brain structures, called the basal ganglia, and the consequences of dysfunction of this network in various neuropsychiatric diseases.&nbsp; The basal ganglia are involved both in motor control and in the formation of habits.&nbsp; Abnormalities in this circuit are implicated in a variety of conditions characterized by maladaptive, inflexible behaviors - habits gone bad.&nbsp; These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction.&nbsp; <br><br>Our research in the laboratory has two strands.&nbsp; First, we seek to better understand the mechanisms of normal basal ganglia-dependent habit-like learning, by manipulating this circuit in mice and then testing their ability to learn a variety of tasks.&nbsp; Second, we seek to better understand how perturbation of the basal ganglia system can lead to symptoms of psychiatric disease.&nbsp; We do this by recapitulating some of the biology of diseases such as Tourette syndrome, again in mice, and observing the behavioral and neurophysiological consequences.&nbsp; <br><br>I also direct the Yale OCD Research Clinic, where our research aims towards the better understanding of the biology of obsessive compulsive disorder and the development of new treatments.&nbsp; We have observe that the neurotransmitter glutamate is out of balance int he basal ganglia in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and that medications that target glutamate appear to help patients whose disease has not responded to more standard therapies.&nbsp; Ongoing research seeks to better document and understand this perturbation of this neurotransmitter and to explore new glutamate-modulating drugs as potential treatments.</p><p><strong>STUDIES OF BASALGANGLIA FUNCTION IN MICE</strong>.&nbsp; The basal ganglia, consisting of thestriatum (caudate-putamen) and related subcortical structures, havehistorically been considered to have primarily motor functions; but it hasbecome increasingly clear that they are also involved in a variety of cognitiveand affective processes.&nbsp; Disruption of normal basal ganglia function isseen in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsivedisorder, Tourette syndrome, and drug addiction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The striatum has been divided into distinct functionalregions, though both the anatomical subdivisions and the functions with whichthey are associated remain approximate and subject to debate.&nbsp; The ventralstriatum, consisting of the nucleus accumbens and related structures, has awell-documented role in reward and reward-driven learning, and has beenextensively researched in the context of drug addiction.&nbsp; The dorsalstriatum (caudate and putamen, in primates) is thought to have a role in theformation of motor and cognitive patterns and in forms of implicit learning,including the formation of habits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pittenger laboratory is focused on the betterunderstanding of the mechanisms of dorsal striatum-dependent habit-likelearning, and of the consequences of its perturbation in variousneuropsychiatric conditions.&nbsp; We conduct our researches primarily in mice,which allows us to take advantage of sophisticated reverse genetic techniquesto perturb the striatal circuitry in molecularly precise ways and to targetspecific striatal subregions and neuronal subtypes.<br><br><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF NOVELBEHAVIORAL ASSAYS.</strong>&nbsp; A challenge in this line of work is thatstriatum-dependent learning processes have been less studied than thosedepending on other brain regions, such as hippocampus, cerebellum, andamygdala, and have barely been studied in mice at all prior to the last fewyears.&nbsp; A major thrust of our efforts has therefore been the establishmentand validation of behavioral assays of striatal function in mice.<br><br><strong>CREB INSTRIATAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AND STRIATUM-DEPENDENT LEARNING</strong>.&nbsp; Dr.Pittenger\xe2\x80\x99s initial work in this direction began during his Ph.D. studies withrecent Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, with the production of transgenic miceexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the ubiquitous transcription factorCREB specifically in the striatum.&nbsp; CREB has long been known to have aconserved role in the establishment of long-lasting plasticity; for example,Dr. Pittenger\xe2\x80\x99s earlier thesis work confirmed its role in the hippocampus inthe stabilization of spatial learning (Pittenger <em>et al</em>, <em>Neuron</em>, 2002).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the role of CREB-regulated processes in dorsalstriatum-dependent habit-like learning had not previously been directlystudied.&nbsp; We found that inhibition of CREB function in the dorsal striatumdisrupts cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity and several striatum-dependentlearning tasks (Pittenger <em>et al</em>, <em>J Neurosci</em>, 2006).&nbsp; This studyrepresented the first time that the detailed mechanisms of striatum-dependentlearning had been examined using genetic tools in mice.&nbsp; It alsoestablished a new paradigm (adapted from earlier work in rats) for the analysisof such learning processes in mice, laying the methodological groundwork forfurther analyses.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONSBETWEEN LEARNING SYSTEMS</strong>.&nbsp; More recent behavioral work in thePittenger laboratory has examined the interaction of dorsal striatum-dependentlearning with other types of learning and other circuits in the brain.&nbsp; Wedeveloped a novel cued water maze task for mice (again taking previous work inrats as our starting point), and found that the animals could learn to navigateusing distinct strategies driven by either local or spatial cues.&nbsp; Lesionsof the dorsal striatum disrupted cue-driven search, while lesions of the dorsalhippocampus disrupted spatial navigation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remarkable finding camewhen we looked at interactions: hippocampal lesions not only left cued learningintact, they enhanced it.&nbsp; Conversely, striatal lesions not only leftspatial learning unimpaired, they made it better.&nbsp; The same effect was seein our transgenic mice, in which striatal CREB is inhibited and corticostriatalplasticity is impaired: these animals have impaired cued learning but enhancedspatial learning (Lee <em>et al</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, 2008).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study was the first to document this sort ofbi-directional enhancement after discrete brain lesions.&nbsp; We interpret thecounter-intuitive results in terms of the multiple memory systems theory oflearning.&nbsp; This theory posits that the mammalian brain contains severaldifferent learning systems, adapted for different types of environmentalcontingencies.&nbsp; For example, the hippocampus is adapted for the processingof spatial or relational information, while the dorsal striatum is hypothesizedto be adapted for the gradual acquisition of discrete cue associations.&nbsp;Under normal circumstances they are activated in parallel; with training,whichever system is best able to master the relevant environmental contingency(e.g. to predict reward) comes to dominate.&nbsp; But in circumstances wheretwo systems produce disparate behavioral outcomes they can destructivelyinterfere with one another, or \xe2\x80\x98compete\xe2\x80\x99; this is particularly likely early intraining, before differential reinforcement has led to the predominance of onesystem.&nbsp; We interpret the enhancement of the function subserved by onesystem after manipulations of the other as evidence for the alleviation of suchcompetition.<br><br><strong>STRIATALSUBREGIONS</strong>.&nbsp; Our ongoing work in this direction seeks to refine ourunderstanding of the structures underlying cued and spatial learning and theirinteraction.&nbsp; The dorsal striatum is not a homogeneous structure;different areas receive projections from functionally distinct regions ofcortex and are therefore likely to process different sorts ofinformation.&nbsp; In particular, the dorsolateral striatum (the putamen, inprimates) receives projections from primary sensory and motor cortices, andtherefore is likely to be involved in acquisition of cue-driven learning suchas that we are seeing in the water maze task.&nbsp; The dorsomedial striatum,in contrast, receives input from association cortices and may have a moregeneral role.&nbsp; Indeed, studies in rats suggest such a dissociation, andour own preliminary data suggest that restricted lesions of the dorsomedialstriatum have very different effects from larger disruptions of the wholedorsal striatum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are addressing the question of functionaldissociation within the dorsal striatum in several ways.&nbsp; First, we seekto better define what is meant by the \xe2\x80\x98dorsomedial striatum\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98dorsolateralstriatum\xe2\x80\x99 in this context by examining striatal activation by water mazelearning in an unbiased way; we have found the different tasks to producedistinct patterns of striatal activation, enen though they share all sensory,motor, and motivational characteristics.&nbsp; Second, we are targeting lesionsto putative striatal subregions and examining the behavioralconsequences.&nbsp; Finally, we are targeting disruptions of CREB-mediatedtranscription to striatal subregions using recombinant adeno-associated viruses(rAAV), to see whether disruption in a restricted subregion is sufficient torecapitulate the effects we see when CREB is inhibited throughout the dorsalstriatum in our transgenic mice.<br><br><strong>NEW METHODOLOGIES FORPROBING AND PERTURBING STRIATAL FUNCTION</strong>.&nbsp; This latter projecthighlights another theme in the Pittenger laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s research portfolio, thedevelopment of novel tools for precise manipulation of specific mechanisms andcell populations in the dorsal striatum, and in other neural circuits.&nbsp;The production of transgenic mice allowed restriction of a molecularmanipulation to the dorsal striatum, but it does not suffice for more specifictargeting of manipulations to discrete subregions.&nbsp; For that purpose weare now using engineered rAAV vectors to deliver our CREB dominant negativeconstruct, and other gene products, into defined brain areas by stereotaxicsurgery.&nbsp; A first-generation vector, which we are currently using, allowsexpression of a CREB dominant negative in target brain regions of varyingsize.&nbsp; A second-generation vector, which is under development and workingwell in vitro, permits the temporal regulation of the delivered gene, such thatit can be turned on and off; this will allow behavioral experimental designsnot possible with static manipulations, such as dissociating learning fromrecall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major effort in the laboratory is the targeting ofdefined striatal cell populations.&nbsp; The striatum, like any other brainregion or structure, is not homogenous; it is made up of distinct populationsof principal cells and a number of different classes of interneurons.&nbsp;Different cell types are likely to make different contributions to striatalfunction, and perturbation of one or another cell type may result in discretebehavioral abnormalities or (in humans) patterns of psychopathology.&nbsp; Wehave developed a method, combining recombinant viruses with transgenic technologies,to perturb defined cell populations, without disrupting similar cells elsewherein the brain or neighboring cells of different types.<br><br><strong>MODELINGPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE</strong>.&nbsp; We are applying this technology to modelneuropsychiatric conditions affecting the striatum, especially Tourettesyndrome.&nbsp; This represents a third focus of the laboratory.&nbsp; Modelingpsychiatric disease in animals has proven enormously challenging, becauseetiology is often obscure and symptomatology is often difficult to translate tonon-verbal species.&nbsp; We believe that the development of valid modelshinges on a sufficient degree of understanding of pathophysiology to ensurevalidity when translating to animals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, studies at Yale and elsewhere are beginning toproduce such understanding in the case of Tourette syndrome. We are usinggenetic methods to produce putative models of Tourette syndrome based both onpost-mortem findings (in collaboration with Flora Vaccarino) and on geneticinsights (in collaboration with Matt State).&nbsp; These animals are then beingtested in a variety of behavioral assays to assess their recapitulation ofTourette syndrome phenomenology, explore secondary and tertiary consequences ofthe initial manipulations, and investigate the response to both established andnovel medications.<br><br><strong>A FOCUS ONTRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH: NEW MEDICATIONS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD)</strong>.&nbsp; The final focus of the Pittengerlaboratory is also translational.&nbsp; Dr. Pittenger is Director of the YaleOCD Research Clinic, where he has found glutamate-modulating medications to beof potential benefit in the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsivedisorder (a condition in which basal ganglia dysfunction is implicated).&nbsp;We are examining the behavioral and molecular effects of such glutamate-modulatingdrugs in animals, to better understand their role in patients with this andrelated conditions.&nbsp; <span><br></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>As new animal models ofdisorders of the basal ganglia, like OCD, become available, we hope to use thistranslational approach to advance our understanding both of the normal role ofthe basal ganglia in behavior and its perturbation in disease, and to developnew generations of therapeutics for the psychiatric population.</span></p>'

S'<p>Our laboratory investigates the molecular basis of cellular motility and cytokinesis. Actin-based cellular movements are essential for shaping organs&nbsp;during embryonic development, defense against microorganisms, and wiring the nervous system. Movement of cells out of primary tumors is the chief cause of mortality in cancer. Cytokinesis is essential for the replication of all cells and is still one of the least understood aspects of cell division. Half of the lab studies how assembly of actin filaments pushes forward the leading edge of motile cells and moves coated vesicles into cells. We discovered that Arp2/3 complex is both the central integrator of inputs from signaling pathways and initiator of actin&nbsp;filament assembly. Half of the lab uses fission yeast to study cytokinesis, still one of the most mysterious of cellular processes. We mapped the spatial and&nbsp;temporal pathway for the assembly of more than a dozen proteins in the equatorial contractile ring of actin filaments and myosin-II and are investigating&nbsp;how a formin protein mediates actin assembly and how cells trigger constriction of the ring at the end of mitosis.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We use biochemical, biophysical, cellular, and genetic experiments to study the molecular mechanisms of actin-based cellular movements. <br><br><span><!--[if gte mso 9]>Normal 0 0 1 149 851 7 1 1045 11.1282    <![endif]-->Actin-basedmovements: We study how cells control the assembly and disassembly of actinfilaments during cellular movements.

S'<p>RNA has many different important functions in the cell, from the transfer of genetic information to the catalysis of reactions that are essential for gene expression. Often it is the folded tertiary structure of an RNA, rather than its primary sequence, that is essential for function. Given the ubiquitous role of folded RNA in biology, we have set out to understand some basic principles: What are the building blocks for RNA tertiary structure and how is it energetically stabilized? What are pathways for reaching the folded state? How are RNA and ribonucleoprotein assemblies actively folded and unfolded by RNA remodeling enzymes such as helicases? Many of our studies focus on the self-splicing group II intron, which is a ribozyme that catalyzes its own excision from precursor mRNA and which has been shown to be a mobile genetic element that invades duplex DNA. The evolutionary impact, biological role and biotechnological applications of group II introns are of great interest. A rich source of information on RNA tertiary structure, these large ribozymes (~600 nts in size) assemble through complex networks of unusual tertiary interactions. They are excellent models for studying RNA folding because they fold directly to the native state through a series of structurally and energetically characterized intermediates. Using a combination of biophysical and chemogenetic techniques, we are identifying the molecular structure of group II introns and their folding intermediates, determining the energetic contribution of individual tertiary interactions, and monitoring the dynamic behavior of intermediates along the RNA folding pathway.</p><p>Our research focuses on exploring the underlying principles that govern folding, dynamic rearrangement, and stability of RNA molecules and RNA-protein interfaces. To address these issues, we focus on three major problems: 1) Group II introns, which are large self-splicing ribozymes and mobile genetic elements. We are elucidating the folding pathway and tertiary structure of these highly structured RNA molecules, while also examining their interactions with proteins involved in transposition. 2) DExH/D proteins, which are a diverse family of enzymes that manipulate RNA conformation in an ATP-dependent manner. We are studying the motor function and mechanism of the NPH-II helicase from Vaccinia and the NS3/4B/5A replication complex from Hepatitis C Virus. 3) This experimental work is complemented by the development of new computational approaches for analyzing RNA conformation.</p>'

In addition, we are investigating the mechanisms by which proteins achieve the exquisite specificity and efficiency that are characteristic of protein-ligand interactions and enzymatic catalysis. Our research focuses upon small proteins, particularly four-helix bundle proteins, that are amenable to study by a variety of biophysical, biochemical and molecular biological techniques.Designed Metal-Binding Proteins We have introduced novel metal-binding sites into two proteins: a designed four-helix bundle protein, a4 and the B1 domain of IgG-binding protein G. The metal-site designs are for both structural and catalytic tetrahedral Zn(II) sites. The structural sites enhance the stability of the proteins, whereas the catalytic sites aim to exploit the powerful nucleophilic activity of Zn(II)- bound water and to mimic natural enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase. A Model System to Study b-Sheet Formation. The factors that are important for a-helix formation are much better understood than those for b-sheet formation. This is largely because tractable model systems in which to study b-sheet formation have been lacking.

We have determined both the intrinsic b-sheet forming propensities of the amino acids and the energetics of pair-wise interactions across two strands of a b-sheet. The results of these studies allow us to formulate the first guidelines for rational b-sheet design.</p><p>Research interests of the Regan lab encompass protein structure, folding and design; protein-protein interactions and protein-RNA interactions.  Our research is problem based, and we use whatever techniques are most appropriate as a particular project develops.  Our research ranges from fundamental studies of protein stability to the design of novel protein-based nano-materials.  Our interest in protein-protein interactions ranges from the design of proteins with novel binding activities and characterization of their properties using a range of techniques including fluorescence, circular dichroism, surface plasmon resonance, NMR and x-ray crystallography to the specific inhibition of protein-protein interactions in vivo as a route to a novel class of anti-breast cancer agents.  Our interest in protein-RNA interactions is focused on structure and function of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP).  Fragile X Mental Retardation Syndrome  is the most common cause of inherited mental retardation in humans, and is caused by lack of functional FMRP.

S'<p><p>Many viruses establish chronic infections that persist for the lifetime of their hosts. Some of these viruses, including HIV, HBV, and HCV, are associated with a large degree of worldwide mortality. Current therapies for these infections are only moderately effective and are often limited by a number of variables. Therefore, new therapies for these diseases are needed. Our laboratory studies the host-pathogen interactions related to HBV infection. HBV infection leads to millions of deaths each year from liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We are investigating the relationships between HBV and cellular and immunological regulatory pathways, as these might be exploited therapeutically to block virus replication. These studies have the potential to expand the repertoire of antiviral drugs beyond those currently in use, and therefore significantly impact public health.</p><p><p></p>'

S'<p>Our research is focused on using budding yeast tostudy chromosome pairing, synaptonemal complex formation and geneticrecombination during meiosis, and the coordination of these processeswith meiotic cell cycle progression.</p><p>Our research is focused on thestructure and behavior of meiotic chromosomes, using <em>Saccharomycescerevisiae</em> as a model system. &nbsp;Specifically,we are interested in the interhomolog interactions that occur during meioticprophase and are necessary for reductional chromosome segregation at the firstmeiotic division. &nbsp;Important eventsinclude homologous chromosome pairing, assembly of the synaptonemal complex(SC), genetic recombination, and the formation of chiasmata. <br><br><strong>SC Proteins</strong><br><br>The SC is an elaborate proteinaceousstructure that assembles along the lengths of paired chromosomes during meioticprophase. &nbsp;The Zip1 protein is a majorbuilding block of the complex, where it serves as a bridge between the cores ofhomologous chromosomes. <br><br>A complex of proteins, called the synapsisinitiation complex (SIC), promotes the polymerization of Zip1 alongchromosomes. Components of this complexinclude Zip2, Zip3 and Zip4.&nbsp; In the <em>zip2 </em>and <em>zip4 </em>mutants, there is a complete failure of SC formation; incontrast, a subset of synapsis initiation events does occur in the absence of theZip3 protein.<br><br>Recent studies have revealed noveland unexpected functions for the Zip1 protein.&nbsp;In addition to its role as a structural component of the SC, Zip1 coupleschromosomes at their centromeres, represses crossing over near centromeres, andpromotes the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes.&nbsp; Furthermore, Zip1\xe2\x80\x99s special affinity forcentromeres defines these chromosomal regions as the earliest sites of synapsisinitiation.&nbsp; Importantly, synapsisinitiation at centromeres is subject to special regulatory mechanisms thatprevent SC formation in the absence of meiotic recombination.<br><br><strong>Zip1 Promotes Centromere Coupling</strong><br><br>Studies of the <em>spo11 </em>mutant,which fails to initiate meiotic recombination or make SC, revealed anunexpected role for the Zip1 protein. &nbsp;Inthe <em>spo11 </em>mutant, Zip1 localizes to foci on chromosomes, and these focicoincide with centromeres. &nbsp;Furthermore,there are 16 foci per nucleus, representing 16 centromere "couples". &nbsp;(A diploid yeast cell contains 32chromosomes.)&nbsp; In the <em>spo11 </em>mutant, coupling occurs predominantly betweenthe centromeres of nonhomologous chromosomes and is dependent on Zip1 andindependent of SICs.<br><br>In wild-type cells, centromeres arecoupled from the earliest stages of meiotic prophase.&nbsp; Prior to the initiation of SC formation, mostcentromere couples involve nonhomologous chromosomes, but couples becomeincreasingly homologous as meiosis progresses.&nbsp;Thus, centromere couples must switch partners until the centromeres ofhomologous chromosomes become coupled to each other. &nbsp;We propose that centromere couplingfacilitates homolog pairing by holding two chromosomes together in a stableconfiguration while homology is being assessed. <br><strong><br>Zip1 Promotes Synapsis Initiation at Centromeres</strong><br><br>Centromeres also play a role insynapsis initiation.&nbsp; At an early stagein synapsis, when short linear stretches of Zip1 are first observed, about 80percent of these regions of Zip1 staining are associated with centromeres. &nbsp;Furthermore, although SICs are not found atcentromeres in <em>spo11 </em>nuclei, they arefound \xe2\x80&#147; transiently \xe2\x80&#147; at centromeres in wild type.&nbsp; Thus, at early times in meiotic prophase,most synapsis initiates at centromeres. &nbsp;Asmeiosis progresses, synapsis initiation at noncentromeric locations makes anincreasingly important contribution. <br><br>Studies of synapsis initiation atcentromeres have revealed a number of unexpected features of the synapsisprocess. &nbsp;First, synapsis is oftenunidirectional, with Zip1 extending outward in only one direction from thecentromere. &nbsp;Second, SICs are not fixedin location; instead, they move at the leading edge of Zip1 polymerization. &nbsp;These observations contrast with thetraditional view that SICs remain fixed in position and synapsis extendsoutward in both directions from each SIC. <br><br>It remains to be determined whethersynapsis initiation at noncentromeric locations is mechanistically similar tosynapsis initiation at centromeres, with respect to directionality and SICmovement. &nbsp;There is at least oneimportant difference between the two categories of synapsis initiation.&nbsp; Synapsis initiation at centromeres isindependent of the Zip3 protein, whereas synapsis initiation at noncentromericlocations requires Zip3.<br><br><strong>Zip1 and Fpr3 Prevent Synapsis Initiation in the Absence ofMeiotic Recombination<br></strong><br>Zip1 couples the centromeres ofnonhomologous chromosomes in a <em>spo11</em>mutant and at early stages of meiotic prophase in wild type.&nbsp; What prevents Zip1 from polymerizing alongthe lengths of chromosomes under these conditions?&nbsp; &nbsp;Synapsiscan take place between nonhomologous chromosomes under certain conditions, sothere must be a regulatory mechanism that normally prevents SC formation untilhomologs are paired and recombination is initiated.&nbsp; To characterize this regulatory network, welooked for mutations that would allow extensive Zip1 polymerization in a <em>spo11 </em>mutant background.&nbsp; We found that a mutation in the <em>FPR3 </em>gene, in conjunction with amutation in the <em>ZIP3 </em>gene, allowssynapsis to occur even when recombination is not initiated.&nbsp; Most of the synapsis that takes place in the <em>spo11 fpr3 zip3</em> triple mutant involvesnonhomologous chromosomes, and almost all synapsis initiates at centromeres.Surprisingly, the synapsis that occurs in the absence of the Fpr3 and Zip3proteins is independent of Zip2, which previously has been shown to beabsolutely required for SC formation.<br><br>Taken together, these data suggestthat Fpr3 and Zip3 act in parallel and redundant pathways to prevent synapsisin the absence of double-strand breaks.&nbsp;The Zip2 protein may function specifically to overcome the inhibitionimposed by Zip3 and Fpr3.&nbsp; We postulatethat Fpr3 and Zip3 act by modifying Zip1 and/or other SC proteins.&nbsp; Zip3 is a SUMO ligase; Fpr3 is a prolineisomerase.&nbsp; It is surprising that Zip3 performsdifferent functions at different locations.&nbsp;Zip3 inhibits synapsis at centromeres, whereas it promotes synapsis atnoncentromeric locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Zip1 Represses Crossing Over Near Centromeres<br></strong><br>Meiotic recombination events,specifically crossovers, are nonrandomly distributed along chromosomes.&nbsp; One aspect of this nonrandomness is thatcrossing over is repressed near centromeres.&nbsp;We have measured crossing over on a genome-wide basis using DNA microarraysto monitor the segregation of ~8,000 polymorphisms.&nbsp; These results reveal a striking (~10 fold)decrease in crossing in the 10-kbp intervals on both sides of the centromere,as predicted by genetic studies.&nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, the centromeric repression ofcrossing over is abolished by a <em>zip1</em>null mutation. &nbsp;The <em>zip1 </em>mutation also increases the rate of gene conversion incentromere-proximal intervals, but it does not affect the frequency of meioticdouble-strand breaks.&nbsp; Thus, Zip1 mostlikely affects crossing over near centromeres by promoting interactions betweensister chromatids at the expense of interhomolog interactions.&nbsp; <br><br>Crossovers that occur too close tocentromeres cause chromosomes to missegregate in meiosis.&nbsp; Thus, Zip1 may help to ensure properchromosome segregation by preventing centromere-proximal crossovers.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Zip1 Promotes Distributive Disjunction</strong><br><br>Crossoverspromote the correct segregation of chromosomes at the meiosis I division bypromoting the formation of chromatin bridges called chiasmata.&nbsp; However, if one or a small number ofchromosome pairs fail to crossover, there is a backup system that facilitatestheir proper segregation.&nbsp; In wild-typecells, the rate of nondisjuction for nonexchange chromosomes is ~10%.&nbsp; This rate is elevated two to three fold by a <em>zip1 </em>mutation, suggesting a role forZip1 in promoting the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes.&nbsp; The effect of <em>zip1 </em>on nonexchange chromosome segregation is not due indirectly toits reduced level of crossing over and a consequent increase in the number ofnonexchange chromosomes: an <em>msh4</em>mutation decreases crossing over to the same extent as Zip1 but does notincrease the rate with which nonexchange chromosomes missegregate.&nbsp; Furthermore, cytological data indicate thatthe Zip1 protein holds nonexchange chromosomes together at their centromeresafter all other chromosomes are paired and synapsed with homologous partners.</p>'

S'<p>The research in our laboratory is focused on novel approaches to vaccine development based on recombinant viruses and on specific targeting of viral vectors. Several years ago our group developed methodology for generating recombinants of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) starting from plasmid DNA. VSV is a simple membrane-enveloped, negative-strand RNA virus that grows to high titers in most animal cells. These recombinant VSVs expressing foreign viral proteins induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses to the foreign proteins in animals and protect from infection or disease caused by other viruses such as influenza, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS, and a monkey AIDS virus. We are interested in understanding the mechanisms by which the recombinants generate such strong immune responses and in ways to enhance these responses further while improving vector safety. In addition, we are developing novel priming and boosting vaccine vectors based on propagating replicons of positive-strand RNA viruses.</p><p><span style="font-family: \'times new roman\'; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; ">Vaccine development employing vectors based on recombinant negative-strand RNA viruses.

S'<p>Inflammation involves a complex interplay of biochemical pathways that trigger and shape the immune response. These culminate in a coordinated response that is essential for protection against invading pathogens. Inflammation, if unchecked, can favor the development of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Thus, mechanisms that regulate its duration and intensity are fundamental to immune homeostasis. Our research interest is to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of inflammation and the homeostatic&nbsp;control of immune function. We have discovered a signaling pathway downstream of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptor tyrosine kinases that limits the amplitude and phase of the inflammatory response. We are currently focusing on identifying the in vivo source of TAM ligands, unraveling the molecular determinants that account for the specificity of TAM-mediated inhibition, decoding the transcriptome activated during TAM-mediated inhibition of inflammation, and testing the role of TAM-mediated immune suppression in vivo. Our long-term goal is to manipulate this pathway as an innovative therapeutic strategy for the inhibition or enhancement of the inflammatory response.<br></p><p><span style="font-family: \'times new roman\'; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; ">Vaccine development employing vectors based on recombinant negative-strand RNA viruses.

S'<p>Our research concerns the proteins involved in neurotransmitter recycling responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and other biogenic amines. We are interested in how the structure of these proteins determines their ability to couple ion gradients to substrate transport. The transporters are responsible for the process that terminates the action of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine released into the synaptic cleft. They are targets for antidepressant drugs like fluoxetine (Prozac) and for stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, such as MDMA (ecstasy). Current efforts in the laboratory include the identification of the pathway by which serotonin passes through the membrane, including residues that are involved in substrate and inhibitor binding and those involved in conformational changes that accompany transport. We are also studying the regulation of serotonin transporter activity by phosphorylation, and we are investigating bacterial homologues of the neurotransmitter transporter family for insights into the structure of these proteins.</p><p>Professor Ruddle\'s research concentrates on cell trafficking andinflammation, particularly with regard to the lymphotoxin/tumornecrosis factor (LT/TNF) family.

Receptor tyrosine kinases undergo ligand dependent dimerization which activates their intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domains. We have determined the crystal structure of Stem cell factor (SCF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), two ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, we have determined the crystal structure of FGF in complex with the extracellular ligand binding domain of FGF-receptor (FGFR) and with a heparin sulfate oligosacchride. The structure of the ternary FGF/heparin/FGFR complex provides a molecular view of how FGF acts in concert with heparin to induce the dimerization and activation of FGF-receptors. We have also determined the crystal structure of the catalytic PTK domain of FGFR in complex with an ATP analogue or in complex with specific PTK inhibitors of FGFR activity and function. These structures enabled the development of new specific inhibitor for PTKs that are currently being tested in clinical trials.   Receptor tyrosine kinases undergo ligand-dependent dimerization, which activates their intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity resulting in autophosphorylation and subsequent interaction and recruitment of multiple cellular target proteins. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues together with their immediate flanking sequences function as binding sites for signaling molecules containing src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Many signaling proteins carry SH2 domains plus one or more small protein modules such as SH3, PH, PTB, WW or FYVE domains. These protein modules function as mediator of protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions that are critical for signal transmission. In addition to direct recruitment by RTKs, many signaling proteins are recruited by an alternative mechanism involving a family of membrane linked docking proteins such as FRS-2a, and b, IRS-1 and 2, and Gab-1 and 2, among many others. Recruitment of signaling proteins by RTKs or by docking proteins leads to activation of multiple signaling pathways resulting in stimulation of a variety of cellular responses. The small adapter protein Grb2, for example, is bound through its SH3 domains to short, proline-rich sequences in the carboxy terminal tail of the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos. Interaction between Grb2 and Sos with tyrosine phosphorylated RTKs or docking proteins results in translocation of Sos to the plasma membrane allowing the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. The activated GTP-bound form of Ras then starts a kinase cascade composed of Raf, MAPKK, and MAPK leading to phosphorylation of prooncogene Jun on serine and threonine residues to induce transcriptional activation. These and other signaling pathways that are activated by RTKs regulate multiple cellular processes. Many cancers and other diseases are caused by dysfunctions in RTKs or in components of their intracellular pathways.</p>'

In addition to direct recruitment by RTKs, many signaling proteins are recruited by an alternative mechanism involving a family of membrane linked docking proteins such as FRS-2a, and b, IRS-1 and 2, and Gab-1 and 2, among many others. Recruitment of signaling proteins by RTKs or by docking proteins leads to activation of multiple signaling pathways resulting in stimulation of a variety of cellular responses. The small adapter protein Grb2, for example, is bound through its SH3 domains to short, proline-rich sequences in the carboxy terminal tail of the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor Sos. Interaction between Grb2 and Sos with tyrosine phosphorylated RTKs or docking proteins results in translocation of Sos to the plasma membrane allowing the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. The activated GTP-bound form of Ras then starts a kinase cascade composed of Raf, MAPKK, and MAPK leading to phosphorylation of prooncogene Jun on serine and threonine residues to induce transcriptional activation. These and other signaling pathways that are activated by RTKs regulate multiple cellular processes. Many cancers and other diseases are caused by dysfunctions in RTKs or in components of their intracellular pathways.</p>'

S'<p>Our laboratory investigates how neuronal identity and connectivity are established and maintained in the cerebral cortex. Pyramidal neurons occupy a central position in all cortical circuits and are compartmentalized into distinct layers, with each layer containing a unique set of pyramidal neurons and connections. Pyramidal neurons are generated by specialized stem cells called radial glial cells, in a specific temporal order, with deep layer pyramidal neurons generated first and superficial layer pyramidal neurons generated last. <br><br>In an effort to understand how the identity and sequential appearance of pyramidal neurons are regulated, our strategy is to identify genes that are expressed during these critical events and investigate their roles using a variety of molecular techniques. Our long-term goals are to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling cell type specification and regional patterning during cortical development, and how changes in genes that regulate these processes lead to changes in cortical organization during evolution and disease.</p><p>In our second line of research, we seek to identify species-specific evolutionary changes in gene expression, neuronal identity, and connectivity that may be important for the development and evolution of the human frontal cortex. There are no simple differences at the gross anatomic level of the cerebral cortex that can account for the uniquely human cognitive ability. Subtle differences in the large and complex set of cortical areas in the frontal lobes represent a neurobiological basis for specialized cognitive functions such as working memory, attention, planning, speech, language, and social information processing. Thus, comparative studies of gene expression and function in the developing frontal cortex and identification of genetic causes of human disorders affecting the frontal cortex offer insights into human uniqueness and the susceptibility to many neurodevelopmental disorders. <br><br>Our ongoing systematic comparative analysis of gene expression has identified a number of genes that exhibit cell type-, layer- or area-specific enrichment in the developing human frontal cortex. As a logical next step to determine whether these genes contribute to the evolution of the frontal cortex, we have analyzed the orthologs of these genes during the embryonic and postnatal development of mice, monkeys, and other mammals. <br><br>We are also interested in identifying human genes associated with abnormal development and function of the frontal lobe, as these could also be altered during human and primate evolution. Our objective is to learn how expression and function of genes shared between these species might have changed during evolution, leading to the expression of distinct traits in different species and giving rise to the larger, more complex human frontal cortex.</p>'

In this regard recent studies measuring muscle triglyceride content by biopsy or intramyocellular lipid content by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy have shown a strong relationship between intramuscular lipid content and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Recent studies have also demonstrated increases in intramyocellular lipid content in insulin resistant offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes suggesting that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism may be responsible for mediating the insulin resistance in these individuals. Increases in the intramyocellular concentration of fatty acid metabolites in turn have been postulated to activate a serine kinase cascade leading to decreased insulin stimulated insulin receptor substrate-1 associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity resulting in reduced glucose transport activity and glycogen synthesis. This presentation will focus on recent studies using noninvasive 13C, 31P and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques in humans that elucidate the pathogenesis of insulin resistance that occurs in obesity, type 2 diabetes, lipodystrophy and the metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Dr. Warren Shlomchik\xe2\x80\x99s lab studies Graft-vs.-Host Disease (GVHD) and Graft-vs.-Leukemia (GVL) in murine models of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. T cells that accompany stem cell grafts are key players in alloSCT. They can mediate a potent anti-neoplastic effect by recognizing host malignant cells as non-self. They are also critical for reconstituting anti-infectious T cell immunity. However, as currently practiced, alloSCT has two key drawbacks. First, donor T cells can mount a global attack on normal host tissues such as skin, liver, and intestines in a process called Graft-vs.-Host Disease (GVHD). Because of GVHD, all patients receive some type of immunosuppression which reduces GVHD, but at the cost of decreased immune reconstitution and GVL. Second, many neoplasms such as blast crisis CML are resistant to GVL for reasons yet to be elucidated. Dr. Shlomchik\xe2\x80\x99s lab uses murine models of GVHD and GVL to understand basic principles of antigen presentation, T cell activation, and T cell effector function with a goal of developing new therapeutic approaches to overcome these obstacles.</p>'

S'<p>My lab is interested in the molecular biology of human disease, especially cancer. At present, the lab is particularly interested in two genes, JAZF1 andJJAZ1/SUZ12, which we discovered and showed to be fused head to tail in the cells of certain uterine tumors. Little is known about the function of JAZF1, although single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene are associated with altered risk for type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer. JJAZ1is a Polycomb group gene (PcG), the product of which is essential for histone methylations that regulate chromatin remodeling and gene transcription. We have made significant progress in understanding how the JAZF1-JJAZ1fusion functions in oncogenesis, and the mechanism by which it acts has features not previously described in cancer. Recently, we found that JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA is produced by trans-splicing between the pre-mRNAs for the two genes in normal endometrium and that this production is regulated during the menstrual cycle. This discovery suggests that perhaps other examples among the many gene fusions known in cancer exert their oncogenic effects through the constitutive expression of chimeric RNAs normally generated in a regulated fashion by trans-splicing. The lab is currently vigorously testing this hypothesis and investigating its many biological implications.</p><p>Research in this laboratory generally concerns the molecular biology of human disease, particularly in the areas of the molecular genetics of cancer, lymphocyte biology, endometrial function, and the development of molecular methods for disease diagnosis. The research is of both a basic and translational nature.<br><br>A longstanding interest of the laboratory has been in chromosomal abnormalities associated with various forms of human cancer. Over the years, DNA fragments spanning the breakpoints in a number of chromosomal translocations have been molecularly cloned and used to identify oncogenes that lie at or near the sites of interchromosomal recombination. Among the genes identified in the laboratory through such studies are BCL2, a gene up-regulated in many cancers, particularly follicular B cell lymphomas, and critical in the control of apoptosis in normal tissues; NOTCH1, a gene for a cell surface receptor structurally altered in certain T cell leukemias and involved in the normal differentiation of many types of tissues; JAGGED2, a gene encoding a ligand for the NOTCH1 receptor; and MALT1, a gene mutated in one form of B cell lymphoma and a modulator of apoptosis in normal tissues. NOTCH1 and its orthologs continue to be studied both in terms of their modes of action and the tumors in which they act as an oncogene.<br><br>Most recently, two previously unknown genes\xe2\x80&#148;JAZF1 and JJAZ1 (now also referred to as SUZ12)\xe2\x80&#148;were discovered by us to be fused head to tail in most cases of endometrial stromal tumors. These two genes are currently the focus of intense investigation within the laboratory. JJAZ1 is a Polycomb group gene, the product of which is an essential member of the protein complex (Polycomb repressive complex 2, or PRC2) that in most or perhaps all cells catalyzes specific methylations of histone 3, leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing of DNA. The function of JAZF1 is less well understood; however, separate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within two introns of this gene have recently been shown to be associated with a strongly increased risk of type 2 diabetes and a decreased risk of prostate cancer. Both associations are now being investigated in the laboratory.<br><br>As alluded to above, we found several years ago that about 50% of endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESSs\xe2\x80&#148;cancers arising in the non-epithelial portion of the endometrium) contain the JAZF1-JJAZ1 gene fusion, most often as a consequence of the (7;17)(p15;q21) chromosomal translocation present in the tumor cells (Fig. 1). Additionally, the great majority of endometrial stromal nodules (ESNs\xe2\x80&#148;tumors of the endometrial stroma that histologically resemble ESSs but are considered benign) also contain the JAZF1-JJAZ1 gene fusion. We have also found that a consistent molecular feature distinguishing ESSs from ESNs is that the unrearranged JJAZ1 allele is silenced in ESSs but is active in ESNs. Using tissue culture cells infected with transducing retroviral vectors, we have shown that expression of the JAZF1-JJAZ1 gene fusion confers resistance to apoptosis (Fig. 2) and increased proliferative capacity, although the latter only when the normal JJAZF1 alleles are suppressed by siRNA. These data are consistent with ESNs arising from normal endometrial stroma through acquisition of the JAZF1-JJAZ1 gene fusion, and ESSs arising from ESNs after epigenetic silencing of the unrearranged JJAZF1 allele (Fig. 3). Assuming that this model is correct, it is the first known example of a sarcoma developing from a benign precursor.<br><br>A recent and related finding by the laboratory has been that chimeric JAZF1-JJAZ1 mRNA and protein can be found in normal endometrial stromal cell lines, as well as in normal endometrial tissues. Numerous studies using a variety of techniques have shown that this chimeric RNA does not derive from gene fusions but from trans-splicing of RNAs. Specifically, we have shown that extracts of normal endometrial stromal cell nuclei can catalyze trans-splicing between exogenous JAZF1 and JJAZ1 pre-mRNAs in vitro (Fig. 4). The implications of this finding are broad and include the possibility that other gene fusions, of which there are hundreds known among different types of cancers, may work similarly, by constitutively expressing chimeric RNA that is produced normally by physiologically regulated RNA trans-splicing within restricted windows during cell and tissue development. The laboratory is currently pursuing this hypothesis by attempting to identify further examples of trans-splicing in normal tissues between the pre-mRNAs of other genes involved in gene fusions within various cancers.<br><br>A continuing subsidiary interest within the laboratory has been the molecular analysis of lymphomas and the investigation of normal lymphocyte biology. In the past, this interest has led to the discovery of the frequent occurrence in normal lymphocytes of so called antigen receptor trans-rearrangments that create potentially functional chimeric genes containing V, D, and J segments from different antigen receptor genes. Another discovery relates to somatic hypermutation within rearranged immunoglobulin genes of certain subtypes of B cell cancers, and the greatly increased expression of certain DNA repair genes within germinal centers of lymph nodes, specifically at the anatomic site where this process is thought to occur. Finally, the laboratory was the first to develop evidence of the B lineage of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin\xe2\x80\x99s lymphoma and to demonstrate the presence of Epstein Barr virus in these cells. New projects related to these findings are still initiated from time to time.<br><br>Lastly, methods developed by the laboratory over the years have become widely used in diagnostic medicine, especially the application of antigen receptor gene rearrangements and molecular analysis of chromosomal translocations to diagnose lymphomas and other human cancers. Within this general area, the laboratory is continuing to work on new techniques for the improved use of nucleic acid markers in the diagnosis of human disease, and predominantly of cancer.<br></p>'

The primary interest of my lab is to use these techniques in conjunction with psychophysics and behavioral testing to uncover brain substrates of taste, smell, flavor, and food reward. We are particularly interested in multisensory integration of taste and smell as well as in understanding how sensory processing interacts with behavioral choices such as decisions to eat or stop eating in healthy individuals and in people with eating disorders. A new research aim is to examine similarities and differences in the neural representation of food and drug reward to answer questions such as how nicotine addiction may influence the ability of food odors to induce eating. We currently have a fully automated and fMRI compatible olfactometer and gustometer and are using these devices to study taste, smell and food reward in the 3 Tesla Magnet at the Yale MR Imaging Research Center.</p><p>Development, cancer and aging are intricately linked.

Currently twenty-two cotranslationally inserted amino acids (including selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) are known to occur in proteins. The synthesis of this set of amino-acyl-tRNAs is very diverse in nature, relying on direct acylation of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (as predicted by Crick\xe2\x80\x99s adaptor hypothesis) and also on recently discovered, novel mechanisms of pre-translational tRNA-dependent amino acid modification. The latter process is related to tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthesis (e.g., asparagine and cysteine), the sole route to these amino acids in many bacteria and archaea.

Future directions will increasingly focus on the complex macromolecular assemblies that are the functional machines in these processes, including the ribosome and the replisome. For example, we wish to establish the atomic structures of the ribosome captured in the act of protein synthesis in each of its conformational states with elongation and termination factors as well as interacting with the proteins and RNAs involved in protein secretion and membrane insertion. Likewise, a mechanistic understanding of replication and recombination will require structures of the assemblies in each step of the process.

S'<p><strong>Neural Repair and Neuro-Degeneration</strong><br><br>Neurological injury frequently interrupts connections while sparing nerve cells. Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is the epitome of a disconnection syndrome, in which surviving neural tissue fails to function due to lost communication at the level of injury. For the organism to regain function, new pathways must form by growth of cut or surviving nerve fibers. Unfortunately, the growth of axons and the rearrangement of brain circuitry are extremely limited in the adult brain and spinal cord.<br><br>We focus on understanding the molecular pathways that limit fiber growth and functional rewiring of neuronal circuits during health and disease. Axonal growth encompasses both neural plasticity and repair. Technically, we utilize chronic in vivo imaging of neuronal cennections, genetic alteration of mice and induction of surgical lesions resembling clinical SCI and Stroke. In particular, we have found that the NogoReceptor (NgR1) pathway mediating myelin inhibition of axonal growth plays a role in titrating anatomical plasticity in the adult CNS.<br><br>In Alzheimer\'s Disease and several other neurodegenerative conditions, nerve cells are lost over time. Molecular contributors to this pathology have been discovered by genetic methods, but their mechanism of action has remained poorly understood. We have focused on defining the pathophysiological action of Amyloid-beta (A\xc3\x9f) peptide oligomers in Alzheimer\'s Disease, and on the role of secreted Progranulin in Fronto-Temporal Dementia. For both of these molecules, interaction with the specific receptors on the neuronal surface is crucial. We utilize receptor ligand binding assays, expression cloning, electrophysiology, genetics and mouse behavior to study these pathways.</p><p><strong>Plasticity of Neural Connections</strong><br>Dynamic alterations of adult brain function, or NeuralPlasticity, can occur at the level of metabolites, protein chemistry, synapticmorphology, systems-level activation or anatomical rearrangement. FrankAnatomical Plasticity in the adult mammalian CNS is minimal in comparison tothe developing and adolescent brain. Classically, one of the last stages inneural development is the "critical period" during which activity hasa pronounced effect on connectivity, prior to entering the anantomically staticadult stage. We are exploring the molecular basis for restriction of AnatomicalPlasticity in the adult brain and spinal cord.<br><br><strong>Nogo Receptor in Plasticity</strong><br>Monocular deprivation normally alters ocular dominance inthe visual cortexonly during a postnatal critical period (20 to 32 days postnatal in mice).This is a period when intracortical myelination is reaching adult levels.Therefore, we focused on the role of the myelin inhibitor pathway inplasticity. Mutations in the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) affect cessation of oculardominance plasticity. In NgR1-/- mice, plasticity during the critical period isnormal, but it continues abnormally such that ocular dominance at 45 or 120days postnatal is subject to the same plasticity as at juvenile ages. Thus,physiological NgR signaling from myelin-derived Nogo, MAG, and OMgpconsolidates the neural circuitry established during experience-dependentplasticity.Our current work explores the anatomical basis of NgR1-regulatedplasticity. We hypothesize that alterations in Anatomical Plasticity underliethe electrophysiological evidence of increased cortical plasticity. We areusing in vivo imaging and conditional NgR1 alleles to test the ability of thispathway to titrate adult Anatomical Plasticity in the mouse cerebral cortex.Such regulation may underlie the genetic linkage of NgR1 mutations we havedescribed in human Schizophrenia.<br><br><strong>Chronic In Vivo Imaging</strong><br>Progress in defining the extent and control of AnatomicalPlasticity in the adult brain requires high resolution imaging of axons anddendrites over weeks. Fortunately, recent advances in two-photon microscopy andtransgenic expression of fluorescent proteins allow repeated imaging of anatomyover weeks in the adult cerebral cortex. These methods haverevealed that turnover of axonal varicosities and dendritic spines is mostpronounced in the developing and adolescent brain, and decreases in the adult.Specific changes in activity and experience are reported to enhance adultAnatomical Plasticity. We are now testing the role of NgR1 in corticalAnatomical Plasticity using constitutive and conditional genetargeting.<br><br><strong>Anatomical Plasticity after Injury</strong><br>From our studies of stroke and of surgical cuts of thecorticospinal tract in the medulla, it is clear that uninjured tracts canbeinduced to rearrange anatomically after injury to adult CNS. Furthermore,NgR1 limits the extent of this plasticity. Thus studies of AnatomicalPlasticity have relevance for Translational Neurology.<br><br><strong>Neural Repair</strong><br>Neurological disability has a diverse set of causes.Neuronal tissue can be injured by the loss of blood flow in atherosclerosis(cerebral stroke), by mechanical forces in trauma (spinal cord injury), byneurochemical perturbation in degenerative disease (Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s), bymicroorganisms in infectious diseases or by the immune system in multiplesclerosis.&nbsp; Disease-specific prophylactic approaches seek to preventtissue damage from occurring in the first place. Unfortunately, few such approachesare successful and many individuals suffer with chronic neurologicaldisabilities.&nbsp; After an injury has occurred, current rehabilitationmedicine relies primarily on physical therapy and employs pharmacologicalagents only to combat secondary complications.&nbsp; Stem cells may someday beadapted to replace lost tissue, but there are many hurdles to the rapiddevelopment of such therapy.<br><br>We seek to harness the potential of surviving tissue torestore function. To support neurological function, nerve cells must beconnected electrically by long cellular fibers, termed axons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Innearly all neurological conditions, a substantial portion of brain and spinalcord is preserved. If remaining healthy tissue can be \xe2\x80\x9crewired\xe2\x80\x9d withappropriate axonal connections, improved neurological function can result. Theformation of new connections and the recovery of function after injury dependupon new axonal extension from remaining cells. Without treatment, axonalgrowth is extremely limited in the adult brain and spinal cord, and recovery istypically restricted.&nbsp; Today, no FDA-approved therapeutic promotes newconnections between surviving nerve cells. <br><br><strong>Nogo Receptor and Myelin inhibition</strong><br>It has been known for a number of years that the whitematter of the CNS inhibits axon growth in the adult brain and spinalcord.&nbsp; A molecular characterization of inhibitors in CNS myelin led to ouridentification of the protein, Nogo.&nbsp; We also identified a receptorprotein for Nogo termed Nogo-66 Receptor, or NgR1.&nbsp; In vitro assays ofneurite outgrowth and ligand receptor binding were developed to identify andcharacterize this pathway. With this ligand receptor pair in hand we havedeveloped peptide and protein inhibitors of Nogo Receptor signaling.&nbsp; Suchmolecules selectively block the inhibitory effect of myelin on axon growth invitro. <br><br>Nogo and Nogo Receptor antagonists have been testedextensively by us and by others in animal SCI models. Molecules with Nogo/NgR1blocking activity promote the growth of axons in the adult spinal cord andpromote recovery of walking performance in injured animals withoutside-effects. We have demonstrated benefit in both acute and chronic spinalcontusion models with NgR(310)ecto-Fc protein therapy. Functionalrecovery of rats after stroke is also enhanced by thistreatment.&nbsp;We are working to optimize blockers of this system for clinical use withstructural biology, mutagenesis and high-throughput screening methods.&nbsp;Weare also working to expand knowledge of NgR1-initiated signaltransduction.<br><br><strong>Other Limits on Neural Repair</strong><br>The Nogo/ NgR1 pathway plays a prominent role in vivo, butitis not the only molecular brake on neurological recovery. We are activelystudying ephrins, CSPGs, SPRRs, LRRTMs, ROCK, RGMs and other pathways forsynergy with the NgR pathway.<br><br><strong>Neuro-Degeneration</strong><br>In neurodegenerative conditions, neuronal components andbrain function are progressively lost. A spectrum of genes has been implicatedin these diseases but mechanistic understanding remains sparse. We have focusedon the pathophysiology of A\xc3\x9f in Alzheimer\'s Disease, and Progranulin inFronto-Temporal Dementia. In both cases, interaction of extracellulardisease-associated ligands with the specific receptors on the neuronal surfaceis crucial, but had not been defined.<br><br><strong>Alzheimer\'s Disease </strong><br>Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) is the most common cause ofage-related dementia, affecting more than 25 million people worldwide. Theaccumulation of insoluble \xc3\x9f-amyloid (A\xc3\x9f) plaques in the brain has long beenconsidered central to the pathogenesis of AD (green in panel to right).However, recent evidence suggests that soluble oligomeric assemblies of A\xc3\x9f maybe of greater importance. APP processing yields A\xc3\x9f monomers, which undergooligomerization, eventually forming amyloid fibrils and plaques. A\xc3\x9f oligomershave been found to be potent synaptotoxins, but the mechanism by which theyexert their action had remained elusive. We recently found that cellular prionprotein (PrP-C) is a high-affinity receptor for A\xc3\x9f oligomers, mediating theirtoxic effects on synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that the A\xc3\x9f/PrP-C interaction leads to dendritic spineretraction via synaptotoxic action, with subsequent neuritic dystrophy andneurodegenerative pathology. These later steps are then coupled to tauopathy andmemory impairment in AD. We are employing biochemical analysis, in vivo imagingof dendrites, genetic investigation and behavioral studies to test thishypothesis. With PrP-C as a molecular target, we have launched a drug discoveryprogram for novel AD therapeutics.<br><strong><br>Fronto-Temporal Dementia</strong><br>Of inherited Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD) cases,haploinsuffiency of Progranulin is the most common etiology. TDP-43 depositionoccurs in Progranulin-deficient FTD, as well as in sporadic FTD cases and inALS. Because Progranulin is a secreted glycoprotein, we searched for highaffinity receptors by expression cloning. We are now characterizing a specificbrain protein as a Progranulin receptor. <br><br><strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis </strong><br>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neurondisease. Transgenic mouse models have suggested that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress and deficits in ER chaperone function are contributors to ALSpathophysiology. We have shown that NogoA contributes to the proper function ofthe ER resident chaperone PDI, and is protective against ALS-likeneurodegeneration. Our results provide a novel intracellular role for reticulonproteins and support the hypothesis that modulation of PDI function is apotential therapeutic approach to ALS. We are now working to optimize cellularreplacement therapy for ALS.</p>'

Gliocladium roseum (NRRL 50072) is an endophytic fungus recently isolated from Northern Patagonia that produces and excretes a broad spectrum of straight and branched medium chain-length hydrocarbons, including heptane, octane, undecane, dodecane and hexadecane, when grown in an sealed vessel. G. roseum can also generate and release these products when grown on cellulose, the world\'s most abundant natural organic compound. This organism has the potential to produce desirable biofuels via a fermentation process that is nearly carbon neutral. It is a basic science observation with clear implications for energy production and utilization.<br></DIV><DIV>The goals of this project are to characterize the biosynthetic basis of hydrocarbon production and release by G. roseum, to isolate the enzymes responsible for hydrocarbon synthesis and transport, and to use this information to optimize the yields of biofuel output. Overproduction will be achieved either by biological engineering of keys genes in the pathway, or transfer of the biosynthetic pathway to organisms used in standard fermentation processes. The hydrocarbon products and their derivatives will be subjected to chemical analysis and combustion studies. Realization of these goals will transform this basic science observation into real world applications that could transform the source and long-term availability of petroleum fuels.<br></DIV><DIV>We also have several ongoing projects in the area of RNA biochemistry.<br></DIV><DIV>Protein Synthesis. <br><br>Crystallographic studies reveal that the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center is composed exclusively of rRNA, i.e., that the ribosome is a ribozyme. We aim to determine how this biologically fundamental reaction is catalyzed. We are taking several approaches to understand this enzyme, including: (i) synthesis and characterization of transition state inhibitors; (ii) preparation of modified A-site and P-site tRNA substrates to test for substrate assisted catalysis of peptide bond formation by enzyme kinetic analysis; (iii) purification of mutant ribosomes to assess the role of rRNA functional groups; (iv) investigating the reaction transition state by kinetic isotope effect analysis and by determining the Br\xc3\xb8nsted coefficient for the ester aminolysis reaction.<br></DIV><DIV>Intron Splicing. <br><br>The discovery of the RNA self-splicing group I intron provided the first demonstration that not all enzymes are proteins. We recently reported the X-ray crystal structure of a catalytically active group I intron splicing intermediate. This is the first splicing complex of any kind to include a complete intron, both exons and an organized active site occupied with metal ions. The exon ligation is chemically equivalent for pre-mRNA splicing by the spliceosome. As a result, the chemical themes of splice site selection, exon alignment, and catalytic metal ion positioning, which are manifest in this splicing intermediate complex, are likely to find parallels in pre-mRNA splicing. We are now undertaking several additional structural and biochemical studies to characterize the entire RNA splicing pathway. The overriding goals of these studies are to: (i) understand the mechanism of RNA splicing, (ii) explain how RNA tertiary structure is formed and active sites created in the absence of proteins, (iii) reveal how metal ions contribute to RNA catalysis, and (iv) visualize the nature of the transition state of the phosphoryl transfer reaction promoted during exon ligation.</DIV></p>'

S'<p>An essential aspect of science is an understanding of the ontological and epistemological aspects of scientific knowledge. This understanding can often be approached through historical analysis and reflections on science. My research is focused on molecular biology as a typical modern scientific endeavor and on cross cultural and cross national aspects of science. For example, the early history of molecular biology is embedded in the work of physicists who applied concepts from physics to biological systems. One major aspect of this early work was the development of the target theory. The detailed history of the origins of the target theory has been reconstructed from the published literature and from archival material.

The plague andits aftermath were to play an important role in the geopolitical eventsleading up to the Japanese takeover of Manchuria and complex causes ofWorld War II. The concentrated force of this epidemic, its near 100percent mortality rate, and its occurrence in a region of internationalcompetition and diplomatic struggle all contributed to the importanceand interest in the Manchurian plague. The "Manchurian Question" was ofimmense interest in the United States: America had just enjoyed itsfirst taste of successful international leadership upon Roosevelt\'sbrokering the peace treaty of 1905 that ended the Russo-Japanese warover territorial rights in Manchuria. Russia, on the other hand wasintent on retaining what she could of her centuries-old foothold ineast Asia.

S'<p>Endogenous free radicals and environmental agents such as ionizing radiation induce DNA double-strand breaks. The repair of these breaks is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability. Two distinct pathways help eliminate DNA double-strand breaks. In homologous recombination, the repair of a broken DNA molecule requires an intact homologous duplex to direct the process. Alternatively, a pathway known as non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) simply rejoins the ends of the broken DNA molecule. Our research efforts focus on delineating the mechanisms of these two DNA repair pathway.<br><br><strong>Repair by homologous recombination </strong><br>The recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks is mediated by a group of genes called the RAD52 epistasis group. In mammals, the efficiency of recombinational DNA repair is modulated by the tumour suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, providing compelling evidence that this repair pathway functions to suppress cancer formation. Importantly, recombinational DNA repair is also required for the removal of interstrand DNA crosslinks induced by bifunctional crosslinking agents, which are commonly used to treat various malignancies. In 1994, we identified the yeast Rad51 protein, a key member of the RAD52 group, as the recombinase that mediates the \xe2\x80\x9chomologous DNA pairing and strand exchange \xe2\x80\x9creaction central to all recombination-dependent processes, including the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

Aside from kidneytransplantation, no treatment is currently available.&nbsp; <span></span><br><br>Recent studies point to the critical role of the cilium in PKD pathogenesis. <br><span>Protruding from the cell into its environment andanchored in the cell through the basal body, a microtubule organizing center,the cilium is well situated to act as a platform for multiple signalingpathways. Once obscure, the cilium is being linked to a growing list of humandiseases, ranging from infertility, obesity to mental retardation.Understanding how ciliary signal regulates important cellular functions willprovide insight to these diseases. Our research in the past few years uncoveredfunctional links between the cilium and multiple signaling pathways includingthe Wnt pathways and the TSC-TOR pathway. <br></span><span><br>&nbsp;However, the link between cilia and PKD is largely basedon \xe2\x80\x9cguilty by association\xe2\x80\x9d arguments. Additionally, the signal sensedby cilia remains controversial and the signaling pathway that couplescilia to cell proliferation is almost completely unknown.Through a forward genetic screen in zebrafish carried out in Dr.Nancy Hopkins\xe2\x80\x99 laboratory at MIT, we identified multiple novel genesinvolved in PKD. Based on preliminary analyses on these mutants, weproposed a revised model in which cilia function as sensors for lumensize of epithelial tubes. Defects in cilia formation or function leadto uncontrolled expansion of lumen size and eventually cyst formationin local areas.Using mutants isolated in the screen as entry points, we now startto unravel the genetic network that regulates the size of renal tubes.We are particularly interested in, but not limited to the followingthree questions: First, how is the cilium built during development?Second, what is the signal sensed by cilia? Third, how does signal fromcilia eventually regulate tube size? We believe addressing thesequestions will help us understand size control during development andmolecular etiology of PKD</span><br><span><br>In the future, we will continueto dissect how ciliary signal regulates downstream signaling pathways at bothmolecular and cellular levels.

S'<p>The focus of my research is genomic instability and how it leads to the mutations that result in human diseases such as cancer. The goal of one of the projects in my laboratory is to understand how DNA polymerases synthesize DNA accurately, and how they make mistakes that result in mutations. We study DNA mammalian DNA polymerase beta (Pol \xc3\x9f) because it was a relatively small, single subunit enzyme that could be easily manipulated and purified. My laboratory developed a method for assessing the activity and accuracy of rat Pol \xc3\x9f in bacteria. This led to the identification of a number of variants of Pol \xc3\x9f that synthesized DNA inaccurately. Our focus upon detailed biochemical characterization of variants of the Pol \xc3\x9f protein has shown that single amino acid residues that are quite distant from the active site of the enzyme are very important for accurate DNA synthesis. We found that many of these residues act at a distance in DNA positioning, nucleotide binding, and by influencing the rates of conformational changes that are important for accurate DNA synthesis. A second project is focused upon tumor-associated variants of Pol \xc3\x9f. Pol \xc3\x9f functions in base excision repair. The base excision repair system is responsible for removal of at least 10,000 DNA lesions per day. Interestingly, the Pol \xc3\x9f gene appears to be mutated in a large percentage of tumors. We have found that expression of the tumor-associated variants in mouse cells results in cellular transformation that has a mutational mechanism. We have shown that some of the Pol \xc3\x9f variants synthesize DNA inaccurately and others have no catalytic activity, but can bind to DNA and interfere with its repair. Our results suggest that the variants compromise base excision repair and lead to the induction of mutations, and suggest that base excision repair itself is a tumor suppressor mechanism. These studies impact our fundamental understanding of DNA repair and have the potential to lead to the design of targeted cancer therapeutics.</p><p>A major goal of the research conducted in my laboratory is to study the relationship between mutations and cancer. Therefore we concentrate our efforts on studying the mechanism of mutagenesis by a DNA polymerase, polymerase \xc2\xa7 (Pol \xc2\xa7). We employ genetic screens to identify amino acid residues of Pol \xc2\xa7 that function in promoting the fidelity of DNA synthesis. The Pol \xc2\xa7 mutant proteins identified in these screens are then analyzed using kinetics to determine the mechanism(s) Pol \xc2\xa7 employs to synthesize DNA accurately. <br><br>We also study the cellular role of Pol \xc2\xa7 and have shown that Pol \xc2\xa7 participates in base excision repair and in the process of meiosis. We are pursuing these studies to determine how Pol \xc2\xa7 makes errors during base excision repair and to identify the role of Pol \xc2\xa7 in meiosis.Pol \xc2\xa7 IgG stains discrete foci on mouse chromosome homologs during prophase I of meiosis in mouse spermatocytes.

S'<p>Cells have a remarkable ability to self-organize. Cellscreate within their boundaries compartments, each performing uniquebiochemical reactions to promote cell survival and function. Forexample, the axon of a neuron transmits specific signalling informationto other cells whereas the dendrites of that same neuron function toreceive and process information form other cells. To achivethis levelof organization cells need to target proteins invovled in a commonbiochemcial reaction to a specific region of the cell. One way thatcells accomplish this task is through mRNA localization. mRNAlocalization is the transport of specific mRNAs to specific locationsin the cell where upon arrival, translation of the mRNAs generatespools of localized proteins. Using mRNA localization, a cell needs totransport only a few copies of an mRNA to generate large amounts oflocalized protein and can spatially coordinate protein synthesis withexternal or developmental signals through translational regulation oflocalized mRNAs. Our lab is interested in understanding the molecularmechanisms that generate localized mRNAs. In particular, we are eagerto learn how molecular motors transport mRNAs, how mRNAs are anchoredat their localization site, and how the translation of these mRNAs iscontrolled. We study the localization of ASH1 mRNA to the bud tip in the yeast S. cerevisiae.ASH1 mRNA is transported to the bud tip by the myosin motor, Myo4p, andprovides a unique opportunity to combine genetic, cellular andbiochemical methods to reveal the mechanisms of mRNA localization. Weare also examining how mRNAs are localized in neurons using both livecell imaging to analyze mRNA transport and biochemistry to identify theproteins that mediate localization of mRNAs in neurons.</p><p>A major goal of the research conducted in my laboratory is to study the relationship between mutations and cancer.

S"<p>Our research efforts are directed at understanding the molecularmechanisms by which mammalian parvoviruses target particular celltypes, express their genes, take over their host cells and replicatetheir own DNA. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems, coupledwith directed mutagenesis, are currently being used to separate thevarious functions of the complex, multi-functional parvoviral geneproducts, in order to understand how the virus subverts themacromolecular metabolism of its target host cell to its own ends. Weare currently applying this knowledge to the construction of vectorsfor transducing immunomodulatory genes into tumor cells as therapeuticstrategy against cancer.</p><p><strong>How parvoviruses enter their host cell and traffic to thenucleus</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Parvovirusesdo not have a lipid envelope, and so cannot deliver their virions into the hostcell by fusing with its plasma or endosomal membranes.&nbsp; These viruses have developed analternative strategy to breach their host cell's outer membrane and gain entryinto the cytoplasm.&nbsp; We haverecently shown that the compact, icosahedral virion of the murine parvovirusMinute Virus of Mice, MVM deploys a lipolytic enzyme, phospholipase A2(PLA2) that is expressed at the N-terminus of the minor coatprotein, VP1.&nbsp; This region of VP1is normally sequestered within the viral shell, but is extruded during theentry process as a capsid-tethered domain, via an 8\xc3\x85 pore that extends throughthe prominent 5-fold cylinder. [Figure] In addition to the PLA2domain, the extruded VP1 N-terminus also displays a number of small proteininteraction domains predicted to engage both ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4family, involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, and nuclear transportproteins of the alpha-importin family.&nbsp; We arecurrently collaborating with Dr. Michael Hodsdon, in our Department, todetermine the structure of this polypeptide domain by NMR spectroscopy, inorder to understand how it unfolds and refolds during its transition throughthe 5-fold pore.&nbsp; The sequentialconformational shifts within the particle that allow this&nbsp; transition to occur as the virion transitsits entry pathway, exposing first its VP2 N-termini, then its VP1 N-termini andultimately its DNA are being analyzed using X-ray crystallography andasymmetric cryo-electron microscopy, in a collaboration with Drs. SusanHafenstein and Michael Rossmann at Purdue University.&nbsp; Finally, we are using reverse genetics combined withdifferential real-time PCR, sub-cellular fractionation and in situ imagingtechniques, to explore the roles of the VP1 N-terminal domain in thetrans-cytosolic trafficking and nuclear import of MVM virions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Manipulatingthe oncoselectivity of parvoviruses in human tumor models</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the rodentparvoviruses will bind to and enter human cells with high efficiency, but failto initiate gene expression, replicate their genomes, generate progeny orspread through the culture, unless the host cell is neoplastically transformed.&nbsp; As a consequence, these viruses arepromising candidates as oncolytic agents for cancer therapy, particularly insituations where other treatments have proven ineffective.&nbsp; Our current efforts are directed towardunderstanding, at the molecular level, why cellular changes that accompanyoncogenic transformation promote viral growth, and how we can use thisknowledge to further improve the efficacy of the virus in tumoreradication.&nbsp; Since tumorigenesisnormally involves loss of genomic integrity, tumor cells carry many mutationsthat are secondary to those causing the transformed phenotype.&nbsp; To avoid studying or selecting forviral traits that represent adaptations to such \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d transformed cellproperties, we are using host cells that have been transformed in a stepwisefashion with activated oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor knock-downs.&nbsp; Currently we are exploring thecontribution of the viral capsid and initiating promoter to the discriminationbetween normal and transformed cells, using stepwise transformed humanfibroblasts and melanocytes, the latter being a model for malignantmelanoma.&nbsp; These studies aredirecting strategies for selecting more oncotropic versions of these criticaloncoselective elements, using gene shuffling and degenerate promoter libraryapproaches.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Translationalstudies on a newly-discovered human bocavirus</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanbocavirus (HBoV) is a human parvovirus that was discovered in 2005 and shown tobe present in a significant fraction of bronchioalveolar samples from childrenpresenting in the clinic with respiratory tract infection.&nbsp; We have been developing tools that willallow us to study this virus in the clinic, and to explore its biology in thelaboratory.&nbsp; Using baculovirustechnology, we have derived HBoV virus-like particles with which we havedeveloped diagnostic assays for HBoV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies.&nbsp; We have used these to show thatinfection with this virus is common in very young infants.&nbsp; Currently we are involved in developingprospective and retrospective seroepidemiological screens, in an attempt toidentify potential clinical sequelae of infection with this ubiquitous agent.&nbsp; In addition, we are attempting to growthe virus in cell culture, in order to study its non-structural polypeptides,particularly the function of the unique bocaviral NP1 protein.</p>"

S'<p>Our basic research program focuses on dysfunction of cortico-limbic-striatal circuits that subserve dysfunctional cognitive control, impulsivity and alterations in reward-related learning with relevance to drug addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and Tourette Syndrome. Our current studies examine how DA/PKA-regulated intracellular signaling and neurotrophin molecules within the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and accumbens contribute to motivation, learning, and memory processes, including memory reconsolidation. Studies in monkeys have found long-lasting deficits in inhibitory control after repeated cocaine exposure and alterations in reward-related learning. We have recently developed a novel corticosterone model of depression and also examine sex differences in attention, motivation, and impulse control in rodents and underlying molecular alterations. Several addictive/abused drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, PCP, THC, nicotine, and alcohol are examined using drug self-administration models. We use transgenic mouse models, intracerebral infusion techniques, and viral-vector mediated overexpression of targeted proteins in combination with sophisticated behavioral techniques in mice, rats, and monkeys.</p><p>Examples of some major scientific accomplishments: Advanced the Hypothesis of \xe2\x80\x9cFrontostriatal Dysfunction in Addiction\xe2\x80\x9d. Her work has provided behavioral and biochemical evidence that drug-induced neuroadaptations in cortical and subcortical brain regions result in dysfunctional decision-making abilities and loss of impulse control that, in combination with enhancements of incentive motivation, may contribute to compulsive, habit-driven, behavior in addiction. This theory has received significant attention and has had a major impact on current work in drug addiction research ranging from basic molecular mechanisms, to neurophysiology, and to human neuropsychology and imaging studies. It is, consequently, a major research focus in the field of addiction biology. Her published work in this area has had far reaching impact and includes many \xe2\x80\x9cfirsts\xe2\x80\x9d, for example, showing drug-induced cognitive deficits in orbitofrontal cortex in monkeys as well as in rodent models. Most recently she has extended this work to examine the neurobiology of goal directed actions vs. habitual behavior. This paper was the first to demonstrate a selective modulation of behavior by sex chromosome genes, completely independent of gonadal hormone status.&nbsp; Using a mouse model that segregates sex chromosomes (XX vs. XY) from gonadal phenotype (ovaries vs. testes), she found a sex difference in the rate of habit formation whereby XX mice show faster habit formation compared to XY mice, irrespective of hormonal \xe2\x80\x98sex\xe2\x80\x99 status.&nbsp; These data provide new insight into the neurobiological bases of sex differences in the etiology of human habitual or compulsive psychopathologies, such as drug addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Together these findings have also had a major influence because Dr. Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s work and emphasis has been on delineating cellular/molecular mechanisms the underlie complex psychological processes.

S'<p>A long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand how the exo-endocytic cycle is spatially regulated during cellular morphogenesis. Two major focuses are the spatial-temporal regulation of membrane traffic in adipocytes in response to insulin signaling and in fibroblasts during cell migration.

S'<p>Neural stem and progenitor cells give rise to neurons and glia (the central nervous system supporting cells) at both prenatal and postnatal stages of development. The proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neural stem cells into a large variety of neuronal and glial cell types are regulated by a complex array of factors. We study how cell-to-cell contacts and signaling systems govern the behavior of neural stem cells and brain plasticity in the embryonic and postnatal periods. Our goal is to understand whether abnormal proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells contributes to the genesis of disorders such as autism, Tourette syndrome, and developmental disabilities. We recently founded the The Program in Neurodevelopment and Regeneration. The objectives of this new interdepartmental program are to use induced pluripotent cells (iPSC) as a tool to understand neuronal development in individuals with specific neuropsychiatric disorders. Neuronal development will be recapitulated in vitro by differentiating neuronal progenitors of various CNS lineages from iPSC lines. &nbsp;This will allow us to perform cellular, molecular, genetic, epigenetic and functional studies of these cell lines.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vaccarino laboratory has elucidated crucial mechanisms that regulate neural stem cell self-renewal, survival and differentiation. The lab has been redefining the roles of astroglial cells\xe2\x80&#148;extremely diverse cellular elements that evolve from a primary role of neural progenitors during embryonic development, to essential partners in neuronal migration, maturation, axon guidance. These cells have essential metabolic function in the adult brain and retain ability to divide and act as precursors.&nbsp; <br><br>In the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s Vaccarino and colleagues reported that an extracellular protein called Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) increases the number of progenitors for excitatory cortical neurons in vitro (Vaccarino et al., 1995) and that a single microinjection of FGF2 into the cerebral ventricles of rat embryos doubled the number of excitatory neurons generated during cortical development (Vaccarino et al., 1999). This was the first evidence that a single factor can elicit a permanent increase in cerebral cortical size and neuron number in a mammalian species. Conversely, using knockout mice, Vaccarino and colleagues demonstrated that the Fgf2 gene product is essential for the generation of a normal number of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex by increasing cell proliferation in the cortical neuroepithelium (Vaccarino et al., 1999; Raballo et al., 2000; Korada et al., 2002). Subsequent work of demonstrated that FGF receptors are essential for normal telencephalic development. The disruption of the Fgfr1 gene is sufficient to thwart cell proliferation within the hippocampal primordium, causing lifelong hippocampal atrophy (Ohkubo et al., 2004). In contrast, the antagonism of all FGF receptors is required to disrupt cortical development. Driving a dominant negative Fgfr1 to the cortical primordium resulted in decreased generation and lower numbers of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, which form the primary scaffold of the cortex, and cortical atrophy (Shin et al., 2004). <br><br>In the evolution of this research, Vaccarino and her colleagues discovered that FGF receptors play an indirect but crucial role in the development of inhibitory neurons. A lower number of inhibitory neurons containing parvalbumin was observed in the adult cerebral cortex of both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 null mutant mice (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Recent data suggest that the GABA neuron defect is attributable to their deficient maturation or survival during early postnatal development. Further, the stereotypic locomotor hyperactivity exhibited by FGF receptor mutant mice was inversely proportional to the number of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in their cerebral cortex (Muller Smith et al., 2008). Interestingly, parallel work in postmortem human brains performed by the same lab showed that the same parvalbumin inhibitory neurons are decreased in number within the caudate nucleus of patients with Tourette syndrome (Kalanithi et al., 2005). It is also known that cortical parvalbumin neurons are decreased in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The lab is now focused on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control parvalbumin neuron differentiation and survival throughout early postnatal development. These processes may require paracrine astroglia-neuron signaling, which requires FGF receptors. <br><br>Another idea that has been put forward by the Vaccarino laboratory is that cortical neurogenesis does not abruptly stop at birth but that the immature brain has the capacity to produce new cortical neurons, a process that is enhanced by injury. The lab has observed that after neonatal hypoxia, the excitatory neuron losses spontaneously recover in the cerebral cortex (Fagel et al., 2006, and Fagel et al., 2009). During this phase there is a prominent increase in cell proliferation and neurogenesis, along with an increase in expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 in the forebrain germinal zones (Ganat et al, 2002). The proliferation, neurogenesis and ensuing neuronal recovery are both nearly absent in Fgfr1 conditional null mutant mice.&nbsp; This represents the first evidence that excitatory neurons can recover after a postnatal insult and that FGFR1 in astroglial cells is centrally involved in this process (Fagel et al, 2009). <br><br>To further study the role of glial stem/progenitor cells in regenerative processes, the lab has generated the GFAP-CreERT2 transgenic line, in which the Cre recombinase can be transiently induced by a drug injection in astroglial cells (Ganat et al, 2006). This mouse model allows investigators to identify and follow astroglial cells and their progeny. These cells can be also genetically altered in a temporally controlled manner.&nbsp; In recognition of this work, the laboratory was recently awarded a grant from the State of Connecticut to study the gene expression and fate potential of astroglial cells after hypoxic insult. <br>Studies are underway to reveal the mechanisms and pathways that are involved in brain adaptation and self-repair after this insult. Parallel experiments will elucidate astroglia-specific transcripts that allow these cells to undergo dramatic fate transition from quiescent to reactive/proliferative, and from glial to neuron.&nbsp; <br><br>The Vaccarino research has contributed key insights into the processes that regulate the number and differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in both prenatal and postnatal development. They have proposed that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex and connected regions is regulated by developmental genes (i.e., Fgf) as well as by environmental factors (i.e., hypoxia) acting at crucial stages in development. Disruption of this delicate balance produces predictable alterations in psychomotor behavior in our animal models. These animal models mimic aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., hyperactivity, impulsivity, poor learning) and can be used to study ways to repair or reverse these deficits. The cerebral cortex and connected regions engage patterns of goal-directed behavior that are assembled during infancy. Concomitantly, the cortex represses impulsive, unwanted behaviors. Poor organization and control of cognitive and motor processes due to disrupted cortical development may be shared in various ways by schizophrenia, autism, ADHD and Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrome. &nbsp;</p>'

This is also the focus of the research in my lab. The lab consists of a group of theorists, who use mathematical modeling to understand complex adaptations, and a group of molecular and developmental biologists, using comparative sequencing and transgenic techniques to understand the evolution of developmental control genes. The emphasis of the molecular group is on the molecular evolution of Hox genes and their role in the origin and early evolution of tetrapod limbs. Tetrapod limbs are both an important complex adaptation of terrestrial vertebrates and as well as one of the best known developmental model systems from vertebrates. The focus of our mathematical work is on the dynamics of complex adaptations and the evolution of the so-called genotype-phenotype map, i.e. the way how genetic changes relate to phenotypic changes. This requires us to develop new modeling techniques, like the theory of recombination landscapes and the modeling of gene interactions. Another goal is to understand the mechanisms causing the evolution of a modular representation of the phenotype.</p><p>Research in our laboratory focuses on bone biology with particular emphasis on the fusion mechanism of macrophages, hence the differentiation of osteoclasts and giant cells, and on the targeted formation of new bone.

This polarity is crucial for the physiologic functions of epithelia. In development and during wound healing, epithelial cells can switch to a non-polarized, migratory phenotype. Disruptions in the control of cell polarity have been found to promote carcinogenesis. We study membrane polarity and proliferation in gastrointestinal epithelia.

S"<p>My research program focuses on the application of molecular techniques to the study of neurological diseases, especially spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathic pain. We are interested in understanding the molecular basis for functional recovery after CNS injury. Our studies on ion channels in impulse conduction in normal, demyelinated, and regenerating nerve fibers use molecular biological, immunoultrastructural, pharmacological, and patch-clamp techniques. We are also investigating the modification of conduction properties by pharmacologically altering ion channel characteristics, an approach that has led to clinical studies in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Using familial erythromelalgia, a human pain syndrome as a model system, we are studying the role of sodium channels in the regulation of excitability of pain-signaling sensory neurons. We hope that our work will lead to new therapies not only for erythromelalgia but also for multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and related disorders.</p><p>My laboratory focuses on functional recovery in diseases of the brain and spinal cord. In particular, we use a spectrum of methods including molecular biology and genetics, cell biology, electrophysiology, computer simulations, molecular modeling etc. to understand how the nervous system responds to injury, and how we can induce functional recovery. Approaching these issues from a molecule- and mechanism-driven standpoint, we have a special interest in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathic pain. Our early studies demonstrated the molecular basis for remissions in MS. We have a major interest in the role of ion channels in diseases of the brain and spinal cord. We have demonstrated, for example, that following injury to their axons, spinal sensory neurons turn off some sodium channel genes, while turning others on. This results in the production of different types of sodium channels (with different kinetics and voltage-dependencies) in these neurons, causing them to become hyperexcitability and thereby contributing to neuropathic pain. <br><br>We are also interested in hereditary neuropathic pain and have delineated, for the first time, the molecular basis for a hereditary pain syndrome (inherited erythromelalgia; OMIM #133020;#603415). My laboratory is also examining the role of abnormal sodium channel expression in spinal cord injury (SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Specific projects focus on molecular mechanisms of recovery of conduction along demyelinated axons, and on molecular substrates of axonal degeneration. We are also studying neuroprotection, and have demonstrated that it is possible to pharmacologically protect axons, so they don't degenerate in SCI and MS.</p>"

S'<p><span style="line-height: 21px;" class="style_1">Limbs have played acrucial role in animal evolution. The adaptive evolution of vertebratesto aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments involved theacquisition and modification of their limbs. Over the past severaldecades, labs studying limb development in the mouse and chicken haveidentified a number of important signaling centers in the limb as wellas several key molecules required for patterning the limb. Despitethese advances, there are gaps in our understanding of how a limb isbuilt. There is much to learn about the early stages of limbdevelopment and the identification of new genes required for limbgrowth and patterning is needed. We use mice to fill in some of thesegaps by exploring limb formation, patterning and growth. </span></p><p>Limbs have played a crucial role in animal evolution. The evolution of wings is recognized as the key innovationbehind the evolutionary success of the insects, while the adaptive evolution ofvertebrates to aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments involved theacquisition and modification of their limbs.&nbsp; My interests in the establishment, patterning anddevelopment of limbs have led me to work in both arthropods and chordates. &nbsp;<br><br><em>Graduateresearch</em>: As agraduate student with Sean Carroll at the Universityof Wisconsin, Madison, I investigated the regulatory networks governedby the Homeotic (Hox) genes that control the differentiation of seriallyhomologous structures within an individual species and the divergence ofhomologs between species. I utilized the insect wing (in the fruitfly Drosophilamelanogaster andthe butterfly Precis coenia) as a model system to gain a fundamentalunderstanding of how the Hox class of transcription factors controlled theplacement and morphology of insect flight appendages and how this regulationmight have changed over the course of evolution. We initially set out to betterdefine the role of Hox genes in regulating wing number.&nbsp; I discovered that no Hox genes wererequired to promote wing development, in Drosophila contrasting with previous notions,but instead that Hox genes in wingless segments repress wing development.&nbsp; <br><br>I further examined Hox gene expressionin a primitive wingless insect and discovered that the domains of Ultrabithorax(Ubx) and Abdominal-A (Abd-A) were largely similar to those in Drosophila. As wing-like protrusions firstappear on all segments in fossil insects, this suggests that Hox genes acquiredtheir wing-repressive role over the course of insect wing evolution.&nbsp; I went on to show that in addition toits wing-repressive ability in the abdomen, Ubx regulates the identity of the D.melanogasterhindwing (haltere) by acting independently on selected subsets of genesdownstream of the global wing organizing signals and at multiple levels of thewing developmental patterning hierarchy. Further, using a unique strain of P.coenia, whichdisplayed homeotic transformations on their hindwings, I showed that Ubxregulates a different set of target genes in butterflies compared to fruitflies.&nbsp; Together, these studieshave led to a deeper understanding of how the Hox genes control and diversifybody plans and of their role in the evolution of body parts and patterns.&nbsp;<br><br><em>&nbsp;Postdoctoralresearch</em>: As apostdoctoral fellow, I examined the genetic and molecular mechanisms thatregulate patterning and morphogenesis of the mammalian limb. I worked with Drs.Lee Niswander and Kathryn Anderson at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Part of my work focused on a gene, Lrp4 that is required for limb patterning. Ihave studied how Lrp4 acts in the limb in conjunction with other developmentalpathways to specify the AER and have explored how this gene ties into knowndevelopmental genetic pathways.&nbsp; Inthe course of these studies, I found that Lrp4 is required for a variety ofdifferent developmental processes, including formation of the neuromuscularjunction. In parallel studies, I also studied how homologous limbs diverge indifferent mammalian lineages by comparing the mechanisms of limb patterningbetween the mouse and the bat. &nbsp;Lrp4 is a critical factorfor limb patterning and developmentIidentified Lrp4 as a gene mutated in 2 mouse lines derived from a forwardgenetics screen. Lrp4 is required at the early limb bud stage (E9.5), a timewhen the AER is first formed.&nbsp; Inthe absence of Lrp4 function, the AER cells fail to compact at thedorsal-ventral interface of the limb; the result is a broadened AER at thedistal edge of the limb with cells that lack their characteristic columnarshape.&nbsp; As the AER is a crucial organizerof limb outgrowth, disruptions in its morphogenesis can explain most of thesubsequent defects in limb development in Lrp4 mutants. Based on homology, Lrp4is most closely related to Lrp5 and Lrp6, which are required for canonical Wntsignaling, however I tested the hypothesis that Lrp4 affects Wnt signaling andconcluded that this is not the case in the early limb. Lrp4 is expressed in acomplex pattern during development, including the teeth, kidneys, mammary budsand vibrissae, and that mutants show defects in each of the tissues where thegene is expressed.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;Divergence of vertebratelimb morphology: how the bat got its wingsI havecontinued my interest in the morphological diversification of homologousstructures by studying the bat wing. The evolution of bat wing membranes andpowered flight must have depended on mechanisms to retain and elaborateinterdigit tissue. I identified a novel mechanismutilized in the bat wing to prevent apoptosis and interdigital regressioninvolving a unique domain of Fgf8 expression in bat forelimb interdigits. Inaddition, high expression levels of the potent Bmp inhibitor Gremlin is foundin bat forelimb interdigits but not in the un-webbed hindlimbs. By growing batlimbs in culture and experimentally manipulating these signals, I found thatthe combined action of increased Bmp and decreased Fgf signaling results inextensive forelimb interdigital apoptosis. Thus it appears that in the batwing, inhibition of Bmp and activation of Fgf signaling cooperate to preventinterdigital cell death.&nbsp; Thesedata indicate that although there is not a conserved mechanism for maintaininginterdigit tissue across amniotes. In the bat, the expression in the batforelimb interdigits of Gremlin and Fgf8 suggests that these key molecularchanges underlie the evolution of the bat wing membrane.<em>&nbsp;<br><br>Ongoingand future research</em>:&nbsp; Characterization ofadditional genes affecting limb morphologyFrom asubsequent round of mutagenesis screening in Dr. Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s lab, I identified 3additional mutant lines that display abnormal limb patterning andmorphogenesis, as well as defects in other organs.&nbsp; We are continuing to work on these lines to identify theaffected gene and determine the roles of these genes in limb and organdevelopment.&nbsp;Lrp4 and Shd, two genes that control formationof the AERThe AERplays a pivotal role in limb development through its signaling interactionswith limb bud mesenchyme. Despite recent advances in defining some of the majorgenes necessary to form a limb, our understanding of how the AER is establishedand refined through the migration and compaction of Fgf8-expressing cells isnot understood.&nbsp; I am currentlyworking with two mutant lines, Lrp4 and a new mutant line, shorthand (shd), that show dorsal-ventral expansionof the AER during early limb development to examine the early steps of AERmorphogenesis and AER maintenance.&nbsp;While therole of Lrp4 in limb development is unresolved, the early expansion of the AERsuggests that Lrp4 is critical for determining the number of cells adopting anAER fate and also for setting the boundaries of the AER. My in vivo studies demonstrate expansion ofboth Fgf and Bmp signaling in the early Lrp4 mutant limbs.&nbsp; As both of these signaling pathwayscontribute to AER formation and Fgf8 expression in the early limb, theexpansion of either could underlie the broadening of the AER in Lrp4 mutants.<br><br>Our preliminary experiments in Xenopus (in collaboration with Dr. Xi He\xe2\x80\x99slaboratory) do not corroborate this.&nbsp;Dorsal injection of Lrp4 mRNA does not inhibit Wnt-mediated dorsal axisspecification and co-injection of Lrp4 and Wnt8 did not inhibit activation ofthe Wnt-target Xnr3.&nbsp; Thus, furtherstudy is required to determine the signaling pathway(s) affected by Lrp4.&nbsp;Theexpanded AER phenotype in line shd occurs slightly later than Lrp4 mutants, suggesting thatmaintenance of the normal boundaries of the AER is disrupted in shd mutants.&nbsp; Exploration of this phenotype will shed light on the factorsrequired for maintenance of a discreet border between AER and limb ectoderm.Line shd hasbeen mapped to a gene-dense genomic interval and should be cloned shortly. Howthe early signaling pathways, including Bmps and Wnts converge on Fgf8 in theearly limb and what factors regulate the morphology of AER are not understood.In my laboratory, I will use genetic interaction experiments between Lrp4, shd,Wnt and Bmp pathway components and their inhibitors to define the role of thesegenes in establishing normal number of cells in the AER, and setting itsborders and directing AER morphogenesis.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We arecontinuing to work with these mutants to better define how Lrp4 and shdregulate the AER.<br><br><span>In terms ofhuman relevance, one of the most common types of birth defects isdeformation of the limbs.&nbsp; However, little is known about thedevelopmental, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying thesedefects. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that pattern limbswill lead to a better understanding of the possible causes of humanlimb defects.</span></p>'

S'<p><span>We study how noncoding RNA molecules fold into intricate structures, how cells recognize and degrade misfolded, defective and damaged noncoding RNAs, and the consequences of RNA damage for cell physiology and disease. One protein under study, called Ro, is part of a novel RNA quality control pathway in both mammalian cells and bacteria. Ro is ring-shaped and binds the ends of misfolded noncoding RNAs in its central cavity, targeting these RNAs for decay. Interestingly, binding of misfolded noncoding RNAs to Ro is itself regulated by noncoding RNAs called Y RNAs. As mice lacking Ro develop an autoimmune disease that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus, Ro may be important for preventing autoimmunity. In a second effort, we are identifying other components involved in recognizing and degrading damaged RNAs in mammalian cells. Our experiments utilize a wide variety of techniques, including mouse and bacterial genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and cell imaging.</span><P><span></span></P></p><p><p>Our laboratory studies how cells recognize and degrade aberrant, damaged, unneeded and potentially harmful noncoding RNAs. Most cellular RNA does not code for proteins, and truncated, misfolded and aberrant noncoding RNAs can accumulate as a result of mutations, transcriptional errors and processing mistakes. Also, as retrotransposon-derived sequences make up much of mammalian genomes, the transcripts from these elements may need to be recognized and degraded. Finally, certain types of environmental stress, such as exposure to oxidants and ultraviolet light, can result in RNA damage. &nbsp;One pathway that we study involves a protein called the Ro 60 kDa autoantigen. Ro was discovered because it is a major target of the immune system in patients with the rheumatic diseases systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome. &nbsp;Ro is present in many animal cells and also in ~5% of sequenced bacterial genomes. In both mammalian cells and bacteria, Ro is important for survival after UV irradiation. &nbsp;Ro is shaped like a donut with a central hole and binds the ends of misfolded and defective RNAs inside its central cavity. &nbsp;As mice lacking Ro develop an autoimmune disease that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus, Ro may be important for preventing autoimmunity.</p>'

Chemoattractants, including chemokines, play an important role in host defense. However, their unchecked activities contribute to may inflammation-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, tumorigenesis, and various allergies. The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins participates in a wide variety of developmental events including, control of cell growth, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. Wnt pathways have been also closely linked to tumorigenesis, glucose metabolism, and bone formation. We are using a combination of molecular and cell biological, biochemical, chemical biological, transgenic, functional genomic, and proteomic approaches to discover novel signaling mechanisms and functions for these signaling proteins.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis and function of signal transduction pathways, with the emphasis on those initiated by seven-transmembrane receptors. These receptors can be divided into two groups: one couples to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins; and the other binds to ligands including hedgehog proteins and Wnt proteins. Currently, we are focusing on chemoattractant and Wnt-activated signaling.Chemoattractants, including the superfamily of chemotactic cytokines, chemokines, play an important role in host defense by attracting and activating leukocytes at sites of injury and infection. However, their unchecked activities contribute to may inflammation-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, tumorigenesis, and various allergies. Work in my lab has made significant contributions to the understanding of signaling mechanisms and functions of a number of chemoattractant-activated pathways. These include pathways linked by PLC \xc3\x9f, PI3K?, PIXa/Pak/Cdc42, PTEN, P-Rex1, and Myo1f. We are continuing to use a combination of molecular and cell biological, biochemical, transgenic, functional genomic, and proteomic approaches to characterize novel chemoattractant signaling mechanisms and study their functions in cell migration and inflammation-related paradigms.The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins participates in a wide variety of developmental events including, control of cell growth, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. Wnt pathways have been also closely linked to tumorigenesis and bone formation. Most notable contributions from my is the discovery of the interaction between Wnt coreceptor LRP-5 and Axin, which provides the first connection from a Wnt receptor to a intracellular signaling component and the characterization of the role of Dkk2 in regulation of osteogenic differentiation. We are continuing to work on the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of Wnt signaling and characterization of their role in pathophysiological processes, including osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and tumorigenesis, using computation-based virtual screening and chemical genomic approaches, in addition to the aforementioned ones.</p>'

Aberrations ofepigenetic regulation often lead to cancer and other human diseases.Our laboratory is interested in epigenetic regulation by histonedemethylases in cancer and stem cells. In particular, we focus on theroles and regulatory mechanisms of histone demethylases for tri-methylated lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3), the epigenetic mark fortranscriptionally active chromatin. We have previously showed RBP2 isone of the first known histone demethylases for H3K4me3 and generated aknockout mouse model. We are currently studying how this enzymecontributes to oncogenesis using a combination of biochemical, molecular biological,cell biological and mouse genetic approaches. We are also investigatingthe roles of another H3K4me3 histone demethylase PLU-1. Our currentdata suggest these enzymes are potential drug targets for epigenetictherapies against cancer.</p><p>Metastasis is the major cause of mortality for cancer patients.Given that alterations causing metastasis are late events and thatmultiple genetic alterations occur in late stage cancers, traditionalapproaches have not been fruitful in identifying genes involved inmetastasis. We have performed a genome-wide genetic screen formutations promoting tumor progression and metastasis in Drosophila andhave identified mutations in more than 50 genes. We have found thatapicobasal polarity mutations in collaboration with oncogenic Rasmutation produce fly tumors with a full spectrum of metastaticphenotypes observed in human malignant cancers. Mutation of cellpolarity genes activates JNK signaling and down-regulates theE-cadherin/b-catenin adhesion complex. Furthermore, JNK and Rassignaling cooperate in promoting tumor growth. The concept thattumor-initiating alterations contribute to the development ofmetastasis, provides an explanation why tumors of distinguish originshave vast different metastatic potential.<br><br>Our work has also revealedthat tumor cells hijack normal invasive developmental process toachieve progression. Elements of the invasion machinery, includingJNK-induced MMP expression, are shared by both developmental and tumorinvasion processes. Preventing BM degradation completely blocks bothtissue and tumor invasion, indicating that modulation of BM isessential for invasion. The pathways regulate invasion duringdevelopment and tumor progression are excellent targets for cancertherapy.Our work on tumor growth have shown that tumor suppressors such asTSC, PTEN, and LATS regulate tissue and organism size duringdevelopment and propose that deregulation of size-control mechanisms isessential for tumorigenesis. We have showed that TSC and PTEN genesfunction in the PI3K/Akt pathway and reduction of S6K activitylevitates TSC defects. These findings have helped to define one of themajor cancer pathways in humans and have lead to clinical trials forTSC and LAM diseases.One of our long term goal is to develop methodologies in mammals forinterrogating the genome by forward genetics. We have successfullyadapted the piggyBac transposon for transgenesis and insertionalmutagenesis in mammals. This has led to the development of a highlyefficient single transposon mutagenesis strategy and to thenear-production of the first set of genome-wide insertional mutants inmice, which will provide an unprecedented opportunity for decipheringmammalian biology and disease.</p>'

We have recently demonstrated the sequestration of TAF3 (a non-canonical TFIID subunit) away from the nuclear periphery, its functional relevance to MyoD gene transcription and its connection to chromatin recognition (Yao et al, Genes and Dev., 2011). We are interested in: 1) Characterizing additional proteins demonstrating sub-nuclear compartmentalization and studying its molecular basis; 2) Identifying DNA elements sequestered at the nuclear periphery at a global scale; 3) Investigating the functional consequences of these sub-nuclear compartmentalizations.\t <br><br>Understanding the nuclear architecture ultimately requires identifying individual genes and proteins at the single molecule level.

More specifically, we are interested in the cellular and molecular properties of individual neurons in neural regions involved in long-term memory (hippocampus) and working memory (prefrontal cortex). Because memory function depends on the spatial and temporal firing patterns of interconnected populations of neurons, we use electrophysiological and live fluorescence imaging techniques to examine factors that determine whether an individual neuron in a \xe2\x80\x9cmemory circuit\xe2\x80\x9d fires an action potential. <br><br>These factors include the state-dependent biophysical and cellular properties of the neurons, the spatial and temporal pattern of synaptic activation, the ability of neuronal dendrites to integrate convergent synaptic input, and the ability of synapses to change their synaptic strength such that occurs with LTP and LTD.</p><p>We also study the role of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in memory-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and aging. Another line of our research examines inhibitory synaptic transmission between connected pairs of medium spiny neurons in the neostriatum. In this project we are investigating the hypothesis that dopaminergic regulation of GABAergic inhibition regulates the balance of activity between the two output pathways of the neostriatum. We use a variety of techniques to examine these issues, including: electrophysiological recordings, high-speed and high-resolution fluorescence imaging, molecular biology, immunohistochemistry, and compartmental modeling.</p>"

We effortlessly demonstrate enormous flexibility and generality, which hides its staggering complexity: more than one-third of the primate brain processes visual information. How do we characterize the function of billions of neurons in algorithmic terms? Steven Zucker is putting the requirements of vision systems together with insights from neurophysiology to develop an abstract theory of computational vision. Based on differential geometry, it leads to methods of curve detection, shading and texture analyses, and generic shape description. The key to studying and modeling vision is an interdisciplinary perspective, integrating computation, neuroscience, and mathematics.</p><p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a family of integral membrane proteins that mediate the diffusion of cations, primarily Ca2+, across the cell membrane. Many of these channels perform critical roles in the transduction of sensation: they open and close in response to signals such as light, temperature, mechanical stimuli and certain chemicals, thus generating electrochemical signals that ultimately lead to the transmission of sensory information. Currently, more than 30 members of this family have been cloned, widely distributed over a range of eukaryotic cell types.<br><br>&nbsp;Although significant progress has been made in the functional study of these channels, we know almost nothing about their structures. Without structural information, it is difficult to ascertain how a channel might open or close in response to its specific stimulus (i.e. the gating mechanism), or how ions pass through the channel pore once the gate is open (the permeation mechanism). Our laboratory investigates the gating and permeation mechanisms of TRP channels by applying techniques from x-ray crystallography, biochemistry, and electron microscopy to the study of channel structure and function.</p>'
