The main goals of his lab's research are to understand how the visual neural architecture is matched to the image and how it samples, codes and processes the different features of the image; and to identify the attributes of natural images that are most critical for coding in the visual system. Questions his research asks are: What are the significant correlations and functional relations among the different image features? How do critical parameters such as contrast in time, space and color and local and global details affect visual image processing? How does visual processing match and adapt to dynamic changes in the image? How does the visual system extract image features such as spatial detail and color? To investigate these questions, they apply quantitative analysis and simulation methods from image processing and neural networks that are rigorously based on known anatomy and physiology and explore the design principles and strategy underlying the visual system neural architecture."

S"Architecture and Compilers | Spatial Computing | Microelectronics   Andre's nano-research strives to answer questions of how to build computing systems at the atomic scale, where device assembly is imperfect, and device operation is statistical in nature. Andre is concerned with effective nanoscale design, which requires a rethinking of computer organization, including conventional abstraction layers. In his work, Andre and his colleagues explore how to harness emerging nanoscale building blocks, such as nanowires, CNTs, and molecules for computation, and how to address the physical challenges they present, including high defect and fault rates, parameter variation, lifetime variability, and statistical assembly."

In the area of molecular simulations of gas adsorption, he applies molecular models and computer simulation techniques to investigate how the microstructure of a porous material affects its physical and chemical properties and, especially, its capacity as an adsorbent. The goal is to offer guidance in the preparation of high-capacity adsorbents. In the area of polymer adsorption, he works on statistical mechanical models to examine the adsorption of large flexible molecules from a bulk fluid into the interior of a porous solid.  This research is based on PRISM, a state-of-the-art theory of polymer structure, which has been successfully used to calculate the structure of melts and blends. Recent improvements include a tractable self-consistent version applicable to a wide range of systems. In his research dealing with barriers to mass transfer in catalysts and adsorbents, Eduardo looks at the important rate separations based on the kinetics of mass transfer within materials such as zeolites and carbon molecular sieves. Current work is focused on multicomponent systems and on the modeling of industrially relevant adsorbents."

This has included separation and cell growth systems with magnetically stabilized beds, non-uniform field electrophoresis, immobilized enzyme reaction systems, artificial photosynthesis, affinity chromatography, cell adhesion to surfaces, plant cell culture systems, and most recently analysis and optimization of DNA microarray processes. Of particular interest are his examinations of several novel ways to recover such bioproducts selectively and continuously from fermentation broths or broken cell suspensions. One of the most promising techniques involves continuous adsorption in an unusual device called the magnetically stabilized fluidized bed (MSFB). The MSFB has significant advantages in productivity, simplicity, and freedom from clogging by debris over standard packed bed systems, and it can be much more efficient than fluidized systems. Although biochemical engineers have dealt successfully with bacterial and fungal cell cultures for many years, recent scientific work has shown that important products can be obtained from cultures of mammalian and plant cells. Thus, the unique engineering aspects of such delicate and complex systems are of great current interest."

In the examination of ErbB receptors (e.g., EGFR, HER2), Matt looks at their signal transduction role in health, and how they are also implicated in multiple human cancers and constitute prime targets for anti-cancer therapeutics. His work in this area entails a systems approach for elucidating how ErbB trafficking and signaling influence cell fates in the presence of different stimulatory factors and molecular therapeutics. In studying cell signaling in the renal proximal tubule, he seeks to develop a detailed understanding of the coupling between fluid mechanical and mass transfer phenomena in the glomerulus and proximal tubule and consequent cell signaling and cellular fates in the proximal epithelium. Elevated excreted albumin concentration is a classical indicator of renal dysfunction, and it is increasingly appreciated as a potential mediator of renal disease as well."

S"Biomechanics | Cell Mechanics | Tissue Engineering   Cells within the body routinely tolerate deformations during activities such as head turning and breathing, yet when cells are deformed beyond a safe limit or injury threshold, function and structure are altered temporarily or even permanently. The goal of the Injury Biomechanics Lab is to determine functional and structural injury thresholds in the brain and lung, and use them to understand mechanisms of traumatic brain and lung injury. In addition, the lab's study of the biochemical and molecular biology of injured cells facilitates the development of preventive and therapeutic measures. Because human tissues tend to be inhomogeneous, anisotropic and nonlinear, and the tissues of interest undergo large strains, determining the complex relationship between cellular and macroscopic responses requires an integrated biomechanics approach consisting of several simultaneous rigorous engineering experimental and theoretical analyses. Tissue mechanical properties and injury thresholds are measured and used to develop computational models. These models are used to generalize our experimental cell and tissue findings and determine macroscopic injury mechanisms. Applications of current work are in the areas of traumatic head injury in adults and children, and ventilator-induced lung injury. These studies parallel clinical investigations regarding the treatment and detection of traumatic injury. Margulies' research program is currently funded by NIH and CDC. She has served or is on the editorial boards of the Journal of Physiology, the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, the Journal of Biomechanics, and the Journal of Neurotrauma; she has served on grant review panels for NSF, NIH, and CDC, and is chair of the NIH RIBT study section. Her work has been featured in The New York Times, Forbes, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Discover Magazine, and by CNN and the BBC.

S"Cellular Engineering | Neuroengineering (molecular ) | Neurobiology   Dave's research focuses on understanding the mechanical cues that regulate injury, repair, and growth in cells and tissues of the central nervous system. The process of mechanotransduction is critical in understanding the response of cells and tissues of the central nervous system (CNS) to traumatic injury. In this research area, experimental work is combined with mathematical modeling to provide a method to quantify the effect of physical forces on cell and tissue function. For example, some of the research combines finite element models of the brain with experimental work to estimate the tissue mechanical stress/strain associated with biological markers of injury. These models provide a starting point to relate traditional measures of stress to the microstructural constituents of the tissue. Structural models are being developed to link global mechanical deformations and the resulting deformation of cellular/subcellular microstructures in the CNS white matter. With the kinematic transformations between the macroscopic deformations and cellular components of the CNS  white matter now better established, the research has expanded to determine the mechanism(s) by which a mechanical signal is converted into a biochemical signaling cascade for organotypic tissue, cultured neurons, and cultured axons. Clinical applications of his work include developing new testing standards to improve the safety of headgear and automotive restraint systems, and testing new techniques for repairing damaged tissues in the brain after injury."

S"Computational Mechanics | Mechanics of Materials | Nanomechanics   Professor Ponte's research is in the areas of nonlinear composite materials, microstructure evolution and localization in manufacturing processes, low-symmetry polycrystals, and thermoplastic elastomers. In the area of nonlinear composite materials, Pedro addresses nonlinear constitutive and kinematical effects as observed in low-temperature plasticity and high-temperature creep of metal-matrix composites, as well as in the large-deformation behavior of black-filled and porous elastomers. In microstructure evolution and localization in manufacturing processes, his lab is concerned with the theoretical development of constitutive models for porous materials, accounting for the evolution of the microstructure, which will be useful in assessing the effect of porosity on localization. He is developing constitutive models for low-symmetry polycrystals, and on the numerical implementation of these models in constitutive subroutines. In his examination of thermoplastic elastomers, Professor Ponte's lab is developing structure-property relations for styrenic thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). These are multiphase polymeric materials which consist of a phase (e.g., polybutadiene) giving rise to the rubbery nature of the materials, and a crystalline or glassy phase (e.g., polystyrene) yielding increased stiffness and enhanced large-deformation properties. TPEs exhibit structure a two different length scales and there is growing experimental evidence that this dual structure greatly affects the overall response of macroscopic samples. He is also developing constitutive models for magneto-elastic materials capable of undergoing large strains and investigating possible applications as active materials."

S"Mechanics of Materials | Nanostructured Materials | Material Interfaces   Dave's research projects include study of deformation and fracture of intermetallic compounds. The ductility of most intermetallics is quite low due either to grain boundary or cleavage failure. His lab is investigating the deformation and fracture mechanisms in a number of singlecrystalline intermetallics, including V2Hf, Cr3Si, and Al3Ti. The strength of metal-ceramic interfaces is very important in many material systems, such as electronic packages, composite materials, and high temperature fracture of metals (in which creep voids usually nucleate on second-phase ceramic particles). In this area he is studying the strength of Fe-Al2O3 interfaces as controlled by impurities which segregate to the interface, such as S, C, P, and B. The fracture path in many polycrystalline materials follows the grain boundaries, i.e. in Ni3Al and in certain iron-base alloys with impurities. Since the structure of these boundaries varies with crystallographic misorientation across the boundary and with the orientation of the boundary plane, the strengths of the boundaries are also expected to vary. His group is studying the relative strengths of boundaries using the coincidence site lattice model to describe the boundaries. They have found that high coincidence boundaries (low sigma) are not stronger than random boundaries, but twin boundaries and low angle boundaries are substantially stronger."

In the end, the goal will be wireless networks that provide the same seamless connectivity we experience in our homes and offices.'

By combining biomechanical and immunological techniques, her lab can define the relationships between injury to the cervical spine/neck and physiological cascades of persistent pain. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding injury to individual structures in the neck, such as the facet joints, nerve roots and spinal cord and how mechanical loading to these structures elicits pain. Through this work she can begin to develop thresholds for mechanical injury that produce persistent pain; and work towards a definition of the neck's tolerance for painful injury. Additional research efforts are aimed at understanding the role of biomechanics in the neuroimmunologic changes of the central nervous system that contribute to persistent pain. Applications of her current work are in the areas of automotive and whiplash-related injury and sports injuries and have implications for design efforts in automobiles that are aimed at preventing whiplash injuries."
