S"I am continuing work on my first book, which will be a monograph developing ideas started in my dissertation. This book, titled <i>The Succor of Horror: Sacrifice, Violence, and Trauma in the Early Middle Ages</i>, will examine how medieval narratives are animated, structured, and disrupted by scenes of sacrificial and traumatic violence. In my introduction, I begin by defining key concepts that inform my work, and that have become watchwords of sorts in literary criticism: trauma, affect, mourning, melancholy, memory, nostalgia, and sacrifice. Although aspects of this ground have been covered before, the application of these interpretive models to medieval texts remains a work in progress, and I hope that my book will further the discussion. In addition, my work continues the important work of Dominick Lacapra, who has interrogated the connections between sublimity and violent sacrifice found in many artistic and cultural poses. <br /><br />My second planned monograph, tentatively titled <i>Bad Immanence</i>, will examine the concept of immanence through the literary critical models of E.R. Curtius, Walter Benjamin, Gilles Deleuze, and others. Specifically, I begin with Curtius' conception of <i>Toposforschung</i> as a heuristic model whose philological labors would assist in forming an informed notion of history that would reveal 'new structures of the mind.' Both Benjamin and Deleuze are theorists whose work, while very different in focus from Curtius' own, nevertheless offers new insights to the contemporary meaning of immanence from a literary and historical perspective. I also expect the work will be informed by the writings on aesthetics of Hans Urs von Balthasar. Chapters will compare medieval writings to modern successors, such as the mystical writings of Jakob B&#246;hme to the work of Cormac McCarthy; medieval writings on angelology, and the writing of Harold Brodkey; fourteenth-century English writing, Albert Murray, blues violence and minority epic; the efforts of poets such as Geoffrey Hill and Seamus Heaney to forge a connection with the medieval past through meditations on history and landscape; and the various associations between popular medievalism, literary decadence, and melancholy.<br /><br />Recent Conference Papers and Invited Lectures<br />'Traumatized Objects in Anglo-Saxon England', invited lecture, University of Connecticut at Storrs, January 2011<br />'The Succor of Horror: Finding Pleasure in Pain in the Middle Ages', Invited conference speaker, Dancing with Death: Warfare, Wounds, and Disease in the Middle Ages, California University of Pennsylvania, October 2010<br />'The Scars that Won't Heal Your Eyes: Scapegoat and Sacrifice in the Old English <i>Daniel</i>', 45th International Medieval Congress, Western Michigan University, May 2010<br />'The Sacrifice of History and the Succor of Horror', invited lecture, Brown University, Medieval Circle of Rhode Island, October 2009<br />'Falling Bodies and the Traumatic Gesture in Margery Kempe and Kafka', American Comparative Literature Association Conference, Harvard University, March 2009<br />'The Memory of <i>Karolus Magnus</i> and the Question of Power and Privilege in Late Medieval England', Haskins Society 27th International Conference, Georgetown University, November 2008<br />'The Outlaw's Fatal Embrace: Viewing the <i>Pardoner's Tale</i> through the Lens of John Ford's <i>The Searchers</i>', 39th Convention, Northeast Modern Language Association, April 2008<br />'Deferred Sacrifice and Chivalric Cenotaphs: Malory's <i>Morte Darthur</i>, Books VII and VIII', 15th Biennial New College Conference on Medieval and Renaissance Studies, March 2008<br />'<i>Discors machina</i>: Gruesome Violence and Chaos in Carolingian Poetry of War', Beholding Violence: A Conference on Medieval and Early Modern Representation and Culture, Bowling Green State University, February 2008"

S"Anthony Adams is Visiting Assistant Professor of English, specializing in medieval languages and literatures. Adams is working on his first book titled <i>The Succor of Horror: Sacrifice, Violence, and Trauma in the Early Middle Ages</i>, which examines the crucial ways that trauma and violence inform and structure early medieval literature. He has written on King Alfred's prayerbook, Old English and Carolingian poetry of war, Medieval Latin, Thomas Malory, the Middle English Charlemagne romances, the <i>Pardoner's Tale</i>, and <i>Beowulf</i>, and published (with A. G. Rigg) the first complete English translation of the ninth-century epic poem <i>Bella Parisiacae urbis</i> in the <i>Journal for Medieval Latin</i>. Before coming to Brown, he taught at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He received his Ph.D. from the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto in 2008, with a thesis titled 'Heroic Slaughter and Versified Violence: A Reading of Sacrifice in Some Early English and Carolingian Poetry of War'. He received his B.A. in English from Wesleyan University."

S'The long-term goal of my research is to understand the role of experience in the development of neural circuits. To address this question it is necessary to first understand what mechanisms regulate and maintain the normal morphology, synaptic connectivity, excitability, and output properties of the neurons that constitute these circuits, and then observe how these mechanisms are affected by experience. Over the last few decades, research has shown that neural activity plays a critical role during the development of the visual system. However, less is known about how the visual system adapts to neural activity over a shorter time scale during development. This is important, since neurons must be able to function within a useful dynamic range when faced with changing environmental and developmental conditions. In order to do this, neurons have been shown to homeostatically adapt their synaptic and intrinsic electrophysiologically relevant conditions. By understanding how the developing nervous system responds and adjusts to periods of enhanced activity we can begin to comprehend how this activity can be maximally utilized to guide long-term developmental changes.  <br /><br />In my research I address these issues by taking advantage of the Xenopus laevis tadpole visual system. The optictectal neurons in the tadpole receive direct monosynaptic inputs from the contralateral retina, and form a developmental gradient where it is possible to study neurons at different stages of their development in the same preparation. The synaptic and dendritic maturation of tectal neurons is well characterized and provides a starting point from which to study the roles that visual experience and a variety of signaling mechanisms play in these processes. Moreover, tectal neurons are easily accessible, allowing us to take advantage of several established techniques for altering gene expression in individual neurons and then observe the effects of these genes of interest in the electrophysiological and morphological properties of these cells. <br /><br />My research has used a novel approach where freely swimming tadpoles are presented with a moving visual stimulus for a few hours. This allowed us to directly test the effects of visual experience over a relatively short timescale in a highly plastic, developing nervous system. A variety of mechanisms have emerged where tectal neurons respond to persistent visual stimulation by altering both their intrinsic excitability and their synaptic properties. We are now in a position to study these mechanisms in depth using diverse electrophysiological, imaging and molecular techniques.'

S"Engin Deniz Akarli's book project, Law in the Marketplace: Istanbul Artisans, 1730-1840, examines how the Ottoman legal system worked and where it failed in dealing with conflicts affecting urban market relations in a relatively long and critical period of Ottoman history. The project also links the tensions of the Ottoman legal system to its gradual transformation in the nineteenth century and discusses the implications of this transformation for state-society relations in the modern Middle East.  The originality and significance of the project are in the sources on which it relies and in its focus on a combination of understudied themes.<br /><br />Law has been a long-neglected theme in modern historiography of non-Western contexts, partly because habits of thought shaped by modern concepts of law and state used to make it difficult to recognize, let alone appreciate, differently conceived legal cultures and systems.  Recent debates on law, however, challenge established perceptions and encourage efforts to expand the scope of human experience on which to base our understanding of law and its place in human life.  Simultaneously, recent research on Islamic legal thought (which informed Ottoman legal practice) points to its sophistication and significance as one of the major legal traditions of human history. <br /><br />Studies on Islamic legal history, however, rely primarily on sources of a theoretical nature.  We still know little about how Islamic legal tradition informed the judiciary processes and reasoning in specific historical settings or about its perceptions by the people who relied on it to defend their interests.  One of my main objectives is to address these gaps relying on the most detailed sources available to us, namely the judiciary documents preserved in the Ottoman archives. <br /><br />Sources <br />The Ottoman kadi court records and the judicial files of the Ottoman Imperial Council (Divan) constitute by far the richest sources available to researchers interested in legal praxis in an Islamic context before the advent of the modern state and legal systems.  There is a growing interest in using the regular court records as a source of legal history, in conjunction with contemporaneous collections of legal opinions (fatawa) and legal treatises. However, the formulaic nature of the court records impedes in-depth inquiries into judiciary processes and reasoning.  The judicial files of the Divan, on the other hand, provide detailed information on the background of each case as well as on the legal evidence pertaining to it.  Only a few scholars mostly interested in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century legal history have used these files so far, although the most detailed files date from the period covered in my research.  I rely primarily on the Divan files (but also use some relevant court records and legal treatises) to shed light on the legal contexts and practices through which the meaning of law and justice was negotiated and interpreted in the Ottoman capital. <br /><br />Scope of the Work<br />The sheer volume of the Divan's judicial files necessitates the limitation of the scope of research.  I focus on the artisans and traders of the major business-districts of greater Istanbul in 1730-1840.  Artisans and traders were religiously and ethnically mixed town-dwellers.  They had differences among themselves as well as with merchants, owners of work premises, vendors, and various government offices and officials.  They turned to the legal system to defend their interests and became involved in demonstrations calling for justice when they believed the legal system had failed them.<br /><br />The period I cover begins with a major popular uprising in which Istanbul artisans and traders were actively involved.  It ends with a turning point in Ottoman history, when the adoption of a bureaucratic and legal reorganization policy began to transform the Ottoman state and society after Western models.  In between, we have a period of relative tranquility and prosperity until about 1775, then a phase of wars and economic hardship.  Observing the performance of the Ottoman legal system through the vicissitudes of this period with a focus on artisans and traders enables me to examine how it worked or failed to work through a broad range of conflictive situations that affected the marketplace and the various social groups that made up its human tapestry.<br /><br /><br />Outline of the Work<br /><br />Part I: The Legal System and the Due Legal Process: Part One describes the organization of the Ottoman legal system and the procedures with which it worked.  My main argument is that at all levels of the legal process, the Ottoman legal culture emphasized the reconciliation of real or potential differences through negotiations in light of certain broad legal principles and norms embedded in Islamic legal tradition and held to be universally relevant.  Through this process, the courts made and remade the laws, in the practical sense of the word as binding provisions, with the participation of those actors to whom the provisions would apply.  <br /><br />Part II: Property Relations: In Part Two, I illustrate the operation of the system in detail by focusing on the legal regulation of property relations over immovable urban commercial property, an issue particularly sensitive to social and economic changes in general.  I show how the complexity of these relations eventually strained the courts' capacity to reconcile differences and to accommodate change. <br /><br />Part III: Fundamental Objectives of the Law and Non-Muslim Artisans: In Part Three, I focus on tensions and cooperation among artisans and traders of the same calling but of different religious affiliation and on the courts handling of these differences.  My aim is to examine how certain universalistic norms or claims of the Ottoman-Islamic legal tradition worked in practice.  I observe that the Ottoman legal tradition served quite effectively in a complex multi-religious environment but not as equitably as the emerging modern ideals of law and citizenship promised. <br /><br />Part IV: Changes in the Reform Era and Conclusions: In this final part, I will examine the changes in legal institutions and the concept of law in the nineteenth century and the repercussions of these changes for state-society relations in the post-Ottoman Middle East.  At this point, I hold that reforms may have produced seemingly strong and stable states and, in certain cases, rule of law in the modern Middle East but not regimes that are consistently accountable to the people over which they rule.  This is a legacy of the nineteenth century, rather than the eighteenth.  Law had different meanings and objectives that were more responsive to the society and provided a greater degree of civic autonomy and initiative in the eighteenth century.  That system cannot be resurrected and would not fit our world.  Learning about the experience of the people who used and influenced it, however, may inspire reassessments of the current relations between state, society and law in the Middle East.  At the least, it should broaden the comparative and historical base of our understanding of the place of law in human life."

S"I have long been engaged in basic research designed to assess the effects of culture on various cognitive processes.  I have focused my work on aspects of African American culture with the goal of informing school reform efforts geared towards addressing the disproportionately high rate of academic failure exhibited by many African American children.  While I continue to pursue this line of research, my empirical work has led to a more general interest in race, culture and diversity, especially as they relate to education in the United States.  This expanding interest has come to greatly influence not only my scholarship, but also my teaching and higher education administration interests.<br /><br /> Influenced by the writings of the Russian psychologist L.S. Vygotsky, my research has maintained that cognitive performance is often inextricably linked to cultural contexts.  Cultural contexts provide systems of meaning that influence how individuals come to understand the world around them, and it is within these contexts that individuals develop approaches to thinking and problem solving.   In terms of education, this work suggests that the best performance occurs when the context for learning builds upon the cultural experiences of the learner.<br /><br />Like all human groups, African Americans cultivate meaning systems that are coherent and have integrity.  However, aspects of these meaning systems are mostly absent from the formal schooling experience in the United States.  According to the culture and cognition argument, such a situation may, in part, accounts for some of the educational difficulties exhibited by many African American children. Thus, I argue that one major way to enhance the academic experiences for many African American children is to devise ways for building into the schooling context constructive cultural outlets for the expression of African American cultural experiences.<br /><br />The majority of my work has pursued this issue using movement expression and communalism as the cultural factors of interest. In general this work has shown that African American children's cognitive performance is greatly enhanced when the context for learning incorporates music and the opportunity for movement as well as the opportunity to work in cooperative groups."

S'Susan M. Allen, PhD, is a sociologist and health policy researcher who studies the community-based care of people with chronic conditions and disabilities.  Her research focuses on both paid home care as well as home care provided by family members.  She has identifed factors related to unmet need for help at home, and has also identified the immediate consequences of unmet need, such as falling and inability to follow physician-prescribed diets.  Dr. Allen recently investigated the influence of unmet need for care in the home on subsequent hospitalizaiton using national survey data linked to Medicare claims data, and found that self-report of unmet need is predictive of hospitalization over a three month follow up period, thus linking the quality of home care with acute care utilization. Within the context of this same study, funded by the National Institute on Aging, she also studied the characteristics of family caregivers that are predictive of caregiving resilience over time and found that current trends in caregiving networks, e.g., an increase in the proportion of caregivers who are men and also in the proportion of caregivers who provide care without the support of secondary caregivers, are associated with caregiving transitions to nursing homes as well as to no care. Dr. Allen has also studied the use of assistive technology and home accommodations as home care resources, and found that use of mobility equipment and home accommodations can reduce levels of human help for some subgroups of the disabled population.  Dr. Allen conducts research on people with disabilities for the Rhode Island Department of Human Services, and is currently consulting on the rebalancing of Medicaid long term care to include expanded options for care in the community.<br />Dr. Allen is also interested in the psychosocial outcomes of women with cancer and is concluding an NCI study investigating phsyican practices regarding communication of the risk of infertility associated with cancer treatment among premenopausal women.  Her interest in the health and well being of younger women is a theme in her current VA study investigating the challenges women face following deployment to Iraq as they attempt to resume their social roles.'

She is also Associate Director of the Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research at Brown, and Associate Director of the VA Center on Systems, Outcomes and Quality in Chronic Disease and Rehabilitation (VA HSR&D REAP). Dr Allen has a long history of studying home care issues among people with disabilities. Her research focuses on both formal and family care, as well as technological assistance as a third home care resource. She is currently PI of a study funded by a Real Choice Systems Change grant to the RI Medicaid program to evaluate the effect of Rhode Island's efforts to expand options for community based care, including deinstitutionalization of low care nursing home residents, on the Medicaid population in RI nursing homes. She is also funded as an Investigator (Kasper and Freedman, Co-PIs)to develop measures of unmet need and other consequences of disability in the elderly population for the National Survey on Aging and Health, funded by the National Institute on Aging. Dr. Allen's second research interest is in the arena of women's health and well-being. Her work in the Veterans Administration focuses on the reintegration of female veterans following deployment to Iraq, with an emphasis on the impact of deployment stressors on the resumption of social roles.

S"Joseph F. Amaral, MD, is the president and CEO of Rhode Island Hospital and a practicing surgeon specializing in minimally invasive surgery. He is well known for introducing laparoscopic surgery to Rhode Island and New England in 1990. This type of surgery revolutionized care for patients by allowing complex operations such as gall bladder removal to be performed with small incisions, resulting in discharge from the hospital on the same or next day. Most recently, he has pioneered removal of kidneys through this means for the hospital's kidney transplant program. In addition to his role at Rhode Island Hospital, he is a Professor of Surgery at Brown Medical School and is a member of over 25 professional societies. He is the author of over 75 papers and book chapters and has given over 250 national and international presentations. Dr. Amaral was also actively involved in the research and development of alternate means of cutting and coagulating tissue. Along with Dr. Tom Davison he was the principle developer of ultrasonically activated cutting and coagulating, a technique now used throughout the world."

S"Jim Anderson's research concentrates on applications of neural networks to cognitive science.  An appropriately designed network can do many pattern recognition functions in ways reminiscent of human performance.  Neural networks have practical applications and can also serve as models for human behavior.<br /><br />Anderson's group does research in several areas. Networks have been applied to models of human concept formation, to speech perception, and to models of low-level vision, such as the way local motion signals can be integrated to determine global object motion or the direction of self-motion.  A current project involves the study of elementary arithmetic, a problem that is surprisingly hard for both humans and neural networks.  Study of elementary mathematics also raises questions about the way a neural network can be designed to perform effectively more general mathematical operations.<br /><br />Recent work has considered how intermediate-level structure in the nervous system might be configured, and how it might be detected in experimental data, as well as what kind of computations it might perform. In light of data from both multiple unit recordings and functional MRI, a model using a network of local networks is being studied."

S'I study how brains and computers are different in the way they compute. These  differences arise in large part because of basic physical differences in their hardware. I  research brain-like computation using "neural networks," simplifications of the  complexities of real brains. Besides offering clues to brain functions as models, neural  networks perform some practical applications. For example, I applied a simple neural  network model, originally derived to explain how humans form concepts based on experience, to the problem of "understanding" a complex radar environment. More  recently, I have been working on a set of models for the intermediate-level organization  of the nervous system. Scientists know a great deal about individual neurons. We also  know a good deal about behavior and the functioning of very large groups of neurons.  But we know almost nothing about how groups of a hundred or a thousand or even a  hundred thousand neurons cooperate to compute, or perceive, or think, or behave. One  question I am now trying to answer concerns scaling. Under what conditions can similar  computational functions be performed by networks of greatly differing size?<br /><br />I became interested in brains and computers as a graduate student in psychology and  neuroscience at M.I.T. I wanted to know how I worked. And, if we learn enough about  brains, perhaps eventually we may be able to build machines that work the way we do.'

S'My interest is in the complexity of moral psychology. I am currently interested in questions related to the problem of Free Will. Some believe, or fear, that if human actions and human minds are as subject to the laws of nature as other objects &#150; in other words, if we do not have a special quality called free will &#150; then our lives would thereby be meaningless, offering no meaningful relatedness between people or other things and no prospect for meaningful achievement. Furthermore, without free will, many fear that there would be no way to determine moral responsibility. Is this true? Or can all these valuable things exist even at a deterministic world? Can some of these values exist, but not others? Working on this question leads to related questions - what is it to respond to meaning? What it is to respond to reasons or be rational? What it is to be morally praiseworthy or blameworthy? And what is that thing called "freedom of the will" that some of us fear not having?'

S'As the discovery of the genetic substrates of neuropsychiatric disorders is hoped to lead to improved pathophysiologic understanding, enhanced treatments and relief from stigma for both the affected individuals and the field, the lack of strong, reliable and translatable genetic findings is a critical problem.  My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of analytic methods that will ultimately enable the identification and characterization of genes contributing to risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Ultimately, such information will contribute to advances in the phenotyping and treatment of major psychiatric disorders. To accomplish this end, I believe the most fruitful strategies will involve statistical and computational approaches to hypothesis-testing using the presently abundant genetic, genomic and bioinformatics data relevant to the etiology and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The research planned under my K08 award seeks to address one of the greatest challenges facing psychiatry today, which is not how it will collect new and better data, but how it will translate the massive repositories of genetic, biological and bioinformatics data into better understanding of disease and rational clinical care.<br /><br />The objective of my current NIMH K08 Mentored Career-Development Award is to develop my career and research trajectories through continuing multidisciplinary training and mentorship in the fields of molecular biology, statistical genetics, bioinformatics and computational biology. The specific goals of my K08 research project are: 1) to use pathways-based and functional genomic analyses to identify gene sets, defined in terms of shared biological attributes-including ontologies, biological pathways, protein domain structure, orthology and brain expression signatures-that are most likely to contain general and disease-specific susceptibility genes across affected bipolar, schizophrenia and substance abuse populations; and 2) to use advanced computational methods to determine the underlying genetic architecture of bipolar disease susceptibility in affected individuals, including the relative contributions of genetic heterogeneity and interactions. <br /><br />The central hypotheses fueling my K08 application and my research more generally are that: a) shared and disease-specific genetic susceptibility to several neuropsychiatric disorders, at the population-level, is mediated by disruption of genes characterized by one or a limited combination of shared and discernable biological attributes, and b) the genetic architecture of these complex disorders is characterized by substantial inter-individual genetic heterogeneity. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of previous studies in complex genetic disorders, results and inconsistencies of previous neuropsychiatric research, as well as our own preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed research is that, first, uncovering the particular biological attributes defining susceptibility genes is likely to be of much greater significance to our understanding of disease and to future discovery efforts than any current single marker finding. Second, discovering the nature of the complex genetic architecture will inform valid models of genetic transmission and refinements of phenotypes upon which the design of future studies can be based. In so doing, it will also test the validity of the guiding assumptions about genetic risk in current neuropsychiatric genetic research. And third, together these results will make possible more targeted resequencing, fine-mapping and functional studies to uncover both the common and rare, as yet elusive, functional variants.'

S'The Laboratory of Molecular Virology at Brown University (Atwood Lab)<br /><br />Our laboratory is focused on studying the pathogenesis of the human polyomaviruses, JC Virus (JCV) and BK Virus (BKV). Reactivation of JCV under conditions of immunosuppression leads to the fatal demyelinating disease in humans known as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). Approximately 5% of patients with AIDS will develop PML and the majority succumb within two years of diagnosis.  Reactivation of BKV in kidney transplant recipients has emerged as a major problem in the last decade and is responsible for nearly half of all kidney transplant failures. The major focus of the lab is studying early events that mediate infection of cells by these viruses. These early events include but are not limited to studies of virus-host cell receptor interactions, endocytic trafficking of virus from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, and virus induced membrane signaling. We have a general interest in studying events that contribute to viral tropism and regulate the balance between infection and resistance. We also focus our efforts at screening lead compounds that block any of these key steps in the viral life cycle as potential therapies to treat or prevent disease caused by JCV and BKV. We approach these problems using state of the art techniques in cell and molecular biology and genetics. Examples of projects of interest are listed below.<br /><br />Virus-Host Cell Receptor Interactions<br />&#149; Identify host cell receptors and co-receptors for the human polyomaviruses, JCV and BKV<br />&#149; Determine the cell and tissue distribution of virus receptors<br />&#149; Identify factors that increase or decrease virus receptor expression on cells and in tissues<br />&#149; Identify critical residues in the viral capsid that mediates binding to virus receptors<br /><br />Cell Biology<br />&#149; Define the role of the cytoskeleton in trafficking of virus from the plasma membrane to the nucleus<br />&#149; Determine the mechanism by which JCV and BKV deliver their respective genomes across the nuclear membrane<br />&#149; Identify the site and mechanism of virus uncoating<br /><br />Molecular Biology<br />&#149; Characterize molecular signals induced upon virus binding to host cell surfaces<br />&#149; Characterize downstream signal transduction events and define how they impact viral infection<br />&#149; Define the cellular and viral determinants that mediate signaling<br /><br />Genetics and Genomics<br />&#149; Identify host cell genes that are turned on or off in response to viral infection<br />&#149; Identify genes that are differentially expressed in cells that are resistant to JCV infection versus cells that are susceptible to infection<br /><br />Molecular Medicine<br />&#149; Identify compounds capable of preventing the establishment of viral infection in host cells and interfering with the replication and growth of human polyomaviruses <br />&#149; Identify risk factors for the development of PML in HIV infected and other immunosuppressed patient populations<br />&#149; Identify risk factors for the development of BKV associated nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients'

S'The work in our laboratory has centered on understanding the patho-physiological effects of shock/ tissue injury/ sepsis that lead to immune dysfunction and subsequent multiple organ failure in the critically ill trauma patient (through animal modeling and collaborative clinical studies). We have described, over the years, numerous deficits in both components of cell-mediated (T-cell, NKT-cell, gd T-cell, Treg-cell, etc) and innate (macrophage, neutrophil, dendritic cells) immune responsiveness induced by shock or sepsis, which are underpinned by alterations in cell signaling, protein translation and transcription patterns. Particular emphasis has been directed at defining the role of soluble mediators (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, IL-16, MCP-1, MIP-2/KC/IL-8, TGF-b, PGE2, NO, steroids, etc.), inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1:PD-L1/L2, BTLA:HVEM, FasL:Fas, etc.) and/or cellular pathways (e.g., p38 MAPKs, STAT 1/4/6, SOCS 1/3, Shp1/2, Rip1/3, NFkB, etc.) involved in orchestrating these changes in mouse models and critically ill patient. We have also found evidence of alterations of the immune cell\'s apoptotic process, present in these animals and are actively examining the contribution of this pathway.  It is our hope that, by understanding the cellular/molecular mechanisms which control these alterations in the traumatized or septic animal/patient, we will improve our ability to treat them. <br /><br><b>Major Theme of Research:</b> Immunology and infection<br><br /><br /><br><b><i>Laboratory Staff-Contact List  (Rev: 2/3/2011): </i></b><br><br /><br /><b><i><a href="http://med.brown.edu/surgery/research/documents/XinHuangDiv-Bio11-2010.pdf">Xin Huang, Ph.D., M.D.</a></i></b><br />Research Associate <br />Aldrich 242 <br />401-444-6706 <br /><a href=mailto:XHuang@lifespan.org>XHuang@lifespan.org</a><br /><br /><b><i><a href="http://med.brown.edu/surgery/research/documents/SeanMonaghanDiv-Bio10-2010.pdf">Sean Monaghan, M.D.</a></i></b><br />Armand D.

S'My research is focused on two related lines. One line is the development of Arabic. And its spread in the Arab Middle East. In 2002, I published an article on the socio-demographic parameters of the Arabicization of Syria, Iraq and Egypt. In this article, I discussed the non-linguistic factors that facilitated the spread of Arabic in these areas after the Arab conquests. In addition, I discussed effects of these demographic and socio-political factors in the choice of the native-speaker register used in communicating with non-Arabs, and the degrees of simplification these circumstances must of dictated on the native speakers of Arabic. In 2007, I published On the Foreigner Talk registers that the Arabs use with foreigners, in general and in communicative contexts where the difference in levels is high in particular. In 2008, I published another article to explain the structural features of the Arabic language Before the Arab conquests in the seventh century AD. I also laid out my p[oint of view about the issue of the use in pre-Islamic Arabia of the pre-Classical language. <br />In the same year, I published a book in which I introduced a theory of the spread and development of the Arabic language after the Arab conquests. The basic idea in the book was that Arabic spread and was modified by means of it being learnt as a second language in an informal setting and only for communicative and functional purposes.  I discussed the contexts where languages in general are being learnt for functional purposes, and the quality of input this situation generally allows. I also discussed the registers and modifications native speakers of the target language always use with non-native learners of the language for communication. I compared, after that, the data available from Old Arabic, New Arabic historical dialects, and dialects of Modern Arabic times, and came to the conclusion that Arabic could only have developed as a function of that learning process. <br />I am currently about to finish another monograph on the Arabic language in East Africa, where I am testing the hypothesis of my earlier monograph. The main argument of the book will be that Arabic developed full traditional dialects in areas where socio-demographic factors were similar to the ones in the historical cases of the Arab Middle East. Arabic was enabled in these areas to be used for communicative purposes, and similar native speaker stratigies were used by native speakers of Arabic with the non-native interlocutors for communicative purposes. In other areas, where socio-demographic factors were different and where Arabic was not used as a communicative variety in the same manner, native speaker strategies were muted, and the final or process product was different. In East Africa, Arabic exhibits different varieties. It is present in a pidgin format, as a creole language, as a trade jargon, and as a remote language of education and prestige. <br />The second line of my research is related to the first historical and developmental one. I take up the different definitions given to the complex of the Arabic language. I published in 2007 a commentary on the idea of diglossia in the Arabic language. In this article I assert that before we claim that there is diglossia in the Arabic case we have to start by defining levels, continua, and linguistic registers. Before that, any scientific discussion of diglossia is unwarranted. In addition, I published two translations for the seminal articles of Fergisson (1959) and Corriente (1975) on diglossia. I am currently working on a historical comparative study of some syntactic features of the Arabic language along several periods to understand if our understanding of the development of Arabic, hence our developmental set of terminology is justifiable.'

S'The following is a summary of some of Dr. Bahar\'s reserch projects:<br /><br />1.  "Using Identified Circuit Invariance for Online Error Detection" <br />Detection and correction of errors is becoming increasingly critical as integrated circuits scale to smaller feature sizes and become more susceptible to a host of problems caused by process variations, defects, operational influences and environmental influences. Ensuring reliable computation at the nanoscale thus requires mechanisms to detect and correct errors during normal circuit operation.  This project explores novel approaches for automatically designing efficient online error detection logic for circuits based on the identification of invariant relationships.  In particular, our approach automatically identifies gate-level invariant relationships (or logic implications) that must be satisfied for a circuit to operate correctly.  No knowledge of high-level behavioral constraints is required to identify these invariant relationships.  These implications are then incorporated into checker logic that will flag an error when an implication is violated. We have found that checking for implication violations can be a very powerful approach for error detection, and in our results so far have shown that significant error coverage is possible, even with only a 10% area overhead.  The novel contributions of this project lie primarily in the efficient identification of those implications that are most valuable for error detection and in the incorporation of those implications into the low-overhead error-checking hardware.  Our approach is applicable for detecting static, dynamic, and delay faults generated from single-event upsets or missed manufacturing defects.  It can also be used for detecting faults that manifest themselves across multiple clock cycles.  It addition, we have also extended this work to consider using implications to provide test vector compaction.  <br /><br /><br />2. "Prediction of Soft Errors in Nanoscale Circutis and Design of Noise Tolerant Circuits" <br />This project is a continuation of our work on probabilistic devices and architectures for nanoscale computation.  A key finding that was missing from our previous work was an in-depth analysis of the expected error rates in ultimate CMOS circuits.  Electrical noise will play an increasingly critical role in future nanoscale CMOS circuit operation characterized by lower supply voltages and smaller device sizes. Both of these downscaling approaches reduce the margin of immunity to thermal noise, alpha particle strikes, and threshold voltage variations. This project investigates the noise probability distributions for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium logic states of advanced CMOS flip-flops operated at ultra-low VDD. We have shown that such nanoscale flip-flop designs are extremely sensitive to threshold variations, reducing average failure time to a few days. We are currently working on extending this analysis to alpha particle strikes.  <br /><br />3. "Energy Efficient Synchronization Techniques for Embedded Architectures"<br />Because many embedded devices run on batteries, energy efficiency is perhaps the single most important criterion for evaluating hardware and software effectiveness in embedded devices. In this project, we evaluate the energy-efficiency and performance of a number of synchronization mechanisms adapted for embedded devices. We focus on providing simple hardware accelerators for common software synchronization patterns found in embedded systems.  In particular, we have looked into developing energy-efficient speculative approaches such as transactional memory on an embedded platform.  The transactional model speculatively assumes shared memory accesses from simultaneously executing programs will not conflict, allowing for increased throughput in the event that there is no contention.  However, if a conflict is detected during a transaction, the transaction needs to be rolled back and re-executed, resulting in wasted energy, which could be especially detrimental in an embedded environment.  The challenge is then to make that transactional memory on an embedded platform is cost-effective both in terms of throughput and energy. We have compared the energy efficiency of a range of shared memory benchmarks using both spin-locks and hardware transactional memory and have found that in most cases, our transactional memory implementation provides both significantly reduced energy consumption and increased throughput.  We are also considering applications that employ concurrency patterns based on conditional synchronization, or semaphores, such as pipelines and barriers. We have proposed a novel energy-efficient hardware semaphore construction in which cores spin on local scratch-pad memory, reducing the load on the shared bus, thereby reducing energy consumption.'

S"There is a great interest in understanding processes occurring in the ground and excited states of both atoms and molecules. Professor Baird's research in chemical physics involves studies of energy and state transfer collisions, as well as measurement of energy level separations, in simple molecular and atomic species. For example, in studying the resonance fluorescence from atomic thallium it has been possible to measure the free atomic lifetime, radiation trapping (coherent narrowing), the resonance collision cross sections caused by rare gas thallium collisions. Also in these studies there is evidence of multiple collisions in the excited state-ground state atoms.  Of interest too are experiments testing the fundamentals of atomic and molecular physics. Research on atomic hydrogen a few years ago played a role in determining the viability of quantum electrodynamics as a correct theory for the electromagnetic interaction to distances on the order of 1013 cm. Current interest is with studies of spin polarized hydrogen at low temperatures. Theoretical work on this system includes studies of collisions at very low energies, calculation of the spin-exchange cross section, nuclear spin relaxation times, and modeling of two dimensional scattering and spin-exchange scattering.  Research work on molecular species has involved experimental measurements of fine and hyperfine structure, and theoretical studies of the spin-orbit and spin-dipolar interactions in molecules. Of current interest are efforts to excite molecules to energy levels just below and above the dissociation limit, and to theoretically calculate their positions. The experimental techniques used include optical pumping, coherent excitation, and radio frequencies, as well as digital data handling methods."

A book on implication in music of the eighteenth-century is nearing completion, and volumes dealing with nineteenth- and twentieth-century music will follow. I have published several extensive studies of chromaticism in eighteenth-century music, based on an approach suggested by Schoenberg and Webern at the beginning of the twentieth century. My work on post-tonal and serial music uses a variety of approaches, including pitch-class set theory. I combine analytical methods to explore the co-existence of tonal and extra-tonal structural relations in post-tonal music. I have published cultural historical studies on Liszt and Scriabin. My courses in analysis and performance employ topical, semiotic, and hermeneutic approaches, in addition to those mentioned above. My work in music cognition includes a published article on the keyboard as basis for musical imaging in Western art music. I am a pianist, and, while I perform in concerts only occasionally, my teaching and lecturing continually address performance concerns.'

S'The following list contains a description of my current pedagogical research from my successful proposal for the NSF Director\'s Award for Distinguished Teaching Scholar, followed by a summary of my research contributions in the past 38 years, and a list of projects that tie together my research areas and expository writing and undergraduate teaching.<br /><br /><b>Summary of the Project for the DTS Director\'s Award for Distinguished Teaching Scholar</b>:<br /><br />Interactive Internet-Based Mathematics Teaching and Learning is the latest version of an ongoing project that is now ready for active and broad dissemination.  The term "interactive" plays multiple roles in this project:  1)  Teachers and students interact with geometric phenomena by means of powerful, flexible, locally-developed, accessible and easy-to-use Java applets, both for classroom presentations and for student explorations; 2)  In a paperless setting, students do their homework and examinations online using html shortcuts requiring almost no learning time, and they receive timely comments from instructors, often leading to further interchanges; and 3)  After appropriate delays, students can read the responses of their classmates, as well as instructor comments, and engage directly in discussion or group work over the web.<br /><br />The communication software that makes this interaction possible, as well as the demonstration software for illustrations and animations, has all been developed by teams of students, almost all undergraduates, in a series of NSF sponsored projects in the Division of Undergraduate Education and the Research on Learning and Education program of the Education and Human Resources division.  Six years ago the software for this approach required sessions in a workstation laboratory using proprietary communications programs requiring sophisticated word processing.  As a result of the most recent project, the communications software has been rewritten in a much more stable and powerful form, and in a form that can be transferred easily to other teaching situations.  A small number of html shortcuts make it possible for students to begin entering text and simple mathematical expressions almost immediately.  Tutorials written by student assistants make it easy for students without sophisticated computer background to upload scanned drawings and to include images and links in their responses.  Recent improvements enable students to include interactive illustrations from Geometer\'s Sketchpad.<br /><br />The demonstration software includes several features not available on many other general purpose proprietary packages. Teachers and students can easily modify model programs to change functions and parameters, and to include other functions, either in the same or in a different window, responding to the same parameter changes and rotations in three-space in linked windows.  Once a user finds a particularly appropriate example, it is possible to save the entire state and enter it as a button in a homework or exam response, so the viewer can enter the program in precisely the configuration that was chosen and proceed to investigate the phenomena further. Students who become very familiar with the software immediately become potential resources and collaborators with the teacher, producing increasingly elaborate and sophisticated demonstrations for use in classrooms and in presentations to researchers and general audiences.<br /><br /><b>The Plan</b><br /><br />Course Materials Development generally proceeds in three steps over a three-year period, with the first summer devoted to drafting a set of laboratory demonstrations and accompanying text for use in the next academic year in the PI\'s classes, with a detailed evaluation of results.  The second summer refines those materials and features them in a workshop at the MathFest or similar conference to prepare teachers who will use them in different ways at their institutions.  The third summer uses the evaluations of the various experiences to create an electronic document that can be used by teachers without workshop preparation.  A summary evaluation assesses the effectiveness of the materials in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning.<br /><br /><b>Schedule of Course Development</b><br /><br />Differential Geometry is in the second stage as of the summer of 2004.  Multivariable Calculus will start its first stage in 2004, and Linear Algebra will begin in 2005.  In Summer 2006, the topic will be a combination of Euclidean and non-Euclidean Geometry and some Combinatorial Topology.  In each of these courses, the PI has experience using computer-generated materials and earlier versions of the communication software.  Student assistants are chosen from among those who show special talent for mathematics and computer science in course using this approach.  <br /><br /><b>Workshops and Conferences</b><br /><br />The workshops for familiarizing potential users of the software and electronic materials will be held in conjunction with the summer MathFests of the MAA, with additional meetings at the January Joint Mathematics Meetings.  In 2004, the PI will make a presentation to the NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) fellows at the Providence MathFest, and announce dissemination plans in the special session on web use designed by WebSIGMAA, the MAA Special Interest Group on that topic.  We will mount a library exhibit at Brown University on "The Man Who Wrote \'Flatland\'", and invite a discussion on the use of the Abbott/"Flatland" database in liberal arts mathematics courses.  At the 2005 Joint Meetings in Atlanta, there will be an informational session for representatives of schools in the area to discuss a possible semester-long project in the spring of 2006, with teachers from various institutions carrying out projects, starting with a conference and meeting monthly to compare experiences.<br /><br />The DTS award will act as seed money for a larger proposal, possibly in the Adaptation and Implementation program of the NSF.  The PI would request a one-semester leave of absence and seek a visiting position at the University of Georgia and/or Spelman College. Other participating schools might include Georgia Tech, Emory, Morehouse, Agnes Scott, Georgia State, and the Paideia School. Possible locations for subsequent experiments of the same sort are the San Francisco Bay Area, or the Cleveland-Pittsburgh area.  Similar workshops will be held in MathFests and Joint Meetings, to parallel the development of course materials described above. <br /><br />Liberal Arts Mathematics and Exposition of Mathematics will concentrate on developing electronic versions of several texts and other materials already in use by teachers in different parts of the country. The PI\'s Scientific American Library volume "Beyond the Third Dimension" has sold over 30,000 copies in paper format, and it has been used as a text in liberal arts math classes at a number of institutions, including Slippery Rock University, Stritch University, Union College, Dartmouth College, and Alma College. The electronic version to be developed in 2004 and 2005 will include a full set of interactive illustrations, as well as pedagogical materials for each of the nine chapters, including exercises, projects, and research topics. A parallel project is an electronic version of "The Fourth Dimension Simply Explained," written by Brown professor Henry Parker Manning in 1911 and due to be reprinted by Dover Publications in 2005 with a new introduction by the PI.  A third project, to be completed in 2006, is a reworking and updating of the interactive poster "Math Spans All Dimensions" by the PI and Davide Cervone, which first appeared for Math Awareness Month 2000 when the PI was chair of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics and president of the MAA.<br /><br /><b>Transferability</b><br /><br />Adaptability:  The electronic materials and communication and visualization software can be used in many different ways in different kinds of courses. At the minimal level, teachers can suggest the use of electronic materials as optional supplements, and at the other end of the spectrum, they can use them as a text following a detailed syllabus. Minimally, teachers can rely on "canned" standardized demos on videotape or CD.  At the next level, they can modify demos to suit particular purposes, and even design new demonstrations from the beginning, perhaps with the help of a student assistant recruited from an earlier class. At a higher level, students can interact with demonstrations on their own, modifying parameters and entering new objects. A special feature of the visualization software developed by the PI and assistants is the ability to "save a state," inserting a link into a homework or examination so that the instructor, and everyone else, can not only see the illustration, but also enter into the program where the first person left off and continue to investigate the phenomena at hand.<br /><br />Standard software can allow students to participate in discussion groups and communicate by email with professors, and this minimal interaction can be enhanced by a file server in a mathematics department. Slightly more sophisticated servers can make it possible for students to hand in work online and receive commentary. It\'s also possible to use the software developed by the PI and his students to run a "paperless class," with all work handed in online, including examinations, and where, after an appropriate time delay, class members can see the work of all other students and the comments. In a workshop, the entire range of possibilities will be presented, and teachers can choose to try out some features or others in their classes.<br /><br />Scalability:  The full operation of interactive Internet-based teaching and learning requires the chance for the instructor to comment on individual student responses in a timely manner, and the opportunity for students to view responses from classmates. For a large class, this can become unwieldy, unless there is a way to break the group into smaller working sections, each monitored by a single instructor or teaching assistant. For classes using only the text and demonstration software with little student interaction, scalability is not such a significant factor. Workshops will explore ways of using the electronic materials and courseware in ways that are suitable for large or multi-section courses, a research challenge in itself.<br /><br /><b>Assessment and Evaluation</b><br /><br />In the PI\'s current NSF-sponsored project in the ROLE program, there is special emphasis on developing effective means of assessing the success of the project in enhancing teaching and learning. This becomes even more important as we enter the dissemination phase of the project, as potential users want to know results of prior experience when they consider using a version of this approach suited to their needs and the needs of their students and institutions. We have data for more than a dozen courses that have used this approach to a substantial extent, mostly at Brown, but also in courses the PI has taught at Yale University, University of Notre Dame, and UCLA. To make better use of these data, and to obtain more sophisticated information, we have recently redesigned our pre- and post-questionnaires with the help of a professional market researcher who is a specialist in the creation of questionnaires and in the analysis of qualitative data. The information we have already received is helping in the reconfiguration of our approach, keeping in mind the different circumstances of our possible collaborators. The questionnaire used this past year (Spring 2003 and Fall 2003) has nine questions, each with several parts, covering 1) online assignments, 2) solution keys and hints, 3) online student interaction, 4) online communication with instructors, 5) timing of assignments, 6) examinations, 7) group work, 8) textbook, and 9) computer demonstrations. The results are displayed in spreadsheets showing the responses of students (columns) to given sub-questions (rows). For any question of particular interest, a content analysis is conducted by coding qualitative responses into categories suggested by the responses. A summary table on each question presents a count as opposed to percentages (for samples of less than 50 respondents),  supplemented by verbatim comments that illustrate or emphasize specific points. This method raises our data collection and analyses to a professional level, representing a substantial improvement over earlier assessment efforts and allowing us to use quotations and anecdotes in context.<br /><br />Sample Content Analysis:  An illustration of the value of this assessment method is the analysis of responses to an important question about our approach, namely the "comfort" level students report, given the centrality of the element of viewing the work of their classmates, and instructor comments. The sample here is taken for Math 35, the honors multivariable calculus course for entering freshmen with the equivalent of a 5 in the BC Advanced Placement Calculus Exam. Completed course evaluations were recorded from 27 out of 37 students (73%). Learning from questionnaires collected in last spring\'s courses, we split the question about comfort level into two parts, one for homework and the other for examinations. We used content analysis us to look for patterns in students\' responses and the results have been used to generate additional ways to improve the interactive process for students.<br /><br />Several students reported changes in their attitudes over time. Most interesting is the student who said: "In the beginning I really did not like the system of reading other student homeworks.  It made me feel really nervous and exposed and it made me want to leave problems blank rather than to put in an incorrect answer. As the semester progressed I realized what a useful tool it could be and I started reading other people\'s hw responses more and more and felt more comfortable with mine being read."<br /><br />Another student addressed motivation: "It didn\'t really bother me that other people could look at my work, either at the beginning or the end of the semester.  Sometimes I felt bad about the quality of the work that I handed in and I might have preferred that others not look at it, but it didn\'t concern me enough to make me want to change the system and the motivation to do a better job probably didn\'t hurt either."<br /><br />As the numbers indicate, some students felt differently about exams: "I think I am more self-conscious about my exams. At first I didn\'t mind so much, but now I am beginning to think that there should be some element of privacy with exams, or a way to choose to have your exam available or not".  A counter-intuitive response was: "I have always been self-conscious about having work of mine open to criticism, so I was slightly uncomfortable (about the homework being available)" but "On exams, I was able to put more time into refining my answer, so I didn\'t mind having people see that."<br /><br />As a result of this analysis, we are modifying the tensor to allow individual students a choice: to make their exams and the instructors\' comments unavailable for viewing by their classmates.  Responses to the analysis of other questions have also led to modifications and refinements; we expect this to continue during the dissemination phase of our project.<br /><br /><b>Summary of Research and Associated Projects</b>:<br /><br />Synopsis of Research Contributions  <br />In terms of general areas, my research career deals with several major topics.  In each case there is a set of papers in a particular decade, followed up by generalizations and/or extended expository treatments at later times.  A unifying factor has been my career-long involvement with interactive computer graphics for investigating phenomena in differential and polyhedral geometry and for presenting illustrations, examples, and results in my undergraduate courses and in colloquia, conferences, and talks to broad audiences. In the following list, I collect papers by category, roughly in chronological order within each. There are slightly more than two items per year in the bibliograph, so the date of the item labeled n appeared roughly in the year 1965 + n/2.<br /><br />1. Tight and Taut Mappings:   My thesis [1], written under the direction of Prof. Shiing-Shen Chern, introduced the term "tight" into the subject of minimal total absolute curvature, and produced the first examples of tight embeddings of polyhedral surfaces in dimensions six and higher. Also from my thesis are the first examples in [7] of globally non-rigid tight polyhedral tori.  The two-piece property was first developed in [8] and the spherical version in [5] was the first paper in what has become the study of "taut" mappings. Higher-codimension examples of tight polyhedral embeddings of spheres first appeared in [10].  The first examples of tight polyhedral Klein bottles were constructed in [7], which also proved uniqueness for the six-vertex embedding of the real projective plane into 6-space, the counterpart of the uniqueness theorem for smooth surfaces of my mentor Nicolaas Kuiper and my colleague William Pohl. Tightness for surfaces with boundary was the thesis subject of Lucio Rodriguez, my first Ph.D. student, and intermediate tautness was first introduced in the thesis of another of my doctoral students, Eugene Curtin.  A third Ph.D.student, Leslie Coghlan, classified tight general position mappings of the real projective plane. Wolfgang Kuehnel and I published two extensive investigations of his remarkable nine-vertex tight triangulation of the complex projective plane in [37] and [62].  The story of the first decade in the theories of tight and taut immersions appears in [47].  For a treatment of the entire subject over the past 30 years, see the survey article [73], written with Wolfgang Kuehnel, in the MSRI volume on "Tight and Taut Submanifolds" edited by Chern and Thomas Cecil, my former student and long-time colleague in the Clavius Research Group.  That volume was dedicated to the memory of Kuiper and it included a posthumous article which Cecil and I helped to prepare for publication [75],[76].<br /><br />2. Critical Points and Curvature for Polyhedral Manifolds:  My post-doctoral research program as a Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard and a research associate with Kuiper at the Universiteit van Amsterdam introduced combinatorial methods in global differential geometry in [2] and [6], reprinted in the collection [29]. The general theory of curvature for mappings into subspaces of higher dimension appeared two decades later in my article [41]. In my paper [21] with Floris Takens, I presented the first results on critical point theory for polyhedral surfaces with no natural Gauss mapping, and with behavior different from a smooth embedding or immersion.<br /><br />3. Geometry of Characteristic Classes:  In 1974, right after my first sabbatical, [15] and [16] presented the first published proofs of the basic result that the number of triple points of a generic immersion of a surface into three-space is congruent modulo 2 to the Euler characteristic. This result has been the starting point for many investigations by other mathematicians, and it led to my work on the Stiefel-Whitney classes for polyhedral manifolds in [19],  the Whitney duality theorem [25] with Clint McCrory, and combinatorial formulas for normal Euler classes of polyhedra [28], also with McCrory. The Whitney Duality Theorem for polyhedral manifolds was treated in the thesis of my Ph.D. student Ockle Johnson. Three years ago, he and I together published a major paper on normal Euler classes for polyhedral surfaces in four-space [76].  A related set of theorems is contained in my article with Frank Farris on Euler numbers and complex points for smooth surfaces in four-space [65].  A generalization of the triple point theorem for stable mappings with singularities is a critical component of my work [44] with McCrory and Terence Gaffney on tritangent planes of Space Curves.<br /><br />4. Global Geometry of Curves and Polygons: This category includes articles  in an ongoing research program. Total Central Curvature of Curves [3] was first presented to the student group at the University of Amsterdam. For the joint paper [9] with William Pohl, I contributed an explicit elementary argument in the case of curves in the plane. Polyhedral catastrophe theory [12] is the first part of a paper that has yet to be given, most appropriately as an interactive electronic document. The Fabricius-Bjerre theorem in the polygonal case in the plane [13] leads to generalizations to double tangency theorems for pairs of surfaces in 4-space [33]. Self-Linking for Polygons [23] includes global results for torsion of smooth space curves as well, carried over in [35] to theorems of Milnor and Jacobi. My article [36] with Edwin Beckenbach\'s was his last joint paper, treating phenomena for curves related to optics. Three papers with Peter Giblin [49], [66], [69] initiated a study of finite models for symmetry sets, in particular piecewise circular curves (with another paper in process). My joint paper [20] with James White established properties of space curves under conformal transformations and introduced the notion of an osculating tube. These ideas appear again in the solution of a problem posed by Kuiper in my most recent research publication [78].<br /><br />5. Geometry of Smooth and Polyhedral Surfaces:  Two early papers investigated submanifolds of the bicylinder boundary, one on minimal surfaces [22] and the other on foliations of knot-complements [18].  My monograph [32] with Clint McCrory and Terence Gaffney examined "Cusps of Gauss Mappings" in a way that led recently to an electronic version, illustrated with full-color animations. This monograph included an expanded version of the paper [30] with Rene Thom, correcting and expanding an example he had considered. My only joint paper with Kuiper [34] was a study of geometrical class and degree involving the construction of key examples in the analytic, smooth, and polyhedral categories.<br /><br />6. Computer Graphics and Differential Geometry:  (This topic necessarily overlaps heavily with the descriptions of my contributions to teaching.) My research on computer graphics and the geometry of submanifolds began in 1968, shortly after my arrival at Brown, in collaboration with Charles Strauss, using the computer graphics technology developed in his Ph.D. thesis with Andries van Dam. Various aspects of this collaboration are described in [11], [14], and [27], culminating in my 45-minute invited address [26] at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki in 1978.  Starting in 1980, collaboration continued in cooperation with undergraduate students in computer science [39], [40], [43], [45], [47], [48], [53], [55], [56], [57], and [58]. A major collaboration with two colleagues in Applied Mathematics and a CS graduate student produced a significant investigation of linear Hamiltonian systems [46].  A related project used graphics to analyze the geometry of the Hopf mapping from the three-sphere to the two-sphere, to analyze regular polytopes in 4-space [50], and to modify an argument of Ulrich Pinkall to give an elementary construction of tori in 3-space representing any conformal type [54]. Beginning in 1990, I have collaborated with my former graduate student Davide Cervone on a series of projects [52], [59], [63], [71], [77], and [80], described more fully in several parts of this proposal.<br /><br />7. Miscellaneous Topics:  My joint paper with Lou Kaufmann on "Immersions and mod 2 Quadratic Forms" [24] was awarded a Lester Ford prize from the MAA in 1978.  The central argument of my article with Michael Rosen, "Periodic Points of Anosov Diffeomorphisms" [4], has been included as appendix in the Dynamical Systems text of Zbigniew Nitecki.  The results of a two-year project on data visualization supported by the Office of Naval Research are contained in [45].<br /><br /><b>Synopsis of Teaching Contributions</b><br />From the beginning of my teaching career, I have experienced a great deal of satisfaction from the responses of my students to my undergraduate courses.  In several articles over the years I have described my teaching methods and the courses I have designed for non-majors as well as majors, The first was an eight-lecture series in a summer institute on Applications of Elementary Calculus [11] in 1971, later reprinted by the MAA, and the most recent was my presentation in response to the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo national award for distinguished college and university teaching [70].  Most of my writings about contributions to the scholarship of teaching and learning are concerned with the use of computer graphics in teaching courses at all levels.  In 1974 and 1978 I published papers [14], [27] with my computer science colleague Charles Strauss about the use of computer graphics in research and teaching, and in 1978, I was asked to present our work in a  invited 45-minute session at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki [26] in the section on history and pedagogy, the first time that computer graphics in mathematics teaching and research was presented before an international audience.  Beginning in 1980, nearly all of my collaborations in computer graphics were with a series of talented undergraduate assistants, most of whom have gone on to distinguished careers in industry and in teaching.  A major paper [39] in 1981 with David Salesin, a senior, and Steve Feiner, a graduate student, presented a new animation language, with applications to surfaces in four-space.  There followed a series of papers co-authored with student assistants on student-generated software for workstation laboratories in differential geometry and in multivariable calculus [48],[53], [55], [56], [57], and [58].  I also co-authored a linear algebra text with John Wermer that included topics from the grometry of four-space [38], now in its second edition [61].  In recent years, since the advent of interactive graphics on the Internet, most of my articles on pedagogy and expository mathematics have been collaborations with Davide Cervone, starting with my sabbatical stay at the Geometry Center at the University of Minnesota in 1974. Examples include the totally electronic journal "Communications in Visual Mathematics", two virtual art gallery projects [77], [80],, and "Math Awareness Month April 2000"[to appear].  Cervone is also primarily responsible for the illustrations in my Scientific American Library volume "Beyond the Third Dimension", the text for my liberal arts mathematics course , now in its second edition [52], [71], [93].<br /><br />&#9;One set of contributions that do not show up on the publication list are the films and videotapes that we have produced over the years.  "The Hypercube: Projections and Slicing" with Charles Strauss (1978) is a classic, still used widely in secondary schools and colleges throughout the country.  The other black and white films from the Helsinki Congress talk (repeated at a second showing by demand and shown twice more at the ICM in Warsaw in 1985) have all been remade in one form or another.  Recent films shown widely at the major graphics conferences include "The Hypersphere: Foliation and Projections" with David Laidlaw, Huseyin Kocak, and David Margolis [1984] and "Fronts & Centers" in collaboration with student assistant Nick Thompson and Composer Gerald Shapiro.  <br /><br />&#9;For the past five years, we have made most of our contributions to classroom teaching in the form of Internet-based courses in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, differential geometry, and the liberal education course "The Mathematical Way of Thinking: The Fourth Dimension".  Starting with programs developed by Dan Margalit, now a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Chicago, we have continued to develop software for communication between students and instructors and among students.  Evidence of the peer regard for this project is the fact that we have just received word from the NSF program officer in the ROLE program (Research on Learning and Education) that our proposal "received high praise from reviewers".  I am in contact with the cognizant program officer negotiating the final budget arrangements.  (I am aware that the final decision is made by the agency and I expect to hear final word soon.)  Here is the short description for that proposal:<br /><br />Project Summary for  "Interactive Internet-Based Mathematics Courses with Geometric Visualization Software":  Over the past five years, the Principal Investigator and student assistants have developed a series of Internet-based courses in a related set of undergraduate mathematics courses utilizing locally developed software for geometric visualization and for communication between students and instructors and among students.  These new models for teaching and learning change the timing and the level of interactivity for instructors and students, and increase the ability of students to handle complex geometric phenomena.  These innovations will be further developed, tested, and evaluated during the period of the proposal.  The aim is to produce effective software that can be used in a wide variety of institutions with students at different levels, for mathematics and for its applications to physical science, computer science,and engineering.<br /><br /><b>Proposed Projects for the DTS Award</b><br />In the Synopsis of Research Contributions, there are seven different topics representing areas where I have written research articles.  Associated with each of these areas, I can identify challenging problems that I have brought up in my undergraduate classes over the past 35 years, modifying the presentation depending on the level of the class. These problems exemplify the kinds interaction between research in mathematics and teaching of undergraduates that has become characteristic of my writings on education and my dozens of presentations each year.  I propose to produce hypertexted interactive articles on at least eight of them over the four years of the award.  These are thought of as separate projects at the present time, although it will be quite good if these presentations can be accumulated into a single volume at the end of this period.  As is usual and appropriate, all of these projects will involve collaboration with undergraduate students as well as with other colleagues who share a  commitment to the interaction of research and undergraduate teaching.  I will describe eight of these projects below to illustrate the range of problems and the possibilities for presenting them in hypertext form with substantial Internet-based interaction.  As elaborated below in the budget justification, the reason for listing eight is that in our experience, it takes a half year to bring any of these projects to completion!  <br /><br />1. Tight and Taut Mappings and the Grid Square Two-Piece Property:  I don\'t know very many mathematicians who can describe their thesis problems to a general audience, but I can.  After a few months of studying the global geometry of smooth surfaces satisfying a condition called "minimal total absolute curvature, I discovered that this condition is equivalent to a very elementary notion, the Two-Piece Property.  An object in space has the TPP if every cut by a long straight knife separates it into at most two pieces.  An egg or an orange has the TPP but a curved banana or a fork does not.  A half cantaloupe has the TPP but a quarter cantaloupe does not.  A doughnut or bagel has the TPP, and so does a half ba'

S'The identity of an odor is deconstructed by the nose and represented by a unique, spatially invariant, combination of structures called glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, the first relay station for olfactory information in the brain. An olfactory map of activity is thus generated in the olfactory bulb. How does the brain reconstruct the identity of an odor from a pattern of active glomeruli in the bulb? Our approach to answer this question combines molecular biology and mouse genetics to map and characterize the neuronal circuits used by the brain for processing olfactory information.<br /><br />Using our knowledge of the biochemistry of signal transduction pathways, we have designed a system for trans-synaptic labeling of neurons in the mouse. The core of the system is a synthetic signaling pathway that is genetically introduced into all neurons in the animal. This signaling pathway translates the activation of an engineered receptor fusion protein into expression of a reporter gene that can be visualized. Specificity is achieved by genetically modifying the olfactory sensory neurons that express a given odorant receptor to secrete the ligand for the engineered receptor into their synapses. Binding of the ligand to its receptors on the projection neurons that form synapses with the modified olfactory neurons will activate the signaling pathway, leading to expression of the reporter gene only in these cells. In this manner, only this subset of projection neurons will be visualized. Our experimental design is not limited to tracing experiments. Since the system is modular, it can be readily adapted for functional studies, in which we will genetically modify a given neuronal circuit and study the behavioral consequences. Ultimately, these studies may elucidate the mechanisms used by the brain to identify odors and to translate this information into behavioral outputs.'

S'I am interested in how the planets and moons in our solar system form and how their interiors evolve over time.  My key areas of interest are Earth\'s Moon and the icy bodies in the outer solar system.  I use numerical and theoretical techniques to model processes that shape the interiors of solid planets, including hydrocodes to model impacts (local- and planetary-scale), and finite-element mantle convection models to study heat transfer inside solid planets.  I also develop techniques to simulate core formation and planetary accretion.<br /><br /><p><b>Resurfacing on Outer Planet Satellites</b></p><br /><p>A fundamental question in planetary science is why some planets show signs of endogenic (meaning, driven by interior forces) resurfacing and others don\'t.  For rocky planets, their size and chemistry (chiefly, crustal water abundance) are thought to be key controlling factors.  However, this is not the case for the icy moons in the outer solar system.  For example, Saturn\'s moon Enceladus, with a radius of only 252 km, is presently active, with plumes of water ice erupting from a warm and tectonically active region in its south pole; whereas Jupiter\'s moon Callisto, with a radius 10x larger, appears to be geologically "dead".  Resurfacing on the outer planet satellites seems to be controlled by tidal flexing and heating; energy contained in the orbits of the satellites is converted to heat by unknown processes.  I am interested in determining the interior processes responsible for tidal heating in solid bodies and the factors that permit resurfacing on tidally heated icy moons. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JE003114">Read more here... </a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.038"> and here...</a></p><br /><br /><p><b>The First Billion Years of Solar System History</p></b><br /><p>The surfaces and interiors of solid planets record subtle clues about the conditions of their formation.  In the inner solar system, the composition of the primary crusts of the rocky planets is heavily dependent on the amount of melting in their interiors during formation, which in turn depends on the timing, duration, and environment of their formation.  In the outer solar system, the interior states of the giant planet satellites hold clues about the conditions of their formation, which is controlled by the lifetime of the solar nebula.  I am developing techniques to model the first few million years of thermal evolution inside solid planets to learn how and when the planets formed. <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n3/abs/ngeo746.html">Read more here...</a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2008.07.004">and here...</a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2010.05.028"> and here...</a></p><br /><br /><p><b> Formation of Earth\'s Moon</b></p><br /><p>The leading theory for the formation of Earth\'s Moon suggests that it formed due to a giant impact between a Mars-sized protoplanet and the early Earth.  The impact produces a disk of molten rock and vapor, which eventually forms the Moon we see today.  Although the giant impact is successful in explaining the size and orbit of the Moon, it cannot readily explain the chemical similarities between the Earth and Moon.  I am using numerical models of planetary impacts to determine the extent of melting and chemical mixing between the two bodies during the giant impact and explore alternate formation scenarios. <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2010/pdf/2488.pdf">Read more...</a></p><br /><br />Persons interested in pursuing research in my group may contact me directly by e-mail:  amy_barr(at)brown(dot)edu'

S'I am currently researching a project provisionally entitled: "Buczacz: The Life and Death of a Multiethnic Town." My goal is to trace the origins of local mass murder in the complexities of relations between different ethnic and religious groups over a long time span in the Eastern Galician town of Buczacz. I will investigate the dynamic that creates, or prevents, the transformation of a community based on interaction and cooperation into a community of genocide. Composed of a mixed Jewish-Polish-Ukrainian population for centuries, Buczacz saw the eradication of its Jewish inhabitants by Nazi murder squads assisted by local collaborators in World War II, and the ethnic cleansing of its Polish population by Ukrainian nationalists. The main outlines of the Holocaust in East Galicia have recently been reconstructed. But we know very little about how genocide actually unfolded on the ground, and about the nature of the social fabric upon which these policies were enacted and to which it reacted. This can be better understood only by delving deeper into the past and providing the perspective of all groups involved in the event.'

S'Born in Israel and educated at Tel Aviv University and St. Antony\'s College, Oxford, Omer Bartov began his scholarly work with research on the Nazi indoctrination of the German Wehrmacht under the Third Reich and the crimes it committed during the war in the Soviet Union. This was the main concern of his first two books, The Eastern Front, 1941-1945, and Hitler\'s Army. He then went on study the links between World War I and the genocidal policies of World War II, as well as the complex relationship between violence, representation, and identity in the twentieth century. His books Murder in Our Midst, Mirrors of Destruction, and Germany\'s War and the Holocaust, have all been preoccupied with various aspects of these questions. Bartov\'s interest in representation also culminated in his monograph, The "Jew" in Cinema, which examines the recycling of antisemitic stereotypes in European, American, and Israeli films. His most recent book, Erased: Vanishing Traces of Jewish Galicia in Present-Day Ukraine, indicates the new direction of his research on interethnic relations in the borderlands of Eastern Europe. The framework for this research was created in the multi-year collaborative project led by Bartov at the Watson Institute for International Studies, titled "Borderlands: Ethnicity, Identity, and Violence in the Shatter-Zone of Empires since 1848." Selected papers from the project will be published in a forthcoming volume. Bartov is currently on leave with an NEH Fellowship writing his new book, Blood Brothers: Buczacz, Biography of a Town.'

S'The cell is a gated community, with walls and gates that are crucial to its integrity and survival.  The cell membrane can in fact be considered a fourth biopolymer in addition to DNA/RNA, proteins, and polysaccharides.  In contrast to the latter three macromolecules, the cell membrane is not held together by covalent bonds between individual monomeric building blocks.  Instead, the membrane is a supramolecular polymer, comprised primarily of lipids held together by non-covalent interactions.  While one of the most important functions of a biomembrane is to serve as a structural barrier, it is becoming increasingly clear that these bilayers are also active functional participants in transmembrane communication.  Much of the cellular communication across this lipid wall occurs via membrane spanning receptor proteins and channels that function as gates.  However, there are several examples of communications being transmitted in the absence of any obvious gate, such as several interactions of cell surface glycoconjugates. These non-canonical molecular recognition events have not been extensively studied to date, and they offer an opportunity to provide new insight into how cells interact and communicate with each other.  <br /><br />Research projects in my group at Brown focus on the molecular recognition and interactions of glycolipids at biomembrane interfaces.  These studies integrate aspects of organic synthesis, biophysics, biochemistry, microbiology, and materials science, and provide a broad scientific training to students and coworkers in my research group.'

S'Judith Bender uses the laboratory plant Arabidopsis to study two aspects of gene regulation: transcriptional silencing by cytosine methylation, and activation of genes involved in plant defense responses. Both of these research areas stem from studies she conducted as a post-Doctoral researcher to understand regulation of tryptophan pathway genes in Arabidopsis. The work on gene silencing evolved from an original finding that an inverted repeat tryptophan gene duplication serves as a potent trigger for cytosine methylation targeted specifically to the duplicated sequences. The Bender laboratory is using this system to understand the signals that direct cytosine methylation to specific regions of the genome, and to characterize factors required for maintenance of methylation and transcriptional silencing. A key finding is that methylation of histone protein H3 at the lysine 9 residue is required for maintenance of cytosine methylation. The other branch of Bender laboratory research focuses on control of genes that synthesize glucosinolates, defense compounds against pathogens, insects, and herbivores that give plants in the mustard family their unique pungent flavor. A major class of glucosinolates is derived from tryptophan. The laboratory is using a key Myb transcription factor that activates the synthesis of these tryptophan-derived compounds both for basic studies on gene activation, and for applications in manipulating the glucosinolate content of plants.'

S'Judith Bender is a molecular geneticist who uses the laboratory plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand basic mechanisms of gene regulation. Professor Bender began as a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University in 1995. She moved to the MCB Department of Brown University in 2007. Her research focuses on how gene expression is silenced by DNA methylation. Her work has elucidated a pathway for  DNA methylation that depends on methylation of DNA-associated histone proteins. Another of her research interests is understanding how Myb proteins, a ubiquitous and highly conserved group of transcriptional regulators in plants, achieve target gene specificity. Besides providing basic insights into the evolution of Myb proteins, this work is relevant to exploiting Myb transcription factors for metabolic engineering. Professor Bender has taught courses in molecular biology and genetics.'

S'Judith Bender studies gene regulation mechanisms using the plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. A major research focus is gene silencing, a process where gene expression is blocked by making DNA inaccessible to activating factors. In plants and animals silencing is critical for normal development and for protecting the genome from the spread of invasive parasitic DNA sequences. The Bender laboratory is particularly interested in how silencing is accurately targeted.'

S"My laboratory is focused on studying the newly identified sexual cycle of Candida albicans.  There are a number of interesting aspects to mating in C. albicans, including the role of 'phenotypic switching', in which cells can reversibly switch their morphology between specialized forms called 'white' and 'opaque'.  While white cells are more virulent in models of systemic infection, only opaque forms are competent to mate.  We are currently investigating the idea that this unique adaptation has arisen to allow mating to occur in the hostile environment of the mammalian host.  <br /><br />A second unusual feature of the C. albicans sexual cycle is that while mating occurs efficiently, no meiotic pathway has been identified yet.  Meiosis is a conserved process in which DNA replication is followed by two successive DNA divisions, effectively halving the DNA content in the cell.  In its place, we have discovered that efficient non-meiotic chromosome loss can be induced in C. albicans, thereby completing a simple sexual cycle in the organism.  Both the mechanism of chromosome loss and the role of the sexual cycle in infection of the host are under investigation.  For example, one model we are presently testing is that the mixing of chromosomes during the mating cycle generates strains with increased genetic diversity.  These new strains could contribute directly to virulence by generating bursts of genetic diversity that aid in fitness in infection."

S'POLITIQUES D\'&#201;CRIVAINS : The principal objective of my new project is to gather pertinent material and information in order to write a new book on the evolution of democratic institutions in three North African countries as reflected in the works of Francophone writers and intellectuals during the last fifteen years. In <i>Experimental Nations or the Invention of the Maghreb</i>, a book published by Princeton University Press in April 2003, I explored the contribution of francophone writers of the Maghreb to the elaboration and revaluation of national identity after the independence of their countries. One of the premises of this new project stems from the observation that, in these countries (namely, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia), debates concerning democracy have taken place not in a public forum, but rather in the creative work of journalists, filmmakers, poets and novelists. In the short run my goal is to visit each one of the countries I have mentioned in order to gather material and to establish the contacts I need in order to achieve the goals I describe in the argument below. Considering that this year France is celebrating "The year of Algeria" -an event that will bring writers, journalists, and artists to participate in a number of cultural events-I think that it is of utmost importance to first spend some time in Paris this summer before visiting the countries of my study.<br /><br />ARGUMENT: <br />The recent history of the three countries of the Maghreb has shown that problems related to human rights, freedom of expression, the political and social status of women, and the rights of ethnic, linguistic, and cultural minorities have found expression primarily in literary, artistic works and communication fora. Indeed, it seems that what was impossible to express through official institutions has been forced to take refuge in the works of fiction, newspapers articles, films, songs and, increasingly, over the Internet. Because these works confront problems that have been branded as taboo, they are often censored or banned by the Government. This is the case with the novels by Algerian writers Kateb Yacine and Nabile Far&#232;s as well as Moroccan and Tunisian writers, including Mohammed Kheireddine and Abdellatif La&#226;bi. These writers have endured many years of exile and in some cases imprisonment for their "offensive opinions." Rereading their works, it is easy to see that the repression brought on them because of their ideas was aimed not so much at specific contents deemed problematic or "seditious," but rather at the fact that these writers and intellectuals have raised questions directly related to democracy--freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of circulation and travel, etc. Although democracy may be inscribed in these countries\' constitutions, it is only rarely manifested in concrete realities.<br /><br />In this work, I have also chosen to study the impact of a newly "imported" ideology--namely Islamic fundamentalism--on the cultural and political institutions of the three countries of the Maghreb. I want to follow the construction and workings of this ideology in the borderlands of political science, philosophy and literary criticism. Political science, because the present conflicts are directly related to political events which occurred during the last ten years: namely, the liberalization of the laws pertaining to the freedom of speech, information, and association; the creation of several associations of the Rights of Man; and the creation of non-governmental newspapers and political organizations. Philosophy, because the major issues which are at stake in the present debates are essentially philosophical, particularly the status of the individual vis-&#224;-vis the state, freedom of speech, gender, status of women in an Islamic society, education, arts, etc. And finally, literary theory, because the most important political and ideological debates stem from the production of newspapers or journal articles, literary studies, novels and poetry.'

S'Berenfeld is currently writing a book on a late antique house at Aphrodisias and the transformation of the site of that house--located in the center of the ancient city--from the Hellenistic and Roman imperial periods through the middle ages. Having done much of her fieldwork in Asia Minor, Berenfeld is particularly interested in the intersection between different cultural traditions and identities, and how art, architecture, objects, and even whole cities were created, adapted, and altered to suit changing cultural interests and prevailing powers. One focus of her work is the exploration of how (and if) domestic space in late antiquity changed as those aspects of urban life that had been largely public in the classical world&#151;pagan cult practice, education, legal activities, etc.&#151;increasingly "came indoors," and how those changes impacted the larger urban experience. She is also interested in the parallel development of early Christian architecture and material culture as its followers and practice emerged from private houses and into the public sphere.<br /><br />As an archaeologist also working in the field of cultural heritage preservation, Berenfeld is also interested in bridging the gap between archaeological research and the conservation, presentation, and interpretation of archaeological sites and material for the public. A major focus of her research in the cultural heritage field is the study of the impacts of global climate change on cultural heritage sites and the development of strategies to address them.'

S'My newest book, <i>Voice Lessons: French M&#233;lodie in the Belle Epoque</i> (Oxford 2010)  examines the modern musical art known as <i>la m&#233;lodie fran&#231;aise</i> and its rise to prominence in the years around 1900. This was a period when France was pouring resources into national literacy and French scholars were beginning to grasp the nuances of the spoken tongue. I explore the relationship between the free, secular, and compulsory school system of the Third Republic, and the experimental sciences of language that grew alongside it, to observe the ways in which both science and school redefined the verbal arts in France at century\'s end. <br /><br />The music of Faur&#233;, Debussy, and Ravel; the writings of Mallarm&#233;, Rimbaud, and Verlaine; the performances of Maggie Teyte, Reynaldo Hahn, and Sarah Bernhardt; the linguistic studies of Paul Passy and Abb&#233; Rousselot: all these sources offer evidence of the new ideas of expression that proliferated during one of the most idealistic moments in French musical history, when poets, composers, actors, singers, and scientists all learned to imagine-and to speak-their language in new ways. Through close readings of songs, poems, sound recordings, and other historical records, Voice Lessons narrates the development of a rare musical art, seeking to explain why this art emerged, why it mattered, and why it eventually disappeared.<br /><br />For more information about the book and the companion website see <a href="http://www.soundidea.org/voicelessons" TARGET="_blank">www.soundidea.org/voicelessons</a>'

S'(1) Carbon Dioxide Functionalization.  As world-wide petrochemical reserves increase in scarcity, chemists must endeavor to find renewable and economical alternatives to fossil fuel carbon sources.  Carbon dioxide, a primary by-product of fossil fuel combustion, offers huge potential as a renewable carbon feedstock, yet has been under-utilized industrially due to its high thermodynamic stability.  Our laboratory seeks to develop organometallic catalysts which convert CO2 to commercially significant chemicals. <br /><br />(2) Petroleum Utilization and New Drug Discovery Techniques.  The combustion of most fossil fuels for their energy content is an inefficient and environmentally damaging use of our scarce petroleum resources.  Improved stewardship of our non-renewable carbon resources (i.e. crude oil) depends on our ability to convert these saturated hydrocarbons to value-added chemicals in an environmentally responsible process.  Our investigations strive to develop transition metal promoted techniques to efficiently utilize alkane resources as precursors to desirable commodity chemicals.  These methods are also employed to establish new techniques in the discovery of pharmaceuticals and other biologically active compounds.'

S'The visual system of the brain is highly parallel in its architecture. This  is clearly evident in the outputs of the retina, which arise from neurons  called ganglion cells. Work in our lab has shown that mammalian retinas contain  more than a dozen distinct types of ganglion cells. Each type appears to  filter the retinal image in a unique way and to relay this processed signal  to a specific set of targets in the brain. My students and I are working  to understand the meaning of this parallel organization through electrophysiological  and anatomical studies. We record from light-responsive ganglion cells in  vitro using the whole-cell patch method. This allows us to correlate directly  the visual response properties, intrinsic electrical behavior, synaptic pharmacology, dendritic morphology and axonal projections of single neurons. Other methods  used in the lab include neuroanatomical tracing techniques, single-unit recording  and immunohistochemistry. We seek to specify the total number of ganglion  cell types, the distinguishing characteristics of each type, and the intraretinal mechanisms (structural, electrical, and synaptic) that shape their stimulus  selectivities. Recent work in the lab has identified a bizarre new ganglion  cell type that is also a photoreceptor, capable of responding to light even  when it is synaptically uncoupled from conventional (rod and cone) photoreceptors.  These ganglion cells appear to play a key role in resetting the biological  clock. It is just this sort of link, between a specific cell type and a well-defined behavioral or perceptual function, that we seek to establish for the full  range of ganglion cell types.<br /><br />My research concerns the structural and functional organization of retinal ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina whose axons make up the optic nerve.  Ganglion cells exhibit great diversity both in their morphology and in their responses to light stimuli.  On this basis, they are divisible into a large number of types (>15).  Each ganglion-cell type appears to send its outputs to a specific set of central visual nuclei. This suggests that ganglion cell heterogeneity has evolved to provide each visual center in the brain with pre-processed representations of the visual scene tailored to its specific functional requirements.  Though the outline of this story has been appreciated for some time,  it has received little systematic exploration.  My laboratory is addressing in parallel three sets of related questions:  1) How many types of ganglion cells are there in a typical mammalian retina and what are their structural and functional characteristics?   2) What combination of  synaptic networks and intrinsic membrane properties are responsible for the characteristic light responses of individual types?  3) What do the functional specializations of individual classes contribute to perceptual function or to visually mediated behavior?   To pursue these questions, we label retinal ganglion cells by retrograde transport from the brain; analyze in vitro their light responses, intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic pharmacology using the whole-cell patch clamp method; and reveal their morphology with intracellular dyes.<br /><br />Recently, we have discovered a novel ganglion cell in rat retina that is intrinsically photosensitive.  These ganglion cells exhibit robust light responses even when all influences from classical photoreceptors (rods and cones) are blocked, either by applying pharmacological agents or by dissociating the ganglion cell from the retina.  These photosensitive ganglion cells seem likely to serve as photoreceptors for the photic synchronization of circadian rhythms, the mechanism that allows us to overcome jet lag.  They project to the circadian pacemaker of the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.  Their temporal kinetics, threshold, dynamic range, and spectral tuning all match known properties of the synchronization or "entrainment" mechanism.  These photosensitive ganglion cells innervate various other brain targets, such as the midbrain pupillary control center, and apparently contribute to a host of behavioral responses to ambient lighting conditions.  These findings help to explain why circadian and pupillary light responses persist in mammals, including humans, with profound disruption of rod and cone function.  Ongoing experiments are designed to elucidate the phototransduction mechanism, including the identity of the photopigment and the nature of downstream signaling pathways.  In other studies, we seek to provide a more detailed characterization of the photic responsiveness and both morphological and functional evidence concerning possible interactions with conventional rod- and cone-driven retinal circuits.  These studies are of potential value in understanding and designing appropriate therapies for jet lag, the negative consequences of shift work, and seasonal affective disorder.'

In addition to its early royal significance, Abydos was an important religious center, town, and set of cemeteries for millennia.  My recent discoveries have included a wealth of Ptolemaic material, including settlement remains, a large family tomb, and a hypogeum for the burial of mummified ibises.  These excavations are ongoing - there is much yet to learn about both the early and the late phases of activity at this important site.'

S'Over the past few years, my writing and research have turned away from questions focused on the "politics of literature," and have begun instead to address the categories that are presupposed in that relation: not only "politics" and "literature" themselves (and closely-related categories such as "ethics" and "aesthetics"), but more basic concepts such as the contemporary, perception, subjectivity, the event, the frame, materiality, the body, and reading. I have published a number of articles dealing with these terms, as well as with theorists working at the intersection of the philosophy of literature, literary criticism and aesthetics, including Georg Luk&#225;cs, Theodor Adorno, Alain Badiou, Gilles Deleuze, and writers such as Paul Auster, Flannery O\'Connor, Dennis Cooper, Kazuo Ishiguro, W. G. Sebald and Jean-Philippe Toussaint. <br /><br />My current larger project attempts to extend and consolidate these readings into an theoretical analysis of the contemporary novel. In response to recent developments in the practice of fiction and criticism, this project will make use of an emergent set of terms and concepts in order to approach the formal preoccupations of the contemporary novel. Drawing on earlier studies such as Mikhail Bakhtin\'s Problems of Dostoevsky\'s Poetics and Luk&#225;cs\'s Theory of the Novel, this project will attempt to re-conceptualize the novel not as a form, but as a logic and a mode of thought, predicated upon a discrepancy between, in Luk&#225;cs\'s words, "the conventionality of the objective world and the interiority of the subjective one." The most important implication of this re-conceptualization is the displacement of the category of representation by that of the event or ontology of the work. A number of questions are thereby brought into play as the proper concern of literary studies: What takes place in the work of fiction? Who or what speaks in the work? Is it possible to think of the materiality of the work separately from its "ideational" qualities? What does it mean to "read" the text? Such questions have always been present in literary studies, but they attain a new urgency and centrality in contemporary literary and critical practice, where the very boundaries of the work are being re-negotiated, and a new relation between criticism and writing forged, one of complicity rather than tension or antagonism.'

S'Maggie Bickford is an historian of art and culture in pre-modern China. She is author of <i>Ink Plum: The Making of a Chinese Scholar-Painting Genre</i> (Cambridge UP 1986), which won the Joseph Levenson Book Prize, Pre-Modern China, awarded by the Association for Asian Studies for the best book of the year in any area on China before the 20th-century. In addition to numerous scholarly articles, she is author and chief curator of the exhibition and scholarly catalogue <i>Bones of Jade, Soul of Ice, the Flowering Plum in Chinese Art</i> (Yale University Art Gallery, 1985), which received the American Association of Museums Award of Distinction. These projects explored genre development and cross-medium developments, including formative interactions between visual and textual cultures.<br /><br />Professor Bickford is a leader in developing syncretic methodologies in multi-disciplinary explorations of key issues in the history of art and culture in China. She currently is engaged in two book projects. <br /><br />In <i>The Shape of Good Fortune: Auspicious Visuality in China</i>, she investigates visualizations of good outcomes (fecundity, longevity, prosperity, peace, and legitimacy) in China during its long imperial period (221BC-1911). In studying these longest and broadest visual traditions in China, she explores intersections and interactions among imperial, elite, and popular traditions and among textual representations, fine arts, and material culture. <br /><br />In <i>Emperor Huizong and Late Northern Song China: the Politics of Culture and the Culture of Politics</i> (forthcoming Harvard University Press, August 2006), Professor Bickford served as co-editor and contributor, working with a group of thirteen scholars from the U.S. and Asia to explore the formative initiatives and consequential interventions of Emperor Huizong (r. 1101-1125) in areas ranging from political administration and frontier warfare to medicine, music, poetry, and art. Professor Bickford\'s Huizong studies focus on painting and calligraphy as instruments of emperorship in the Song dynastic project of rule by culture. She joined issues of auspicious visuality to the deployment of visual art as an instrument of rule in her recent publication, "Emperor Huizong and the Aesthetic of Agency, in <i>Archives of Asian Art</i>, LIII (2002-2003):71-104.<br /><br />Supported by Brown funding, she currently is investigating the potential of computer-assisted close-viewing in research and pedagogy. Projects include: restructuring the history of early painting in China by repositioning canonical works that actually are the creations of later times; reconstructing Song illustrated manuscript culture with respect to the aesthetification of useful knowledge; and, using digital tools to expose the reduplicative mechanics that were employed in imperial Song paintings attributed to individual artists.'

To interpret visual scenes, our brains rely on complex computations across a number of hierarchical levels. In particular, when interpreting images that are locally ambiguous &#150; as is most often the case &#150; our brains bring high-level knowledge to bear on low-level tasks such as image segmentation.

S'Research involvement and publications reflect a long-standing interest in motor behavior of premature and other high-risk infants, particularly with regard to development of self-regulatory and feeding competencies and positive interaction with caregivers. An initial study of the presence of the aymmetrical tonic neck reflex, the attributes of stimulus objects and related patterns of reaching among preterm and full-term infants formed the foundation for a dynamical systems approach to development which could be woven into her clinical approach to infants at risk. For her doctoral dissertation work, Dr. Bigsby further explored dynamical processes by investigating the relation between motor behaviors and physiologic regulation among previously sick preterm and healthy term infants at 3 months corrected age. This work was continued within the clinical context of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as a pilot project studying these same motor behaviors in the sick preterm population, and their relation to physiologic stability and positioning practices, through coding of videotaped observations of the infants before, during and after nursing care.  She has coauthored a textbook on NICU interventions (Developmental and Therapeutic Interventions in the NICU - Brookes Publishing). Currently, she is collaborating with other NICU professionals on proposals to study the impact of the NICU environment on infant and caregiver behavior and development. <br /><br />She is the coauthor of a tool for assessment of fine and gross motor development of high risk infants during the first year of life (Posture and Fine Motor Assessment of Infants (PFMAI) &#150; Psychological Corp/Pearson), which involved Rasch analysis for scaling of items and forming criterion for norm referencing. She has acted as a consultant and trainer for the infant motor assessments used in the multi-site NIH funded "Maternal Lifestyles Study", including the PFMAI and the Peabody Scales of Motor Development, to demonstrate subtle differences between infants who have been exposed to illegal substances in-utero and those who have not. She also has participated in the development of clinical applications for the Neonatal Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS). Dr. Bigsby has mentored graduate students in their study of preterm infant behavior, and the relation between infant sensory and feeding issues, and is currently working with a multi-disciplinary group of professionals in the NICU to develop a questionnaire for a study identifying feeding-related behavioral indicators of gastro-esophageal reflux in preterm infants in the NICU.'

S"The Biron laboratory's research is directed at understanding innate immune responses to viral infections.  The information obtained from its work has helped to open up this exciting field.  Focus is at the level of biological context during evolving responses.  The studies stay close to the in vivo condition, are multi-disciplinary, reveal the complexity of whole organism context, and define mechanisms.  Work began almost exclusively directed at examining natural killer (NK) cells in human and mouse systems.  This lead to characterization of physiologically relevant factors controlling endogenous NK and T cell responses during infections of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV).  The mediators examined include cytokines, glucocorticoid hormones, and chemokines.  The most recent work has moved into defining mechanisms regulating accessibility to intracellular signaling pathways to shape the downstream consequences of cytokine exposure.  The major conclusions and contributions to scientific knowledge can be grouped into four areas:  (1) NK Cell Regulation and Function - The results have significantly contributed to proving NK cells are important in antiviral defense, to characterizing unique features of this cell subset and its responses, and to dissecting mechanisms regulating these cells in vivo.  (2) Induction and Cellular Sources of Innate Cytokines - They have shown that there is a plasticity of sources, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), for innate cytokines during challenges with infectious agents, and are beginning to reveal the interactions in place to sense and elicit the responses most beneficial under the conditions of particular infections.  (3) Cytokine Function in Health and Disease - They have demonstrated the role of innate cytokines in viral pathogenesis.  In addition, they have shown how in vivo conditions dramatically alter consequences of cytokine administration and of secondary challenges with other microbial products, and suggested mechanisms by which underlying subclinical infections can predispose to critical illness during bacterial infections.  The work has also identified interactions between the neuroendocrine and immune systems to regulate cytokine responses during viral infections.  (4) Unique Roles for, and Mechanisms Regulating Functions of, Type 1 Interferons (i.e., IFNalpha/beta) - They have demonstrated that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is required for certain, but negatively regulates other potential IFN-alpha/beta immunoregulatory effects, and that total STAT1 protein levels are dynamically regulated during the course of an endogenous viral infection with accompanying changes in type 1 IFN activation of another signaling molecule and consequences for CD8 T cell proliferation.  These observations suggest that endogenous pathways are in place to differentially regulate levels of individual signaling molecules to qualitatively modify downstream responses to cytokines.  Taken together, the laboratory's efforts are helping to shape a clear picture of mechanisms in place to promote the induction and function of innate immune responses, and are providing insights for therapeutic approaches to enhance health in the treatment of infections, cancers, and immunodeficiencies."

S'Joseph Bliss studies the fungal pathogen, <i>Candida</i>, and the role of antibody in host defense against this organism. Although the importance of cell-mediated immunity is well known, there is increasing evidence supporting a role for antibody in defense against <i>Candida</i> infections. Our work involves monoclonal antibody fragments directed against surface determinants of the organism that have been recently isolated and characterized. Current emphasis involves the identification of the cognate antigens recognized by these antibodies and the development of assays to evaluate their capacity to augment damage to the fungus by host effector mechanisms.<br /><br />The premature neonate is at particularly high risk for developing serious infections with <i>Candida</i>, and these infections carry a significant rate of mortality. The susceptibility of this population is due in part to the immaturity in the immune function of these patients. The mechanisms by which the neonate defends against fungal infection and the specific deficiencies that increase risk are poorly understood. We are using the antibodies and assays of immune function to investigate the development of immunity in the neonate and potentially develop novel immunotherapies for these patients at risk.'

S'My research is concerned with the biology and neurology of language and the processes involved in speaking and understanding. The research methodologies used in my lab include behavioral measures of aphasic patients correlated with structural measures of neuropathology and neural modeling and functional neuroimaging of normal subjects. <br /><br />RESEARCH IN APHASIA<br />My research in aphasia explores the effects of brain damage on normal language processing as a window into the neurological bases of language and the mechanisms contributing to normal language processing. The major focus of this research is on sound structure and the lexicon and the processing stages that map sound to meaning and meaning to sound. In particular, we are examining the effects of acoustic-phonetic, lexical, phonological, and semantic competition on the lexical processing of aphasic patients and investigating how higher level stages of lexical processing interact with and influence processing stages downstream from it. <br /><br />In investigating the mapping from sound to meaning, it is hypothesized that deficits should emerge for patients with lesions involving the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) under conditions of lexical and lexical-semantic competition, whereas deficits should emerge for patients with lesions including the supramarginal gyrus when competition is induced by phonological lexical density. Higher-level stages of processing from lexical semantics or sentence context should override processing deficits that emerge under conditions of lexical competition. <br /><br />In the investigations of the mapping from sound to meaning, we are exploring whether acoustic traces of the original target will emerge in the production of phonemic paraphasias. We are also exploring the extent to which neighborhood density influences the articulatory implementation of lexical targets.This influence should be overcome by the effects of higher-level lexical-semantic information. <br /><br />RESEARCH ON THE NEURAL SYSTEMS UNDERLYING SPEECH AND LEXICAL PROCESSING USING fMRI<br />The goals of this research are to understand the neural systems underlying the computational properties of speech perception and how the computational properties of the speech-lexical processing system map on to its neural substrate. <br /><br />Although there is general consensus that the functional role of anterior and posterior areas differ in the perception of speech &#151;  with posterior areas, e.g. transverse temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, involved in the sensory processing of the stimuli and anterior areas, e.g. inferior frontal gryus, involved in executive processes &#151; there is less consensus about the functional role of the two hemispheres. We intend to investigate whether the computational mechanisms of the two hemispheres preferentially process different properties of the speech signal. Our hypothesis is that the acoustic properties of speech will be preferentially processed by the left hemisphere irrespective of their acoustic structure, owing to the functional role that sound structure plays in language processing. Nonetheless, despite this left hemisphere preference, we hypothesize modulation of right hemisphere mechanisms as a function of the acoustic structure of the stimuli, with increased right hemisphere activation for acoustic properties that require fine spectral analysis and have a longer inherent duration. <br /><br />A series of experiments using both speech discrimination and phonetic categorization tasks are planned to examine activation patterns in the processing of a number of acoustic-phonetic parameters underlying both consonant and vowel perception. <br /><br />In addition, we plan to investigate the computational properties of the speech-lexical processing system. We are investigating whether the presence and extent of competition in the network (phonetic, phonological, lexical, and semantic) will have both behavioral and neural consequences. A series of experiments are investigating neural activation patterns under conditions of different types of competition including phonetic category competition, lexical competition, and semantic competition.'

S'The Politics of Ideas<br />Growing up in the UK under Mrs. Thatcher, the politics of ideas, that is, how politics alters agents\' conceptions of what they should want was always on the TV screen or on the front pages of the newspapers. Yet when I came to grad school in the US, the idea that how people think about the world may matter for how they act in it was treated with deep suspicion (and still is in some quarters). Here, interests - unproblematic, given and transitive -were the order of the day. I\'d like to think that my work has moved the debate along a bit in that regard. A few key publications in this area are:<br /><br />"Any More Bright Ideas? The Ideational Turn of Comparative Political Economy."<br />Comparative Politics 29 (1) January 1997 pp. 229-250.<br /><br />"The Transformation of the Swedish Model: Economic Ideas, Distributional Conflict and Institutional Change" World Politics 54 (1) October 2001 pp. 1-26.<br /><br />"Structures do not Come with an Instruction Sheet: Interests, Ideas and Progress in Political Science," Perspectives on Politics 1 (4), December 2003 pp. 695-703.<br /><br />"Beyond the Standard Model," in Robert Cox and Daniel Beland (eds.) Forthcoming in Robert Cox and Daniel Beland (eds.) Ideas and Politics in Social Science Research, Oxford University Press, 2010.<br /><br /><br />How Institutions Change<br />Part of my fascination with ideas, apart from trying to understand what made Mrs. Thatcher appealing to millions of people who were made worse off by her policies (if you don\'t believe me check the UK inequality stats) was a puzzle within the so-called \'new institutionalist\' literature in political science, which was all the rage when I was at grad school. Specifically, if people get their preferences from their institutional context, then where do they get the preference to change that context? My answers also have to do with ideas and can be found here:<br /><br />Great Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2002). <br /><br />"Domestic Institutions and the Possibility of Social Democracy" Comparative European Politics, 3 (4) December (2005) pp. 379-407.<br /><br />"When Liberalisms Change: Comparing the Politics of Deflations and Inflations," in Arthur T. Denzau, Thomas C. Willett, and Ravi K. Roy (eds.) Neoliberalism, National and Regional Experiments with Global Ideas  (London and New York: Routledge 2006)<br /><br />"Beyond the Usual Suspects: Ideas, Uncertainty, and Building Institutional Orders" Contribution to a special issue of International Studies Quarterly, 51 (4) December 2007 pp. 761-777.<br /><br />"The Secret Life of Institutions: On the Role of Ideas in Evolving Economic Systems"<br />Revue de la R&#233;gulation: Capitalisme, Institutions, Pouvoirs. n&#176;3/4, novembre 2008, pp: 1-11. <br /><br /><br />How Disciplines Change<br />Related to my work on how institutions change is how academic fields change. By this I mean the self-understandings academics have of their own work and how the fields of knowledge they are part of evolve and change over time. <br /><br />"The State of the Discipline in American Political Science: Be Careful What You Wish For?" British Journal of Politics and International Relations 1 (3) October 1999 pp. 345-365 (with Robin Varghese).<br /><br />"Great Punctuations: Prediction, Randomness, and the Evolution of Comparative Political Science" American Political Science Review 100 (4) November (2006) pp. 493-498.<br /><br />"An Approach to Comparative Analysis, or a Sub-Field Within a Sub-Field? Political Economy," in Mark Lichbach and Alan Zuckerman (eds.), Comparative Politics: Rationality, Culture, and Structure. Cambridge University Press, 2009. <br /><br />"Torn Between Two Lovers: Caught in the Middle of British and American IPE" New Political Economy, 14 (3) (2009): 329-336. <br /><br /><br />Political Parties<br />If my work on ideas (and institutions) was an attempt to work out what made Mrs. Thatcher possible, then my work on political parties was my attempt to understand what made Blair, Schroeder and Clinton possible. I never bought the line that \'globalization made them do it\' and instead sought answers within political parties themselves. Since parties are both institutions and agents they are particularly interesting. My research in this area continues in a joint project with Jonathan Hopkin of the LSE (http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hopkin/) and Riccardo Pellizzo at Griffith University (http://www.griffith.edu.au/business-commerce/centre-governance-public-policy/staff/riccardo-pelizzo) <br /><br />"Globalization and the Limits of Democratic Choice: Social Democracy and the Rise of Political Cartelization" Internationale Politik und Gesellschaft 6 (3) (July) 2003 pp. 60-82.<br /><br />"Domestic Institutions and the Possibility of Social Democracy" Comparative European Politics, 3 (4) December (2005) pp. 379-407.<br /><br />"Globalization Didn\'t Make You Do It! Understanding Social Democratic Party Choices" ("La Globalizzazione e il Mutamento della Social Democrazia") Meridiana - Rivista di Storia e Scienze Sociali Vol. 50-51 (2005) pp. 41-70. <br /><br />"From Catch all Politics to Cartelization: The Political Economy of the Cartel Party" Western European Politics Vol. 28 (1) January 2005, pp. 34-61 (with Richard S. Katz).<br /><br /><br />The Politics of Finance (and Governing Complex Systems)<br />Given the recent global financial crisis there has been an explosion of interest in this area. My interest here is a bit more longstanding. <br /><br />Following the dot-com burst and the demise of the hedge fund LTCM, and building upon my work in the politics of ideas where I use the distinction between risk and uncertainty a lot, I became interested in how banks and the like think about risk. And the more I looked into this the more worried I got. I published a piece back in 2003, which suggested that LTCM was just the beginning and that the way banks calculate risk was going to blow up the world. Nothing of the sort happened. So I guessed I was wrong about VaR and derivatives and went of to write about parties. And then the world blew up. <br /><br />I guess someone was reading my stuff on this because in 2008 I was invited to join the Warwick Commission on International Financial Reform that made a case for macro-prudential regulation. (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/report/) I am also interested in finance because it\'s a great example of how humans deal with complex systems&#133;badly - and given the level of general interest in this topic you get to write short pieces for non-academics, which is fun. <br /><br />"The Political Power of Financial Ideas: Transparency, Risk and Distribution in Global Finance" in Jonathan Kirshner (ed.) Monetary Orders (Cornell University Press 2003) pp. 239-259.<br /><br />"The Politics of Compounding Bubbles: The Global Housing Bubble in Comparative Perspective." Comparative European Politics, Fall 2008, pp. 387-406. <br /><br />"Re-Constructing IPE: Some Conclusions Drawn from a Crisis" in Abdelal, Blyth and Parsons, Constructing the International Economy, Ithaca: Cornell University Press 2010.<br /><br />"This Time It is Really Different: Europe, the Financial Crisis and Staying on Top in the Twenty-First Century" in Daniel Breznitz and John Zysman (eds.)

I recently co-edited Constructing the International Economy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press 2010), which surveys different versions of constructivist analysis. <br /><br />I also edited a textbook of sorts - The Routledge Handbook of International Political Economy: IPE as a Global Conversation (New York: Routledge Press 2009), which surveys different schools and sects of IPE around the globe. <br /><br />I am currently working on two books. One is an ever-evolving behemoth called The End of the Liberal World? that questions the political and economic sustainability of liberal democracies. <br /><br />The other, under contract at Oxford University Press, is entitled Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea, which interrogates the return to prominence of the ideas of financial orthodoxy following the global financial crisis.<br /><br />I have also published on subjects as diverse as the Varieties of Capitalism school, the film The Matrix, Nassim Taleb\'s idea of Black Swans, and how American school districts change as an example of institutional change, as can be seen in this CV found here. <br /><br />Forthcoming pieces on the efficiency/equality trade off, evolutionary theory and institutional change, and how the discipline of economics is responding to the crisis will be posted here as they come out.'

She is also the PI of an NIH-funded study to test the efficacy of yoga as a complementary therapy for individuals who are trying to quit smoking.  <br /><br />She is Chair of the Technology & Health Behavior research group at the Miriam Hospital Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine.  She is an Associate Editor for Health Psychology and the Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation. Dr. Bock serves as a member of an NIH study section (PRDP).<br /><br /><br />Selected Research Projects<br /><br />As Principal Investigator:<br /><br />Examining the Efficacy of Exercise Videogames for Physical Activity Adoption and Maintenance. (1R01HL109116).  This study is a 3-group randomized, controlled trial among healthy, sedentary adults testing the efficacy of exercise videogames (EVGs) compared to a standard exercise program (Standard) and a control condition.  Primary outcomes include time spent in weekly physical activity and changes in physical fitness and cardiovascular health.  Following an intensive, 12-week intervention, we will also examine maintenance of physical activity and fitness changes during a 6-month home based maintenance program (EVG and Standard interventions). This study will also examine changes in theoretically-based constructs that will shed light on the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms underlying observed between-group differences in adherence to PA.<br /><br />System-based Tracking and Treatment for Emergency Patients who Smoke: STTEPS. (R01CA156699) This is a translational study to develop and implement a tobacco treatment program following the US PHS guidelines by integrating intervention parameters into an existing electronic medical tracking software program that is widely used across the United States.  In this study we will adapt an existing Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) to facilitate the identification of smokers, prompt physician intervention, enhance the provision of smoking cessation intervention materials as discharge instructions, facilitate quit-smoking medication prescription and advice, and connect the patient to follow up care through their primary care provider and a pro-active telephone quit line. After full implementation of the EDIS system we will recruit a second patient cohort to examine the impact/efficacy and cost/efficacy of the system. Contemporaneous with the Step 1 and Step 2 cohorts, we will recruit two cohorts of smoking patients at a second (no intervention) ED site to control for historical trends. This study is a comprehensive systems-based translation of empirically supported tobacco treatment built upon a widely used patient tracking platform that maximizes the probability for a sustained, disseminable application of this intervention approach.<br /><br />Examining a Text Message Intervention for Smoking Cessation. (R21 DA027142; B. Bock, PI).  In this study we will develop and test the initial efficacy of a tailored smoking-cessation intervention delivered through text-messaging. <br /><br />Yoga for Women Attempting Smoking Cessation: An initial investigation. (R21AT003669; B. Bock, PI)<br />The goal of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of  yoga as a complementary treatment for  cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation.  Women smokers were provided with CBT and randomly assigned to receive either yoga or a contact control wellness program. Qualitative feedback, program adherence and feasibility data will be examined along with initial estimates of efficacy for smoking abstinence. <br /><br />Smoking Cessation in the Chest Pain Observation Unit.  (R01HL60986; B.Bock, PI). The primary goal of this project is to examine the existence of "the teachable moment" and the relative efficacy of two brief interventions for increasing smoking cessation rates among patients admitted to the observation unit with symptoms of chest pain. Patients admitted through the emergency department for 24-hour observation for chest pain are randomly assigned to receive either a motivationally tailored intervention or state-of-the-art care according to national tobacco treatment guidelines.<br /><br />Smoking Cessation in Emergency Respiratory Patients.  (R01 HL65595; B. Bock, PI).  This study expands investigation of the "teachable moment" and the factors which motivate smokers to quit. This study also tests the relative efficacy of two smoking cessation interventions among patients with acute respiratory illness being treated in an Emergency Department.

S'She is currently working on several topics in ancient Greek literature, history, and religion. One project is an overview of domestic religious practices (as opposed to the civic cults that are far more common subjects of investigation): prayers, offerings, imprecations, healing and fertility rites that were part of everyday life in a Greek household. She found these practices intersected with larger-scale civic cults in variety of ways, from competition to complementarity. In particular, household practices included areas of life that were excluded from public sanctuaries: birth, sexuality, and death. In trying to understand religion in ancient Greece, it is essential to consider the dynamic relationship between domestic and civic rites.<br /><br />A concurrent project focuses on a recently discovered fragment of the poorly preserved but fascinating poetic corpus of Sappho, who was so much admired in her own time that she was known as the "tenth Muse." The papyrus on which these lines were written is one of our very earliest manuscripts of ancient Greek literature. It includes a reflection on old age, which the speaker (Sappho herself?) squarely faces as inevitable for humans. Even Tithonus, the lover of the Dawn goddess and immortalized by her, grew old. The papyrus contains other poetic fragments as well; I argue that its contents raise fundamental questions about the transmission or publication of Sappho\'s songs in antiquity and their transformation into a corpus of written poems.<br /><br />For some time, she has been writing on the traditions that emerged concerning the defeat of the great Persian invasion of mainland Greece in the early 5th century BCE, generally conceded to be a major turning point in history. The events of this period inspired the first great work of historiography in the West, <i>Histories of Herodotus</i>, with its fascinating blend of oral history, analysis, and subtle patterning. Battles in the Persian Wars were also praised, and those who died in them were lamented, in highly poetic accounts, almost as if they were on a par with the legendary Trojan War of the distant past. Rituals emerged to commemorate the war dead in various Greek city-states, and battle sites like Marathon or Plataea became \'places of memory,\' linked for many centuries with the defining events that happened there. Commemoration, however, takes many forms; currently she is working on Greek accounts, in prose and poetry, that find fault with some of the heroes of the Persian Wars, especially the brilliant Athenian strategist Themistocles.'

Her work has since 1982 involved the ongoing  excavation of the abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes in Soissons, France, the Cistercian  monastery of Notre Dame d'Ourscamp and the Carthusian charterhouse at Bourgfontaine. Her research considers not only the buildings of these monasteries, but also their landed domains, hydraulic resources and  interactions with the larger urban and rural landscape. She has also published on the role of the individual within the monastic corporation, on  early modern monasticism and monastic texts, and on the interactions between liturgy and architecture. She has worked extensively with computer graphic solutions for archaeological recording and architectural reconstructions, and with text encoding of monastic texts to create searchable databases for research.<br /><br />She has also studied the reuse and reoccupation of Roman architecture in southern France during the Middle Ages. Her work aims to change past approaches to classical revival not only by including architecture more centrally, but by considering more fully the importance of the site itself. It also considers more critically issues of art historical theory as they relate to classicism and the medieval uses of the past. One aspect of this research, an examination of the female monastic community of Saint-Sauveur-de-la-Font, installed in the Roman 'temple of Diana,' has appeared in print.<br /><br />Recent work funded by the NSF has also been devoted to research on ethical decision-making, and on the ethics of re-presentation."

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays a critical role in adipogenesis. We are investigating novel signal transduction pathways used by IGF-I to mediate proliferation and differentation of adipocytes in vitro.  Our previous work identified Src as a critical mediator of IGF-I-activated Shc and MAPK in preadipocyte proliferation. We demonstrated that loss of Src-activated MAPK occurs with growth arrest, thus allowing IGF-I to promote adipocyte differentiation through the IRS/PI3K/AKT pathway. We have identified a novel, multi-protein signaling complex including integrins and the focal adhesion kinase Pyk2 that mediates IGF-I action in proliferation. Ongoing studies will determine the mechanism of IGF-I activation of integrins and assembly of the multi-protein complex in preadipocyte proliferation; in addition, studies will elucidate the complex change in signaling that occurs at growth arrest involving loss of mitogenic signaling and modification of IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling required for adipocyte differentiation.'

S'My research program involves developing theory-based health behavior interventions to proactively reach those who would not spontaneously seek, or have access to treatment.  I believe that population-based health behavior change can occur by targeting 4 areas:  1) developing new channels to proactively reach those who are most at risk; 2) developing new methods of intervention; particularly tailored to those who are not motivated to change, 3) attention to both treatment outcomes and theoretical mechanisms of change, and 4) institutionalization of effective interventions.  <br /><br />My research also involves cultural adaptation of evidenced based interventions.  I have developed a model that outlines the criteria and methods for developing and testing interventions with special populations.  This is published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 2010.<br /><br />One of my  primary areas of research is to motivate smoking cessation among medical populations  through Motivational Enhancement methods (e.g., Motivational Interviewing) and augmentation of risk perception through biomarker feedback.  I have conducted a series of studies involving motivating smoking cessation and second hand smoke reduction among caregivers of children with asthma.  These interventions captilize on a teachable moment (e.g., recent visit to the emergency room) using biomarker feedback to increase perception of risk.  This series of interventions was culturally adapted for Latino smokers, and shown to have efficacy in this population.<br /><br />My most recent research involves using Behavioral Activation to motivate smoking cessation in smokers with mobility impairments. The first phase of this project involves using both qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as community based participatory research, to develop a series of theory-based videos to motivate smoking cessation and increase empowerment.  The second phase of this research involved testing these videos in a randomized controlled trial to determine whether or not they are effective in promoting smoking cessation in this population.  <br /><br />I have extrapolated my treatment models to health domains outside of smoking, including colon cancer screening, oral health, asthma, medication adherence, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) adherence, depression, obesity, diet, exercise, and diabetes.  I have also applied motivational interviewing and health behavior change methods to diverse populations (Disabled, Native Americans, Latinos, Inner city, older adults, pediatrics, adolescents).  <br /><br />A separate line of study involves developing and publishing guidelines on treatment fidelity of health behavior change studies. I co-chaired on NIH committee on treatment fidelity in order to develop these guidelines.  These guidelines are viewed as supplementary to CONSORT for behavioral health interventions and are published in Health Psychology and the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, the latter includes an assessment tool for researchers on treatment fidelity.

S"Over the past ten years, Dr. Borsari has worked to develop a research program in implementing and evaluating secondary interventions with college student drinkers. Specifically, he has implemented brief motivational interventions with students who have begun to experience problems as a result of their alcohol use. Specifically, colleges and universities have seen a large increase in the number of students referred to the administration for violation of alcohol policies. However, the wide range in the severity of offenses indicates that the majority of mandated students may not require extensive treatment. He believes that stepped care, which assigns individuals to different levels of care according to treatment response, would maximize treatment efficiency and greatly reduce the demands on campus alcohol programs. Regarding intervention-level analyses, Dr. Borsari is also investigating the in-session components of individual interventions that may be linked to subsequent behavior change (e.g., the working alliance).<br /><br />In addition to his work with college students, Dr. Borsari's appointment at the Providence VAMC allows him to conduct clinical work and research in a wide range of areas.

S'&#149; My current research focuses on the political dimension of literary art in the courts of France, England, Italy, and Spain between 1250-1550. I examine the methods book collectors employed to pilfer valuable manuscripts and use them for cultural and political profit during the period of the Hundred Years War, with an emphasis on English, French and Burgundian nobles and warriors who were also bibliophiles. The political and social turmoil of war spurred various highhanded forms of book procurement. These forms include: <br />(1) battle spoils and looting--the book as a war trophy; <br />(2) books borrowed and deliberately not returned to their rightful owners; <br />(3) coerced sales, in which the victor purchases manuscripts at ridiculously low prices; <br />(4) the confiscation and punitive seizure of books. <br />As part of this project, I also examine countermeasures attempted against these practices: for example, the tactics used by the victims or their heirs in order to retrieve--or "ransom"--their lost treasures. Manuscripts pertinent to my study are located in several libraries, such as the Biblioth&#232;que nationale de France, the Biblioth&#232;que Sainte-Genevi&#232;ve, the British Library, and the Nottingham University Library. <br /><br />&#149; In addition, I also have a book manuscript in preparation on the thirteenth-century troubadour Guiraut Riquier: a study of the semi-autobiographical plot lines embedded in his song-book (chansonnier).

S'Pharmacology and medicinal chemistry of sigma receptors and opioid receptors<br /><br />Sigma receptors as therapeutic and diagnostic targets.<br /><br />Sigma receptors and drug-induced apoptosis.<br /><br />Signal transduction mechanisms in receptor-mediated apoptosis and regulation of cell proliferation.<br /><br />Small molecule drug design.<br /><br /><br />    My general interests have centered on biochemical mechanisms involved in the action of opiate drugs, opioid peptides, and related compounds.  Current research in this laboratory is directed at elucidation of the structure and function of sigma receptors.  Sigma receptors (formerly classified as opioid receptors) are membrane-bound proteins that recognize several important classes of psychotropic drugs, including antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol, the psychotomimetic agent phencyclidine (PCP), some synthetic opiates such as pentazocine, and some psychostimulants like cocaine.  Sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor subtypes are currently known, and likely comprise a novel receptor family distinct from any known neurotransmitter or hormone receptor system.  Both subtypes are present in the CNS as well as in peripheral tissues, and are expressed in high density in a number of neuronal and non-neuronal tumor cell lines.  No endogenous ligands for these receptors have yet been clearly identified, although there is existing evidence for such substances and progesterone and other neurosteroids have been shown to interact with sigma-1 receptors.<br /><br />     Most work in our laboratory currently focuses on the possible role of sigma-2 receptors in regulation of cell proliferation and survival.  We have found that chronic activation of sigma-2 receptors induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types.  We are investigating the signaling mechanisms leading to the induction of cell death, and have found that these mechanisms are cell type-specific.  For example, in breast tumor cells, apoptosis occurs via a novel mechanism that is both caspase- and p53-independent, whereas in a neuroblastoma line, cell death is dependent on caspase 8/10 activation.  Signaling involves both transient and sustained changes in cytosolic calcium levels.  We are interested in determining the mechanisms of calcium flux and the downstream effects of these calcium signals.  Signaling also involves changes in cellular sphingolipids (ceramides and lysosphingolipids).  Sphingolipids are involved in myriad cellular processes including cell survival, regulation of ion channels, and cell-cell recognition.  Lysosphingolipids act via specific G-protein coupled receptors on the cell surface, as well as through certain intracellular targets, and ceramides are known to modulate the activity of various protein kinases and phosphatases involved in cell growth.  We are investigating the role of sphingolipid signaling in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and how this system interfaces with sigma-2 receptors.  Also under investigation are effects of sigma-2 receptor activation on mitochondria.  Apoptosis in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types appears to be dependent on loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors.  The roles of mitochondrial pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are under study.  Finally, the sigma-2 receptor, a 21.5 kDa lipid raft protein, has not yet been cloned.  We have projects underway aimed at purifying sigma-2 receptor proteins, obtaining protein sequence information, and using this information to clone the sigma-2 receptor gene.<br /><br />     The sigma-1 receptor has been cloned and is a 25 kDa polypeptide with two putative transmembrane domains.  In contrast to sigma-2 receptors, activation of sigma-1 receptors appears to exert protective and perhaps trophic effects on neurons and other cell types.  Others have shown that activation of sigma-1 receptors potentiates neurite outgrowth in culture, whereas we have shown that activation of sigma-2 receptors causes neurite retraction.  Blockade of sigma-1 receptors by selective antagonists or antisense deoxyoligonucleotides has been shown to block the toxic effects of cocaine, a psychotropic agent that binds to sigma-1 receptors.  Furthermore, sigma-1 receptor activation in the hippocampus has a cognitive enhancing effect.  We have initiated structure-function studies of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.  Sigma-1 receptors regulate calcium signaling by amplifying release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to the rise in IP3 via GPCR activation.  The sigma-1 receptor appears to signal solely by protein-protein interactions.  The liganded receptor binds to ankyrin in the ER membrane and relieves a tonic inhibition of the IP3 receptor that is imparted by its interaction with ankyrin.  We have shown that stable overexpression of sigma-1 receptors induces a constitutive activation of the IP3 receptor in human MCF-7 breast tumor cells, which are normally devoid of sigma-1 receptors.  Furthermore, studies using various receptor constructs showed that only the C-terminal segment of the receptor is required for this effect.  We are further delineating the functional domains of the receptor.  Furthermore, cells overexpressing active sigma-1 constructs proliferate more rapidly than untransfected cells and have a survival advantage.  We are investigating the signaling mechanisms that are involved in inducing what appears to be a more highly aggressive phenotype.  The studies suggest that the sigma-1 receptor could be a biomarker for assessing proliferative status of tumor cells.<br /><br />     We are involved in the design and synthesis of novel small molecule ligands for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors.  Since the natural ligand(s) is unknown and many existing sigma ligands interact with other receptors, selective synthetic probes for sigma receptors are necessary.  Through close collaboration with medicinal chemists, we have developed and are continuing to develop highly selective receptor agonists and antagonists for use as tools to study receptor function.  We are interested in elucidating the structural features of ligands that determine binding affinity, impart subtype selectivity, and that specify agonist/antagonist properties.  Some of these compounds may have clinical potential as therapeutic agents.<br /><br />     Studies of sigma receptors will shed light on novel modes for regulation of cell proliferation and survival.  It may be possible to target sigma-2 receptors with agonists or sigma-1 receptors with antagonists to induce apoptosis in tumors rendered drug-resistant due to acquisition of mutations in key components of the classical apoptotic pathway, such as p53 and caspases.  Sigma receptors in the CNS could conceivably play a role in neurodegenerative disorders.  Furthermore, since typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol activate sigma-2 receptors, these studies may have important implications for treatment of psychiatric disorders with respect to the debilitating motor side effects induced by these agents.'

S"Wayne Bowen's interest in chemistry started while he was in elementary school.  He liked to raid the medicine cabinet, bringing a stash of pills, powders and syrups to his bedroom, where he would mix them to make new concoctions.  This hobby landed him in some trouble, but he tells us that it is also how he got his first chemistry set.  <br /><br />Today he studies a complex field that combines chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and neuroscience.  He is a nationally recognized leader in research on sigma receptors&#151;proteins in the brain and in tissues like the liver and kidney that are believed to regulate cell survival and growth.   His major areas of interest include biochemical mechanisms involved in the neuronal action of opiate drugs, and the biochemistry of sigma receptors in cancer cells and in the brain.  Sigma receptors bind to antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of common disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.  Finding out how to block and stimulate these proteins could help scientists create safer, more effective psychotropic drugs.  Sigma receptors have implications for cancer as well.  Activating their cell-destroying powers may help stamp out cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy.<br /><br />Bowen received his B.S. in chemistry from Morgan State College in 1974, and completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry and neurobiology at Cornell University in 1981.  He then spent three years as a Postdoctoral Staff Fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where he studied opiate receptor biochemistry.  He initially came to Brown University in 1983 when he taught endocrinology, introductory biology, and biochemistry and founded the macromolecular biochemistry facility&#151;a one-man lab that supplied synthetic peptides to scientists throughout the campus and affiliated hospitals. <br /><br />In 1991, Bowen returned to the NIH to take a position at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, where he became chief of the Unit on Receptor Biochemistry and Pharmacology in the Drug Design and Synthesis Section of the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry.  He also served as president of the NIH Black Scientists Association in 2001.<br /><br />However, Bowen never really left Brown University.  During his time at NIH, he would return every fall to deliver neuroscience lectures to undergraduate students.  In 2004, Bowen returned permanently to the Brown faculty as Professor of Biology in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology, and Biotechnology in the Division of Biology and Medicine.  He co-directs the Medical School's pharmacology course and teaches in the endocrinology and neuroscience courses to undergraduates.  He plans to create a course on small-molecule drug design.<br /><br />Bowen has confided that he is happy to get back to teaching and working with students in the laboratory. Teaching is not a solitary pursuit; it connects him with students who are excited and curious.  This connection with his students keeps him close to the thrill of discovery&#151;the beating heart of science.<br /><br />(Modified from an article written by Wendy Lawton for the Brown News Service, August 15, 2004)"

Also, antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol damage neurons via sigma-2 receptors.  Blocking sigma-2 receptors might prevent the irreversible motor side effects caused by typical neuroleptic agents.'

S'These are exciting times in the field of vertebrate morphology. Imaging technologies such as high-resolution CT scanning, MRI, and laser scanning confocal microscopy are opening up vast worlds of cross-sectional and three-dimensional anatomy. In functional morphology and biomechanics, new tools for micrometry, force measurement, 3D flow visualization, 3D motion capture, and mathematical modeling are providing ever more sophisticated understandings of the interactions between morphology and environment. Studies of vertebrate functional morphology, biomechanics, paleontology, and development are poised at the edge of a revolution in our ability to capture and quantify complex morphology and function in 4D (3 spatial dimensions plus time), and to integrate our understandings of function, development, and evolution. <br /><br />With my colleagues in the vertebrate morphology group at Brown, we are currently developing a 3D x-ray technology for visualizing rapid skeletal movement. This new technology, "<a href="http://www.xromm.org">X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM)</a>" combines static 3D data from CT scans with skeletal movement data from high-speed x-ray videos. <a href="http://www.xromm.org">XROMM</a> produces highly accurate 3D animations of skeletal elements moving in space. These are more than stick figures--the complete 3D morphology of each bone is present and animated precisely with this technique. <a href="http://www.xromm.org">XROMM</a> makes it possible to study many aspects of skeletal kinematics, such as long axis rotation of bones, putative bending of fine bones in small animals, and the relative 3D motions of the articular surfaces of joints that are inaccessible with other techniques. In addition, <a href="http://www.xromm.org">XROMM</a> provides more accurate data for input into musculoskeletal models, such as joint angles for inverse dynamics and neural control models. <br /><br />Faculty and students in our group are currently using <a href="http://www.xromm.org">XROMM</a> to study jaw movement and temporomandibular joint function in pigs, joint and muscle forces in jumping frogs, feeding in ducks, and foot ligament strain during locomotion in pigs.'

S'My second book, <i>The Ethics of Voting</i>, under contract with Princeton University Press, inquires into when it is right and wrong for citizens to vote, and how they should vote if they do.  This book challenges commonsense and popular philosophical views of voting ethics.  I argue that citizens typically have no moral obligation to vote.  However, if they do vote, they must vote well--on the basis of sound moral and empirical beliefs in order to promote the common good--or otherwise they are morally obligated to abstain.  <br /><br />My first book, <i>A Brief History of Liberty</i> (with David Schmidtz), forthcoming from Blackwell in 2009, concerns the meaning and value of liberty.  In particular, we look to go beyond the armchair and try to see what lessons history can teach us.  On our view, the word "liberty" refers to a cluster of related things, each of which people have reasonably fought for.  The important questions about liberty are not so much about meaning, but about institutions.  Which institutions have tended to promote or demote liberty, and what good and bad has that done for people?<br /><br />I\'m also interested in civic virtue.  Modern liberal theories of civic virtue tend to try to incorporate "classical republican" ideals.  Instead, I want to develop the idea that a good society doesn\'t require us or even need us all to be political animals.  If civic virtue is about acting with a concern to promote the common good, we can recognize that there are many non-political ways of promoting this good.  We recieve a bundle of political, economic, social, and cultural goods from society, and this leads many to think we have a debt to pay.  On my view, if we have debts to pay to society, we can pay them through multiple currencies.  Perhaps you pay yours by promoting good governance, someone else by providing good culture, and a third by providing economic opportunity.  Some related issues I\'m interested in include whether we have a duty to work, or a duty to vote, or, even, <i>not</i> to vote.'

S'When the State Speaks, What Should it Say?<br />How Democracies Can Protect Expression and Promote Equality<br />(Princeton University Press, 2012)<br /><br />How should a liberal democracy respond to hate groups and others that oppose the ideal of free and equal citizenship? The democratic state faces the hard choice of either protecting the rights of hate groups and allowing their views to spread, or banning their views and violating citizens\' rights to freedoms of expression, association, and religion. Avoiding the familiar yet problematic responses to these issues, political theorist Corey Brettschneider proposes a new approach called value democracy. The theory of value democracy argues that the state should protect the right to express illiberal beliefs, but the state should also engage in democratic persuasion when it speaks through its various expressive capacities: publicly criticizing, and giving reasons to reject, hate-based or other discriminatory viewpoints. <br /><br />Distinguishing between two kinds of state action&#151;expressive and coercive&#151;Brettschneider contends that public criticism of viewpoints advocating discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation should be pursued through the state\'s expressive capacities as speaker, educator, and spender. When the state uses its expressive capacities to promote the values of free and equal citizenship, it engages in democratic persuasion. By using democratic persuasion, the state can both respect rights and counter hateful or discriminatory viewpoints. Brettschneider extends this analysis from freedom of expression to the freedoms of religion and association, and he shows that value democracy can uphold the protection of these freedoms while promoting equality for all citizens.<br /><br /><br />Democratic Rights<br />The Substance of Self-Government  <br />(Princeton University Press, 2007)<br /><a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691149305/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&seller=">Democratic Rights on Amazon</a><br /><br />When the Supreme Court in 2003 struck down a Texas law prohibiting homosexual sodomy, it cited the right to privacy based on the guarantee of "substantive due process" embodied by the Constitution. But did the court act undemocratically by overriding the rights of the majority of voters in Texas? Scholars often point to such cases as exposing a fundamental tension between the democratic principle of majority rule and the liberal concern to protect individual rights. Democratic Rights challenges this view by showing that, in fact, democracy demands many of these rights.<br /><br />Corey Brettschneider argues that ideal democracy is comprised of three core values--political autonomy, equality of interests, and reciprocity--with both procedural and substantive implications. These values entitle citizens not only to procedural rights of participation (e.g., electing representatives) but also to substantive rights that a "pure procedural" democracy might not protect. What are often seen as distinctly liberal substantive rights to privacy, property, and welfare can, then, be understood within what Brettschneider terms a "value theory of democracy." Drawing on the work of John Rawls and deliberative democrats such as J&#252;rgen Habermas, he demonstrates that such rights are essential components of--rather than constraints on--an ideal democracy. Thus, while defenders of the democratic ideal rightly seek the power of all to participate, they should also demand the rights that are the substance of self-government.'

This work examines both single crystals and polycrystals and considers the formation of the initial dislocation structure and the organization of this structure into cells or tangles. This research also considers the texture that can develop in a material after extensive deformation or after recrystallization of a worked material.<br /><br />Another important factor in the study of the deformation is the strain rate. Equipment is available in Professor Briant's laboratory to test samples at strain rates between 0.1 ms to 3000/s.<br /><br />Finally, Professor Briant has a keen interest in the environmental cracking of metals.

S'My first research project (2000-2003), funded by a Fulbright-Hayes grant and supported by a number of other granting agencies, involved a reevaluation of cosmopolitanism through the case of Turkish Jewry. <br /><br />The findings of this research, in addition to being published in a number of journals and edited volumes in print and under review, are forthcoming with Indiana University Press (anticipated publication date of 2011) in the first English-language ethnographic monograph about Turkish Jewry, tentatively entitled "Inside Tolerance: Jewish Life in Turkey in the 21st Century." Drawing on ethnographic and archival research, this book takes an inside look at what it means to be tolerated in the 21st century, describing Jewish life in Istanbul in rich detail. In addition to offering a description of a little-studied Jewish population, this study offers a new understanding of cosmopolitanism that, counter to many popular theories, does not see cosmopolitanism as tied to public nomination, but rather as knowledge and management of difference. The manuscript was recently awarded a Cahnman Publication Subvention Grant from the Association for Jewish Studies (2009).<br /><br />My current project, \'God is Not a Racist: Talking about Law, Religion and Secularism in  Britain,\' takes up the following question: Do secularists speak a different language than the pious? The apparent incommensurability of secular and pious language is regularly invoked as debates rage across Europe about church sex scandals, veils, religious courts, animal slaughter, minaret construction and blasphemous cartoons. In descriptions of multiculturalism\'s failure, one hears the refrain that secularists and pious folks belong to different cultures (or civilizations) that clash when their worldviews are "lost in translation." While scholars have challenged the cultural translation metaphor, it still persists in academia and on the street despite lack of empirical evidence to support its validity. The goal of this study is to train an ethnographic lens on the way people actually talk about secularism and religion. I hypothesize that multicultural society does not have a translation problem; rather, the "lost in translation" metaphor allows adversarial groups to cling to an ideology of miscommunication because they don\'t want to listen to other people\'s talk.<br /><br />To test the "lost in translation" metaphor against the actual speech of cross-cultural communicators, I rely on sociolinguistic and ethnographic methods, exploring arenas in which secular and pious actors engage in enduring dialogue. As sites of secularist drama where representation and responsibility intersect, the court and the theatre provide us with ample linguistic material through which to chart the meanings of secularism (and piety). <br /><br />I begin by reexamining legal decisions from four recent Supreme Court cases concerning religion (Catholic agencies and gay adoption, Jewish schools\' admissions criteria, Muslim veiling and Hindu cremations). Following a tradition of critical discourse analysis, I consider these transcripts evidence of collaborative linguistic and social relationships between actors and institutions. The project\'s ethnographic analysis records talk by British stakes-holders in the religion-secularism question outside of court. Selected because of their demonstrated cross-genre communication, sites for participant-observation in London include: an advocacy group fighting European religious tribunals; meetings of an interfaith group; tribunal play performances (and post-show "talkbacks") and lectures on religion and theatre hosted by major British theatre company.  Unlike European countries with an explicit commitment to la&#239;cit&#233;, Britain, with "[&#133;] relaxed and fumbling accommodations"  to the separation of Church and state (Taylor in Michalski 2006), is an ideal site for this study.<br /><br />Studying religious/secular communication styles allows us to better understand powerful ideas about what "talk" is for in multicultural society (Katriel 2004). Anthropology offers this project tools to chart talk about secularism and religion, but a methodological focus on how Britons talk -in court and onstage- has important implications beyond pure linguistic analysis; it can offer ethnographic evidence of the role Europe\'s citizens attribute to religion and secularism in today\'s multicultural states.'

S'Trained as a cultural anthropologist (Ph.D., Stanford University 2005), I study the role of language and symbolism in the formation and maintenance of social groups, communities and nations. I most recently conducted ethnographic research with the Jewish community of Turkey, where I focused on issues of minority citizenship, language use and cosmopolitanism. My current project looks at legal discourses about minority citizenship elsewhere in Europe by studying the language generated by and around legal trials concerning religious symbols or practices taken to conflict with those understood as hegemonic by the state, this project looks at the way minorities function in society, how religion and secularism are imagined and, ultimately, what relationships exist between the state and its citizens.'

S'Brock\'s research has sought to develop a complete picture of the geometry and topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, namely, 3-dimensional spaces that admit expanding geometry as opposed to our more familiar Euclidean or flat geometry.  In the 1970s, William Thurston gave a conjectural classification of such manifolds in terms of their topology and certain pieces of asymptotic data called ending laminations.  Brock\'s recent collaboration with R. Canary (Michigan) and Y. Minsky (Yale) solved this conjecture, the so-called <i>ending lamination conjecture</i>, and led to the classification of all hyperbolic 3-manifolds with infinite volume and finite topological type.  These results were described in the recent article <A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/306/5705/2182">Taming the Hyperbolic Jungle by Pruning its Unruly Edges</A> in <i>Science (2004)</i>, by Dana Mackenzie.<br /><br />Brock\'s more recent research has sought to employ the techniques used in the solution to the ending lamination conjecture to develop a more complete understanding of the geometry and structure of finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds, which account for most compact 3-manifolds.  It appears that the effective geometric estimates obtained in the infinite volume case lead to a new way to tie together geometric features of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds with more classical topological invariants that have been the lifeblood of the field for many years.'

S"Jeffrey Brock's research focuses on low-dimensional geometry and topology, particularly on spaces with hyperbolic geometry (the most prevalent kind of non-Euclidean geometry).  His recent joint work with R. Canary and Y. Minsky resulted in a solution to the `ending lamination conjecture' of W. Thurston, giving a kind of classification theorem for hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds that are topologically finite in terms of certain pieces of `mathematical DNA' called laminations.  He received his undergraduate degree in mathematics at Yale University and his Ph.D. in mathematics from U.C. Berkeley, where he studied under Curtis McMullen. After holding postdoctoral positions at Stanford University and the University of Chicago, he came to Brown as an associate professor.  He was awarded the Donald D. Harrington Faculty Fellowship to visit the University of Texas, and has had continuous National Science Foundation support since receiving his Ph.D.  He was recently awarded a John S.

In a recent result of Brock with his collaborators, such models were used to classify all 'hyperbolic' three-dimensional spaces of infinite volume.  This result solved the long-standing conjecture of W. Thurston that a certain piece of 'mathematical DNA' for a space determines its structure."

S'Cynthia Brokaw focuses her research on the history of the book in China from the late sixteenth century through the early twentieth century&#151;that is, from the beginnings of the great boom in woodblock publishing that marked the late Ming through the Qing dynasty into the early twentieth century, when woodblock publishing was in decline.  Printing and Book Culture in Late Imperial China (University of California Press, 2005), a volume of essays she co-edited with Kai-wing Chow, was one of the first works in English to explore this relatively new field within Chinese studies.  Commerce in Culture: The Sibao Book Trade in the Qing and Republican Periods (Harvard University Asia Center, 2007) is a study of an important regional publishing industry, centered in the hinterland of southeastern China, and its role on the spread of book culture throughout south China from the late seventeenth through the early twentieth centuries.  Based on archival work and extensive field work in the two villages that formed the core of this industry, this work examines the text-production process in Sibao, traces the networks of itinerant book-selling and bookstores through which Sibao texts were distributed, and describes the wide range of texts&#151;primers and textbooks, ritual handbooks, medical manuals, fortune-telling guides, poetry collections, novels, and so forth&#151;that these rural publishers produced.  Through the dissemination of these books, the Sibao publisher-booksellers were acting as agents of cultural integration, disseminating the core texts of Chinese culture to poor county seats, interior market towns, and isolated peasant villages. <br /><br />Her current project, "Book Culture on the Qing Frontier: Publishing in Sichuan, 17th-20th Centuries" examines the spread of commercial publishing and Chinese book culture to the southwestern frontier of the Qing empire.  This project has several goals. First, it maps the transmission of printing technologies and textual knowledge from the established publishing centers in the southeast coastal areas to the frontiers of late imperial China. Second, it expands our understanding of the structure of publishing businesses and the variety in production forms in the late imperial period; and of the relationship between the older forms of printing and publishing (woodblock and movable type) and the modern printing technologies (lithography and letter-press) introduced in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Third, by analyzing the range of texts published (and the reading publics they attracted), it allows us to draw conclusions about the spread of literacy and the role that print had in cultural integration and the forging of a shared Chinese identity. Finally, an examination of the publication of Tibetan texts (particularly texts of Tantric Buddhism) in western Sichuan (Derge) will illuminate the role that non-Han texts played both in the construction of the multi-ethnic Qing imperium and in the confirmation of a distinctive Chinese cultural identity under the Republic.'

Her current research focus is the history of the book in China.  Commerce in Culture: The Sibao Book Trade in the Qing and Republican Periods, based on archival and field work in China, is a study of a rural book publishing industry active in distributing popular texts throughout south China.

S'(NK) cells provide early innate immune recognition and cytolytic response through granule-mediated killing. Additionally, NK cells secrete direct anti-viral as well as immune regulatory cytokines and chemokines, which can promote non-cytolytic pathogen targeting as well as enhance the cytolytic mechanisms and modulate subsequent immune functions. Their rapid activation has become a hallmark of their potency as innate immune system effectors, positioning NK cells as vital players in viral defense. Furthermore, during the response to infectious agents, changes in receptor expression patterns strongly suggest a critical role for activating and inhibitory receptors in the proper regulation of NK cells. We recently demonstrated that the Killer Lectin-Like Receptor G1 (KLRG1) is induced on NK cells during NK cell activation and that NK cell functions can be inhibited by KLRG1. KLRG1 molecule is a recently described C-type lectin inhibitory receptor expressed on resting NK cells and memory T cells. Determination of the precise role of KLRG1 molecule in regulating NK and T cell functions is actively investigated in the laboratory.<br /><br />Initiation and propagation of the immune response is the result of a series of coordinated cellular and biochemical interactions that lead to the activation of multiple cell types.  It is now clear that an optimal immune response requires a precise and rapid communication between different cell subsets. This phenomenon, referred to as cross-talk, is believed to be an essential component of the immune response that provides necessary inflammatory mediators and cytolytic activity for controlling infections and diseases. An example of an effective cooperation between different cell types has been recently illustrated by the finding that specific activation of CD1 restricted NK T cells can quickly lead to the activation of other subsets of cells such as NK and CD8 T cells. We are currentlypursuing studies focused on elucidating the mechanism of communication between activated NK T cells and NK cells during viral infection. Modulation of the immune function of these cells could have important implications for the generation of an appropriate immune response to pathogens.'

He is committed to collaborative research and learning that involves scholars and practitioners working in different professions and academic disciplines.<br /><br />His research into how different communities construct history in Macedonia, Greece, and Bulgaria led to his book <i>The Past in Question: Modern Macedonia and the Uncertainties of Nation,</i> as well as a number of articles on the culture, history, and politics of Macedonia. He is engaged on long-term research on the interaction between political activism and labor migration, and is currently completing a book on the role of terrorism in the Macedonian revolutionary movements of the early twentieth century, based on the Evans-Pritchard lectures he delivered at All Souls College, Oxford. <br />At the Watson Institute, he established the interdisciplinary Muabet project, which brings together scholars and practitioners to reflect on the dynamics of international intervention in the former Yugoslavia. This work led to the edited volume <i>Transacting Transition: The Micropolitics of Democracy Assistance in the Former Yugoslavia,</i> as well as a series of other publications tracking U.S. initiatives to foster the development of civil society in the region.  Most recently, in a project involving civil society practitioners and activists, Brown undergraduates and Macedonian film-makers, he has been conducting oral historical research to track one USAID-funded civil society program from idea to impact. <br />In 2004-5, in collaboration with colleagues at Brown and the Naval War College, Newport, Brown launched the Watson Institute\'s research project on the phenomenon of military cultural awareness, exploring in particular the linkages between U.S. experience in the Balkans and interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the interplay of doctrine and experience in the evolution of counter-insurgency as a field of study and practice.  Committed to facilitating dialogue between constituencies, the Institute has twice hosted the American Anthropological Association\'s commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the U.S. Security & Intelligence Communities, as well as the conference "Front Line, First Person: Iraq War Stories."<br /><br />Beyond this research, Brown also seeks to bring the methods and perspectives of socio-cultural anthropology to hear on pressing global issues through innovative teaching.  He is currently collaborating with Ian Cook, a geographer based at the University of Bristol, to encourage undergraduates to explore the social, cultural and economic lives of everyday things and to ask whether and to what extent knowledge of their production and distribution processes drives new forms of social identity, belonging and empathy.<br /><br />Since July 2010, Brown has served as director of the Brown International Advanced Research Institutes (BIARI).'

S'Born and raised in the Netherlands, Dr. Bruggeman received his B.Sc. in Human Movement Sciences from Vrije Universiteit (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). He then obtained a position as a visiting scholar at the University of Minnesota with Professor Gordon Legge. In Minnesota he became a graduate student at the Department of Psychology completing his Ph.D. in Cognitive and Biological Psychology in 2004. His dissertation research, under the supervision of Professor Herbert Pick, addressed issues of visual-motor adaptation. As a paradigm he used learning to throw on a rotating carousel; very similar to that featured on Science@NASA. Following his graduate work, Hugo became a post doctoral fellow at Brown University, collaborating with Professor Bill Warren to study the perceptual control of locomotion. He currently holds an Assistant Professor of Research position at Brown University. His research interests continue to evolve and, since recently, also include computational vision (in collaboration with Professor Fulvio Domini).'

My research goal is to better understand the roles of perception, learning and cognition in regulating movement and action. Three interests form the main drive of my studies. I want to better understand: (1) the use of "visual strategies" in guiding and calibrating movement and action; (2) how actions are organized to enable us to achieve our goals even when we perform an action in a new way or under unfamiliar conditions; and (3) the processes involved in perceiving the spatial structure of our surroundings.'

S'My first book, "A Familiar Strangeness: American Fiction and the Language of Photography," examined how the invention of the camera transformed the way American writers conceived of the limits and purpose of representation. Arguing for the centrality of photography to a set of writers commonly thought of as hostile to the camera&#151;including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston, and Gertrude Stein&#151;my book traced the photographic metaphors and allusions to the medium which appear throughout these writers\' work. My essays have explored topics such as narrative identification in the novels of Raymond Chandler, servants in the work of Henry James, national identity in Willa Cather\'s "The Professor\'s House," the anti-photographic aesthetic of James Agee\'s "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men," and desire in Luchino Visconti\'s "Death in Venice."<br /><br /> I am currently working on a book titled "The Third Person: American Fiction in the Age of Illeism," which argues that modern identity takes place in the third person, a development I trace back to the emergence of the naturalist novel in the late nineteenth century. Other current projects include a book on the work of Thomas Pynchon, and essays on the relationship between faith and narrative in the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, spectatorship in Michael Winterbottom\'s "Wonderland," the role of confession in the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the use of allusion in Herman Melville\'s "Billy Budd."'

S'For decades the hippocampus has been the focus of research on the neural  basis of memory. Studies conducted over the last few years have provided  evidence that cortical areas surrounding the hippocampus contribute to some  forms of memory. Given the long-standing concept that the hippocampus serves  a critical role in memory processes, the finding that some memory tasks are sensitive to lesions of these adjacent cortical regions, alone, has highlighted  the need for close examination of the function of those adjacent structures.  My research program uses neuroanatomical, experimental lesion, and electrophysiological approaches to examine the contribution of these regions, including the perirhinal,  postrhinal/parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices, to memory and to other  higher cognitive functions. Among other approaches, we employ single-unit recording in behaving animals to examine neuronal firing correlates of behavioral events in tasks that tap such functions as spatial memory, recognition memory,  configuration of multiple stimuli, attentional processes, and the processing  of context. These approaches are used to differentiate the function of these cortical regions from each other and from those of the hippocampus.'

S'Recent work includes the determination of the kinetic mechanisms of heterogeneous gas-solid reactions relevant to gasification and oxidation of coal and carbon materials. The oxidizing gases (e.g., O2, CO2, H2O, NO, etc.) form oxygen complexes on carbon surfaces. At low temperatures, these complexes are permanently chemisorbed, while at higher temperatures they desorb as the oxides of carbon, thereby "gasifying" the material. The key to unraveling the kinetics of these reactions lies in understanding the role and energetics of the oxygen surface complex intermediates. This is a complex problem in view of the variable and evolving physical and chemical nature of the solid reactant which manifests itself in such phenomena as a continually evolving pore structure and a distribution of desorption activation energies of the complexes, among other problems. Related problems include the structural transformation/ordering of carbonaceous materials, as well as the development of characterization techniques for these materials. Examples of the latter incxlude small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), contrast matching, and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to monitor porosity development. <br /><br />Another major research direction in Professor Calo\'s laboratory involves addressing technological problems of environmental import. A new research project is directed at the development of  novel spouted-bed particulate electrodes for the removal of metals from aqueous waste streams. Both electrowinning and elecrosorption/desorption of heavy metal species are amenable to this novel approach.<br /><br />Another project involves a liquid-fluidization technique for the micro-sorting of waste plastic particles for recycling. The process involves separation of plastic particles by density via liquid-fluidized bed classification (LFBC) and particle size/density modification technique (e.g., selective swelling or shrinking of particles as a result of thermal waves imposed on the liquid-fluidized bed or selective swelling solvents). Yet another more recent project involves the application of related segregation in liquid-fluidized beds to coal beneficiation.'

S'Prof. Cane\'s major research interests are the elucidation of the enzymology and genetics of biosynthetic pathways.<br />1) Studies of the genetics and enzymology of polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis are carried out in close collaboration with the group of Prof. Chaitan Khosla of Stanford University.  This work includes the study of the antibiotics erythromycin, picromycin, methymycin and tylosin, as well as the polyether antibiotic nanchangmycin (dianemycin, in collaboration with Prof. Zixin Deng of Shanghai Jiaotong University).  Major accomplishments in the last year include the development of a sensitive and robust method to determine the stereochemical specifity of the fundamental polyketide chain building reaction, based on the dissection of several modular synthases into their functional component domains and reconstitution of the activity of the complete modules.<br />2) Studies of terpenoid synthesizing enzymes have focused in recent years on determination of the structure of these proteins and in the use of various genetic and chemical tools to elucidate the mode of action of these enzymes.  One of the great challenges in genomics and proteomics is the identification of the biochemical function of the thousands of uncharacterized gene products that are filling the emerging genome sequence databases.  Using an approach that can be called "genome mining" the Cane lab has been expressing and characterizing the component genes of terpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces species that play an important role in microbial genetics and serve as the sources of majority of known antibiotic natural products.  In the course of this work they continue to discover previously unknown enzymes and to identify their mode of action.  For example they have now defined the role of two-thirds of the 12 genes encoding biosynthesis of the antibiotic pentalenolactone and have discovered a completely unanticipated mechanism for the enzymatic formation of geosmin, the ubiquitous microbial metabolite responsible for the characteristic odor of soil and the source of the "off-taste" of water and various foods. Recently Prof. Cane and his coworkers have also uncovered an entirely new pathway for the biosynthesis of a second "off-taste" constituent, methyl isoborneol. In collaborative research with Prof. David Christianson of the University of Pennsylvania, they have also continued to determine new terpenoid synthase structures of both native and mutant enzymes, either free or with bound substrates or inhibitors.'

S"David E. Cane was born in New York in 1944.  After undergraduate study at Harvard, he received his Ph. D. in 1971 from Harvard University for research in organic synthesis carried out under the direction of Prof. E. J. Corey.  During this period he developed an interest in the origins of natural products that led him to pursue postdoctoral study in natural products biosynthesis and bioorganic chemistry with Prof. Duilio Arigoni at the Eidgen&#246;ssiche Technische Hochschule in Z&#252;rich.  In 1973, he joined the faculty of Brown University where he is now Vernon K. Krieble Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Biochemistry.  His research interests include the chemistry, enzymology and molecular genetics of natural products biosynthesis.  This research has led to the identification, purification, and characterization of a variety of new enzymes that catalyze the conversion of the universal acyclic precursor, farnesyl diphosphate, to cyclic sesquiterpenes.  Studies on these enzymes have established many key details of this fascinating cyclization process. In addition, cloning, over-expression, and site-directed mutagenesis of terpenoid synthase genes has provided large quantities of protein for further mechanistic and structural studies, and resulted in the elucidation of several crystal structures of a terpene synthase, the latter work carried out in collaboration with Prof. David W. Christianson of the University of Pennsylvania.  In work on macrolide antibiotics, carried out in close collaboration with Prof. Chaitan Khosla of Stanford University, a combination of synthetic, enzymological, and molecular genetic approaches is being used to clarify the intricate sequence of events that is required to convert the simple building blocks such as acetate and propionate to complex macrolides such as the broad spectrum antibiotic erythromycin A and picromycin.  In other recent work, Prof. Cane and his collaborators have investigated the enzymology and mechanism of formation of vitamin B6 and have established the role of two key enzymes in the formation of the characteristic pyridoxine ring.  Prof. Cane has been a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (1983) and a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow (1990), and has twice held Senior International Fellowships (1990, 1999) from the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health.  In addition, he has received a number of awards, including the Ernest Guenther Award (1985), the Cope Scholar Award (2000), and the Repligen Award (2005) of the American Chemical Society, the Simonsen Lecture of the Royal Society of Chemistry (1990-91), the Kitasato Medal in Microbial Chemistry (1995), the Prelog Medal of the Eidgen&#246;ssische Technische Hochschule, Z&#252;rich, and a Ph. D. (honoris causa) from the University of Kalmar, Sweden.  He is a Fellow of the American Association of the Advancement of Science.  In addition to over 250 scientific publications, he has recently co-edited a book of his father's World War II Letters published by Fordham University Press."

S'Beginning in the mid 1980s, our laboratory has had a key part in the discoveries leading to major improvements in population-based prenatal screening for serious birth defects, particularly Down syndrome (trisomy 21).<br /><br />In 1987 and 1988, we found that the maternal serum levels of estriol, the major estrogen of pregnancy, tended to be low in pregnancies affected by fetal Down syndrome. In 1988, in collaboration with colleagues at the Medical College of St. Bartholomew\'s Hospital in London and the Foundation for Blood Research in Maine, we showed that combining estriol measurement in the early second trimester with the measurement of two other pregnancy products, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) would lead to a major improvement in the identification of pregnancies at high risk of fetal Down syndrome. Rather than only older pregnant women (35 years and older) being considered at sufficiently high risk to undergo the invasive diagnostic procedures (amniocentesis and cytogenetic analysis) needed to definitively identify affected pregnancies, for the first time the risk of pregnant women of all ages could be assessed with a high degree of accuracy. This so-called "triple test" detects about 70% of Down syndrome pregnancies (70% sensitivity) at a 5% screen positive rate (95% specificity), more than double the performance when using maternal age alone as the indicator of risk.<br /><br />In addition to screening for Down syndrome, we showed in 1990 and that the triple test would be highly effective in identifying pregnancies at risk of Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18; a usually lethal aneuploidy that is about one-third as common as Down syndrome during the second trimester).<br /><br />In 1994, we were the first to publish on an effective fourth marker in screening for Down syndrome, the placental hormone inhibin-A. The addition of inhibin-A to the triple test (resulting in the quad test) has increased the detection rate from 70% to 80%, without changing the specificity.<br /><br />In recent years, new screening methods (the First Trimester and Integrated Tests) have been suggested, and our screening program has been directly involved in their validation and implementation in this country. The program served as the central laboratory and reporting site for the recently-completed multicenter NIH-funded intervention trial known as FASTER (First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk of Aneuploidy). Our research activities continue, with new emphasis on screening for major complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia and preterm delivery, as well as continued work on improving screening for Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities.'

S'Weibiao Cao studies the signal transduction pathways mediating contraction in normal esophageal smooth muscle and the inflammation-associated changes in signaling that occur in experimental esophagitis. His findings show that a low molecular weight phospholipase A2 (type I) mediates cat and human in vitro lower esophageal sphincter tone by producing arachidonic acid, which is metabolized to prostaglandin F2alpha and thromboxane A2.  These arachidonic acid metabolites act on receptors linked to Gi3 and Gq proteins to activate phospholipases, producing second messengers, and maintaining LES tone. He also investigates inflammation-induced changes in contractile signal transduction pathways of human sigmoid colon and study the effect of inflammatory mediators on colonic motor function in ulcerative colitis. His findings demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide and IL-1beta may play an important role in motor dysfunction in ulcerative colitis. Currently he is studying the mechanisms of the progression from Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma, focusing on the role of NADPH oxidases-derived reactive oxygen species. His research on NADPH oxidase NOX5-S shows that NADPH oxidase NOX5-S is overexpressed in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells and mediates acid-induced hydrogen peroxide production. Acid-induced NOX5-S expression depends on an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of a transcription factor CREB. NOX5-S contributes to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells.'

S'My research is focused on the treatment of co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUD) in veterans. Traditional treatment approaches have tended to be sequential (SUD treatment first, then PTSD) but recent awareness of the need for treatments that target both disorders at the same time has led to development of integrated treatments. After completing a small open trial of an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in order to assess feasibility, we are about to launch (January 2012) a randomized pilot trial of ICBT. This study is taking place at the Providence VA Medical Center with veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. This phase of the research will compare ICBT + treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU only. The ICBT protocol combines individual and group psychotherapy and is delivered in about 12 sessions. We hypothesize that veterans who receive ICBT will show better outcomes in terms of PTSD symptoms and substance use as compared with those receiving TAU.'

S'TITLE:   Intrinsic Circadian Period:  Development, Delayed Phase, and Genetic Associations, Part 1:  Measuring the Brain\'s Day Length in Adolescents&#151;Summer Sleep Camp<br /><br />P.I.:      Mary A. Carskadon, Ph.D.<br /><br />FUNDING SOURCE:  National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)<br /><br />DESCRIPTON:  The purpose of this project is to determine the internal day length set by the brain and how the day length may change during adolescent development.  The measurement of the brain\'s internal day length requires an extended period of observation in the time-free laboratory environment under a specific set of circumstances that permit the brain\'s rhythm to run free from the usual imposed 24 hour cycle.  Participants live in the laboratory (Summer Sleep Camp) for up to three weeks in order for this measure to be made.  While gathering this important piece of data, we also have the opportunity to make many other observations about the regulation of sleep and sleepiness and the timing of moods and best performance on a number of tasks.  We also hope to measure day length in individuals before and after puberty, as well as to follow postpubertal adolescents into young adulthood.  Finally, cheek swab samples will be collected in order to examine genes that may be associated with the internal day length.<br /><br />SIGNIFICANCE:  The data from this project will provide crucial information about the mechanisms underlying the regulation of adolescent sleep/wake patterns and how they may change during adolescent development.  Furthermore, the behavioral test data may provide a foundation for understanding the timing of classroom behaviors in adolescents.<br /><br />TITLE:    Intrinsic Circadian Period:  Development, Delayed Phase, and Genetic Associations, Part 2:  Sleep Homeostasis and Adolescent Development - Summer Sleep Camp<br /><br />P.I.:      Mary A. Carskadon, Ph.D.<br /><br />FUNDING SOURCE:  NIMH<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:  This project examines the sleeping EEG patterns of adolescents using spectral analysis to assess brain wave patterns across the night.  Baseline night data from in-lab evaluations provide an indication of the sleep pressure or sleep "need" in younger versus older adolescents who have been maintaining similar sleep schedules for nearly two weeks.  Sleep EEG analyses made after children have been awake for 36 hours tell us how the brain builds up the pressure for sleep and whether this buildup changes across adolescent development.  We also plan to examine the buildup of sleep pressure during EEG tests that take place across 36 hours of wakefulness.  In addition, this research project aims to follow the same participants before and after they achieve puberty.<br /><br />SIGNIFICANCE:  This project will provide information about the fundamental organization of sleep in the adolescent brain and the ways in which the brain\'s sleep mechanisms change during adolescent development.  Such data can help us understand the contribution of the biological regulatory systems to the shifts in sleep patterns that commonly occur during adolescent development.<br /><br />OVERALL SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE PROJECTS:   Basic knowledge gained and discovery of genetic associations with these biological processes can help target ways to improve teen sleep and waking behavior and may even help with treatment for adolescent sleep disorders.  This information will equip us better to intervene effectively to improve sleep patterns for adolescents in whom sleep and daytime sleepiness are a problem.  Such information may also help us influence societal trends, such as early school start and late night activities that seem to run counter to the biological sleep needs and propensities of adolescents.<br /><br />TITLE:   Prospective Study of Depressed Mood, Short Sleep and Serotonergic Genes (Does Short Sleep Lead to Depressed Mood by Altering Serotonin Receptor Function?)<br /><br />P.I.:     Mary A. Carskadon, Ph.D.<br /><br />FUNDING SOURCE:  NIMH<br /><br />DESCRIPTON:  The transition to college is a major life change that often involves insufficient sleep, as well as changes to the timing of sleeping and waking behavior.  Further, college students often experience depressed mood.  This project uses the transition to college as a model system to examine whether the serotonin neurotransmitter system (specifically the 5-HT1a receptor) is involved in depressed mood of college students.  Students are evaluated in the spring before entering college; selection to the college part of the study is based on the springtime information about sleep patterns and pre-existing mood disorders.  On entry into college, the students complete a daily sleep-wake diary and give a cheek swab sample for gene analysis to examine genetic vulnerability.<br /><br />SIGNIFICANCE: This project will determine whether short sleep can lead to depressed mood in college students.  Depression is a serious concern among college students&#151;an impediment to academic performance and a risk for suicide.  These studies will examine whether students are susceptible to depression if they carry a certain genetic background and then get too little sleep and whether the association is related to the serotonin system.  Such knowledge can help target prevention of the development of depression.'

S"For several decades my principal research work has been on the epidemiology of neonatal jaundice, the capacity of albumin to transport bilirubin in the blood; and the toxicity of bilirubin to the neonatal brain, examined in both clinical and laboratory studies.  I showed a relationship between gestational age and plasma albumin concentrations between 28 weeks and term; variability in the carrying capacity of albumin for bilirubin depending on infants' gestational age and clinical condition; and a possible association between free bilirubin concentration and bilirubin neurotoxicity in newborns.  Basic studies included physiologic measurements of brain uptake and rates of bilirubin transfer to the brain in animal models, and the toxicity of bilirubin to the dopamine system in synaptosome.  From the 1970s to the 1990s, I had funding for this work from various sources including the Hood Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, but do not currently have outside research funding for this work.<br /><br />A secondary interest in nutrition has been reflected in several peer-reviewed publications from the period 1975 to 1980 on the effects of intravenous fat in low birth weight infants.  I am currently a co-investigator in a multi-center trial of carotene supplementation in supplemental premature infant formulas to improve antioxidant capacity in very low birth weight infants.

S"Speech and language development during early childhood in preterm infants is often delayed and the language environment in the NICU may play a role in this delay.  Studies done previously have shown that the percentage of time that preterm infants are exposed to language is on average between 3 and 5% in the open bay NICU and the number of words that a preterm child hears in the NICU is associated with higher Bayley scores at 7 and 18 months corrected age.1  It has also been shown in older children that the number of words that a term child hears in early childhood has a direct impact on future IQ and speech and language development2.  It is well documented that the NICU has a significant amount of background noise especially in open bay NICUs3,4, but little is known about the language environment in the single-patient room NICU and how that environment affects language development in preterm infants.<br /><br />Dr. Caskey's research objectives are: 1) to analyze the language environment in a single patient room NICU and compare that to previously done work in an open bay NICU and 2) to design, implement and evaluate a language intervention for the parents of preterm infants in the NICU designed to promote language skills for their babies."

S'Caroline Castiglione is a historian in the departments of Italian Studies and History. Her research interests are political, cultural, and women\'s history in Italy during the period 1500-1800. Her book, <i>Patrons and Adversaries: Nobles and Villagers in Italian Politics, 1640-1760</i> (Oxford University Press, 2005) furthered our understanding of how vitally important governing was to every class of society in early modern Italy, including nobles and villagers. She focused on central Italy, specifically on the Roman countryside, typically viewed as a site of contestation between great aristocratic families and an expanding papal political regime. <i>Patrons and Adversaries</i> demonstrated that one prestigious aristocratic family, the Barberini, was not squeezed out of governing by the extension of the papal bureaucracy, but rather became increasingly engaged with it between the late seventeenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Through their activities in the rural commune, villagers in an extensive territory belonging to the family also became active participants in governing the countryside. Villagers cultivated and exploited interference from the aristocratic family and the papal government, but they also kept urban elites at bay, defending their rights through the strategies she called "adversarial literacy." Villagers cobbled these literate practices together from their mastery of their constitutions, from debating in the village assembly, from dragging their feet in the payment of dues and dragging their lords into papal courts. In its later manifestations, adversarial literacy involved villagers writing and interpreting sources for themselves in order to challenge the monopoly on text-making claimed by ruling elites in Rome. A lost world of increasingly savvy villagers, irate nobles, and exasperated bureaucrats is analyzed to illustrate how villagers challenged who controlled the rural world, using texts and ideas that urban elites had exported to the countryside for other purposes.<br /><br />Prof. Castiglione has published articles related to her current research project, <i>Accounting for Affection</i>, which examines the symbiotic evolution of politics and mothering in early modern Rome, where mothers did not hesitate to turn to the expanding judicial system if the future of their children were at stake. By examining comparatively a range of maternal sources -- women\'s legal activities, their letters, and their daily routines of caring for children -- Castiglione uses a microhistorical approach to analyze the intersection of maternal affection, female advocacy, and family conflict in the papal city.   <br /><br />In both projects she has been concerned with how seemingly marginalized individuals were able to challenge the systems of power relations that in theory left them without a voice. Both projects required archival sleuthing in obscure places &#150; rarely utilized village archives or sources not always well catalogued because they pertained to women. Such archival excursions further our understanding of the ways that subaltern groups used non-violent judicial and literate means to broaden received beliefs about their rights in society and in the family. In both teaching and writing, she emphasizes the gradual and collective elements of this process and the irrecoverable anonymity of many who contributed to it.'

S"Professor Caswell's main area of research is the numerical simulation of flow processes. Current work is directed toward the fluid mechanics of non-Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids, and their analysis by finite element methods. Mechanically these fluids are described by nonlinear constitutive equations of the differential and integral type. The parameters (modulus, viscosity, relaxation times) which appear in these equations must be fitted from rheological data, which, in practice, is incomplete. A current project is directed at developing algorithms for optimal fitting with incomplete data.  Modern manufacturing techniques are motivated by the need to rapidly produce prototypes of new products. One method of Rapid Prototyping is controlled deposition of micro droplets, which solidify to produce a three-dimensional object layer-upon-layer. Current technology limits the droplet materials to thermoplastic waxes and certain plastics; the goal is to extend the technology to functional materials, especially metals.  The simulation problem to be solved is the detailed description of droplet impact on a surface followed by solidification. This work is being carried out in conjunction with experimental work at Cornell University.  Molten glass processing is modeled by treating the glass as a Newtonian fluid with a strongly temperature-sensitive viscosity. Hence heat transfer, including relative transfer, is the controlling factor in the simulation of the processing of glass in the molten state. For glasses with stratified refractive index the description of radiative transfer is being developed for application to the simulation of drawing of optical fibers."

S"John Cayley has been making works of literary art using programmable media since the late 1970s. Links to some of this work can be found on his personal website at http://programmatology.shadoof.net, and recently a number of his pieces were included in the important Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 1, http://collection.eliterature.org, edited by Hayles, Montfort, Rettberg, and Strickland. In addition to his own creative literary practice, Cayley has been significantly engaged with literary theory and criticism as applied to writing for and in digital media, and he continues to publish articles and other contributions regularly in the field.<br /><br />Recently, he has been concerned with the properties and methods of textuality in digitally mediated writing and, indeed, writing generally. Specifically, he has been concerned with the relationship between textual practice and code, coding, or 'codework.' He sees the increasing engagements and influences of coding and writing, but seeks to explore coding - and its associated emergent rhetoric - as a distinct but related formation of practices.<br /><br />Additionally, because of past associations and due in major part to his recent appointment at Brown, Cayley has also be interested to explore the phenomenology of writing in space, the literal or, rather, virtual space provided by Brown's Cave, its immersive 3D environment, for which he teaches an advanced Cave Writing workshop, where students  design and create literary objects for this complex 3D visualization device. Work in the Cave has sparked off strong potential for new cross-disciplinary research that Cayley intends to develop, specifically:<br /><br /><b>'Literal' / Literary Graphics, Visualization, and Cognition in Immersive VR</b><br />Can literal matter help build space? How good are letters and words at delineating and defining spatial structures graphically? What aspects of the <i>linguistic</i> functioning of literal graphic material contributes to its space-defining or 3D-world-defining facility? Does the 'legibility', for example, of letters enhance their ability to give distance cues in immersive 3D environments? Are there aesthetic and even literary aesthetic effects that could be identified from research into these questions and then used to extend the rhetoric of literary creative practice in new media?<br /><br />These questions arose from previous work by Cayley and others in Brown's Cave as part of Robert Coover's Cave Writing initiative. Work on pieces in the Cave has led Cayley to hypothesize that letters and words and larger fragments of language, rendered in 3D VR, give enhanced distance cues, not only because of their sharp, complex outlines. The letters are also distinctly spatialized because their complex outline are 'familiar' and they are familiar because they 'legible' as part of our system of inscription. Letters are, by functional definition, the size they are and the distance they are so as to be read. These seem to be phenomena worth exploring in more detail, with a good measure of potential for the near future of visual representation in graphic systems.<br /><br />Cayley has written about this and other experiences in the Cave for the <i>Leonardo Electronic Almanac</i>:<br />http://leoalmanac.org/journal/vol_14/lea_v14_n05-06/jcayley.asp<br />... and there is an associated, very simple 'web-toy' that he made to test certain effects:<br />http://www.shadoof.net/in/?nf/<br />... plus a piece, a maquette, also related, that attempts to exploit aspects of all this, aesthetically:<br />http://www.shadoof.net/in/?lens.html"

As the dimensions of advanced device structures continue to decrease, it becomes increasingly important to understand how thin films develop in order to precisely control their structure and properties. A major aspect of this research has been the development of in situ diagnostics that enable the changes in morphology and microstructure to be monitored as they occur.  <br /><br />Recent work has focused on 1) the development of residual stress during thin film growth; 2) the processes controlling the formation of whiskers in Sn coatings; 3) evolution of self-organized surface patterns during low energy ion sputtering; and 4) stress relaxation in heteroepitaxial layers via dislocations and islanding.  This work includes experimental measurements, computer simulation of film growth and sputtering, and development of models to relate the experimental results to fundamental materials processes.<br /><br />Research techniques developed include a multi-beam optical sensor (MOSS) for measuring wafer curvature (proportional to film stress) during growth in ultra-high vacuum and other environments.  In addition, a novel in situ spectroscopic light scattering technique allows the measurements of surface morphology without interrupting processing. In situ x-ray reflectivity has also been developed in order to study surface roughness and buried interfaces during growth, annealing, and low energy ion sputtering."

S'Targeting a specific gene or gene product is becoming a prominent feature of molecular cancer therapy where the ultimate therapeutic goal is to trigger tumor-selective apoptosis or growth arrest. We discovered that Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) expression was robustly induced when human cancer cells were exposed to clinically relevant anticancer agents and induced to undergo apoptosis. The direct correlation between RKIP expression and the extent of apoptosis suggests that up-regulation of RKIP is one of the mechanisms that sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic signals in response to chemotherapeutic agent-induced DNA damage. RKIP disrupts the Raf-1&#150;MEK1/2&#150;ERK1/2 and NF-&#61547;B signaling pathways thereby abrogating the survival and anti-apoptotic properties of these signaling pathways. Thus, regulation of cell survival pathways by RKIP suggests that this protein may play a pivotal role in tumor progression. In addition to the Raf and NF-&#61547;B pathways, our recent findings indicate that RKIP interferes with the Src/Jak (Janus kinases) and STAT (signal transducer and activators of transcription) cell survival signaling pathway. Thus, RKIP behaves as a multiple kinase inhibitor. Studies, including our own, have demonstrated that RKIP expression is predictive of clinical outcome and is a metastasis suppressor in many human tumors. Significantly, in gastric cancer there is an inverse association between RKIP and STAT3 expression with patient clinical outcome.  <br />The projects in my lab are tailored to understanding the mechanisms by which RKIP is an inhibitor of metastasis and cell survival signaling and how RKIP function can be regulated.  Below is a brief overview of the projects.<br /><br />A) In stage II colon cancer, STAT3 has been shown to promote metastasis. We are investigating if the induction of RKIP expression can inhibit STAT3-triggered metastasis in human colon cancer cells. Future studies will explore the mechanism by which this occurs.<br /><br />B) Breast cancer patients can become resistant to combination chemotherapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin.  Growth factors such as estrogen or EGF can promote resistant breast cell growth by activating cell survival pathways. We are identifying the pathways that are activated in biopsied tumor samples and cell culture models.  Our goal is to inhibit these pathways to restore sensitivity, possibly by the induction of RKIP expression. <br /><br />C) Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major risk factor in the development of gastric cancer, in part, by the activation of the Jak/STAT and Nf-kB pathways and the induction of apoptosis.  We hypothesized that RKIP could inhibit H. pylori-mediated gastric cancer progression by blocking these pathways.  Instead our studies have indicated that H. pylori infection results in:  1) the phosphorylation of RKIP, 2) an increase in RKIP transcription mediated by phosphorylated RKIP; 3) increase in STAT3 activation; and 4) increase in H. pylori-mediated apoptosis. The mechanisms by which these unexpected events occur are an active focus of research in the lab.'

S'The research focus in our laboratory is skeletal development, fracture healing, and cartilage & bone repair.  In one area, we are studying how mechanical stress regulates bone growth and regeneration.  People have known that mechanical stress plays an important part in maintaining bone health.  For example, regular exercise that exerts appropriate loading to the joint enhances bone mass, while too little loading (such as what astronauts experience in outer space under zero gravity) or too much loading (such as what occurs during sports injuries) damages or diminishes bone formation.  If we understand the underlying mechanism, we can apply our knowledge to improving joint health in daily life and accelerate bone repair and rehabilitation after fracture.  This exciting research project is supported by National Institute of Health.  We discovered important biochemical molecules in the joint that mediate mechanical stimulation of bone formation.   <br /><br />In the second area, the laboratory is focusing on how to improve early diagnosis and joint repair during arthritis.  Arthritis is one of the leading causes of disability in America.  Very often when patients feel joint pain and are diagnosed by X-ray, the joint cartilage is beyond repair and has to be replaced by artificial joint.  We are developing new "bio-markers" to diagnose arthritis at early stages.  In addition, we are determining the function of newly discovered structural matrix proteins that form the framework of joint cartilage, with the hope that these "glue-like" proteins can be used to repair damaged cartilage in the clinics in future.  These research projects are supported by Arthritis Foundation and National Institute of Health.  <br /><br />For his accomplishment in research leading to prevention and early treatment of arthritis and other joint diseases, Dr. Chen has been awarded Kappa Delta Award from American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Satterfield Arthritis Investigator Award from Arthritis Foundation, and Independent Scientist Award from National Institute of Health.'

S'Tyrosine phosphorylation has long been considered to play a prominent role in signal transduction.  STAT family members are signaling and transcription proteins activated by different transmembrane receptors of cytokines and growth factors.  Our laboratory studies whether acetylation and methylation also play a critical role in signal transduction process.  We are exploring different STAT family members for their differential acetylation and methylation patterns in gene regulation under both physiological and pathological conditions. The principle of yin-yang, the balance between opposing natural forces emphasized in Oriental medicine, can be epitomized as the property of signal transduction and gene regulation in cells.  Acetylation and deacetylation, methylation and demethylation, such a balance creates a dynamic state that is responsive for cell differentiation, development, and homeostasis.  Derangements of dynamically controlled balances between these opposite forces can seriously upset homeostasis in a cell. We are exploring how acetylation/methylation cascade triggered by cellular environmental changes for a cell develops from normal to inflammatory and to cancer type. We are interested in exploring how inflammatory signals mediated by cytokine recetors and STAT proteins transform cells; whether STAT form differential enhanceosomes during inflammation and transformation; and whether restoring the balance between acetylation/methylation and deacetylation/deacetylation of STAT can restrict invasive growth and metastasis of cancer cells.<br /><br />Antibody array technology was first developed in our laboratory for protein profile in mammalian cells. By printing hundreds or thousands different antibodies on a solid support, we can screen protein-protein interaction and protein posttranslational modifications in mammalian cells. Based upon this method, enhanceosome precipitation assay (EPA) has been developed for promoter binding transcription factor complex identification in inflammatory or cancer cells.

More recently, I have been exploring how the effect of maternal incarceration may vary by children's developmental stages as well as by the frequency and duration of incarceration.

In another paper, I empirically examine the effect of three mechanisms commonly suggested to influence children's outcomes (specifically, adolescent school dropout rates) related maternal incarceration -- mother-child separation; removal from maternal guardianship; and stigma. <br /><br />In addition to my work related to maternal incarceration, I have been evaluating the impact of prison-based education on male inmate's post-release labor market outcomes with John Tyler. We attempt to identify the causal impact of both participating and completing educational programs in prison on earnings and employment rates during the 3 years following prison release. This paper is forthcoming in Crime and Delinquency. <br /><br />Lastly, I have become increasingly interested in immigrant families and particularly with their children. One topic of interest is the effect of the 1996 welfare reform on Mexican immigrant families' birth outcomes. The other topic I am currently exploring is the peer effects associated with having English Language Learner (ELL) classmates on academic achievement for children who primarily speak English."

S'Maintaining the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment is essential for proper neuronal function. This homeostasis is maintained, in large part, thanks to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). The endothelium of brain capillaries forms the BBB, whereas the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus constitute the BCSFB. The function and integrity of these barriers are affected in various CNS disorders (such as ischemia, trauma, neurodegenerative diseases) and cancer, which has an important impact on the progression of these CNS disorders and on the efficacy of potential therapies.<br /><br />I am interested in the function of the BBB and BCSFB in the context of brain injury and aging. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death of young Americans, accounting for around 100,000 fatalities each year. TBI is usually accompanied by cerebral edema, a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive brain swelling. Despite the importance of this medical condition, very limited progress has been made in the past decades in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying edema formation, which has resulted in a paucity of effective therapies available for clinical use. Brain barriers control the movement of blood-borne molecules and inflammatory cells into the CNS, and the dysfunction of these barriers plays an important role in the formation of post-traumatic brain edema. In my laboratory, we investigate how neuropeptides, growth factors, and cytokines affect the function of brain barriers in the injured CNS. This research is aimed at finding new therapeutic approaches for cerebral edema.<br /><br />Another aspect of our research is to understand how and why the function of the BBB and BCSFB changes in advanced age. Although TBI is most prevalent in the youth population, the incidence of brain injury is also high in the elderly. The outcome in the elderly population is usually worse, compared to young patients, with prolonged recovery and permanent neurological deficits. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. Our studies focus on defining the age-related factors that cause the dysfunction of brain barriers and on identifying potential targets for effective TBI treatment in the elderly.'

How should one's beliefs be affected by one's knowing that other people--equally informed, rational and intelligent people--believe differently? He is currently working on questions about how our theory of ideal rationality should accommodate rational self-doubt, and, in general, what constraints rationality puts on the way one regards one's own beliefs.

S'A recent study by Mirena Christoff compares three Arabic adaptations of the French romantic novel "Paul et Virginie" (1788) by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre.  The Arabic texts that were examined represent variants of the novel composed in Egypt within a period of fifty years in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century.  Drawing upon current translation studies by Bassnett, Lefevere, and Toury, among others, Christoff shows that literary translations, like original writings, reflect the specific circumstances, worldviews, and writing techniques of their authors.  In particular, the comparative study of the three Arabic novels inspired by "Paul et Virginie" sheds additional light on the outlook and modernizing literary style of Muhammad `Uthman Jalal, Farah Antun, and Mustafa al-Manfaluti, three outstanding intellectual and artistic figures in Egyptian culture at the time of transition to modernity.  It reveals specific responses to modernity by Arab authors who used translation to express their artistic individuality; to voice concerns current in their society and time; to explore non-traditional writing techniques and coin new linguistic forms, drawing inspiration from and-- simultaneously--encouraging and shaping readers\' modern literary sensibilities.<br />Other research topics include modern Arabic translation and cultural history; the study of aspects of the linguistic transmission between non-cognate languages; the integration of translation in foreign language instruction, etc.'

S'Inflammatory cells secret a wide variety of immunoregulatory mediators, such as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, prostanoids etc., at different stages during the course of the development of trauma/sepsis.  Both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are critical for the host to eliminate invasive agents after injury.  However, many of these cytokines have also been implicated in having detrimental effects on organ function and eventual mortality seen in patients with severe traumatic injuries and/or sepsis.  Following trauma and shock there appears to be loss of the normal regulatory function controlling the pro-inflammatory response.  Over the years, the traditional studies on cytokines have focused on the mechanisms of how they set forth their actions.  Recent investigations concerning regulation of the negative feedback of cytokine signaling have advanced considerably.  Dysregulation of the negative feedback loops of JAK/STAT pathway has been implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, hematopoietic disorders, and cancers.  Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway is negatively (downregulated) controlled.  Several negative regulators of JAK/STAT pathway have been identified such as SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1), SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), PTEN, CD45, and a new family of proteins, the suppressor of cytokines signaling (SOCS) family proteins.  Using a mouse model of traumatic injury/shock, current studies are focused on the role of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in the immune response after injury.  By understanding the molecular mechanism of negative regulatory pathways of the immune system should improve our knowledge of cytokine signaling associated with diseases and their contribution to pathology that could lead to the design of potentially novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of trauma/shock.'

Four approaches to the study of duration discrimination have been employed: behavioral, mathematical, cognitive, and biological.

S"The overall goal of Dr. Ciombor's research is to optimize the conditions, both physiologic and biophysical, of a<br />tissue-engineered biocomposite to restore the form and function of articular cartilage in damaged<br />joints. Tissue engineering has held great promise for the repair or regeneration of damaged tissues,<br />however available chondrocyte-based constructs have to date had significant limitations, including<br />limited healing, high cost, breakdown of the tissue implant leading to loss of function, and limited<br />availability of competent cellular components.<br /><br />The overall hypothesis is that cell-based engineered cartilage biocomposites can be<br />created using a sub-population of synoviocytes (SF-B), which can be induced by growth factors to<br />differentiate into chondrocytes. However, both biochemical and biophysical factors that are necessary<br />to produce a tissue engineered construct with more physiologic biochemical, ultra-structural and<br />mechanical properties remain unknown."

S"As a survey methodologist, my research interests are in survey design and data collection methodologies. My substantive interests are in women's health, and particularly the role that psychosocial factors play in health behaviors among middle-aged and older women. My previous work has been primarily in the areas of cancer control and detection (i.e., cancer screenings and smoking cessation). A consistent theme in all of my work is to better understand the context of the lives of underserved populations to better inform public health interventions.<br /><br />My interests integrate public health survey design and questionnaire development with substantive areas of women's health and tobacco. With extensive experience in questionnaire development and data collection methodologies, I direct the primary data collection activities within the Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research. For instance, I am currently the Principal Investigator of the Measures and Methods Core for the 5-year renewal of the Brown University Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use in Research Center (TTURC; PI: Dr. Raymond Niaura). As PI of the Measures and Methods Core, I direct the development of the core and project-specific protocols and am responsible for leading all data collection activities. I recently completed a 5-year NCI-funded grant about multiple cancer screenings (breast, cervical, colorectal) among unmarried women. This project evaluated three survey protocols (mailed questionnaire, telephone interview, and computerized self-administered questionnaire) for collecting data from women ages 40 to 75 years.<br /><br />A theme of much of my work is the integration of multiple health behaviors. For instance, I have collaborated for several years with William Rakowski, PhD on the relationships between women's cancer screenings as well as the relationship between cancer screenings and tobacco use.<br /><br />A consistent theme in all of my work is to better understand the context of the lives of underserved populations to better inform public health interventions. The NCI grant about unmarried women is an example of this. In addition, I am currently the PI of a study funded by the Komen Foundation to understand the experiences of unmarried disabled women with mammography screening. I am also collaborating on a grant with colleagues from the University of San Francisco (PI: Rena Pasick, DrPH) to develop and test culturally appropriate measures for five behavioral constructs that form the conceptual basis for many breast cancer screening interventions. Finally, I have worked with several junior colleagues on analyses of racial and ethnic disparities in screening behaviors and outcomes associated with breast, lung, and skin cancer. Some of my most recent grant submissions include projects with underserved populations in experiences with cancer and long-term care."

S'Beginning with Harry Kolsky (deceased) and continuing with Jacques Duffy (deceased) and Rod Clifton, Brown investigators have led the development of the experimental methodologies for studying the mechanical behavior of materials at high strain rates.  The torsional Kolsky bar and the pressure-shear plate impact experiment developed at Brown are widely used to study the deformation and failure of materials at the high strain rates that occur in high speed machining, terminal ballistics, and explosive loading.  Professor Clifton\'s group conducts research on the mechanical response of materials subjected to very high loading rates. This research is motivated by the need for better understanding of such processes as high speed machining, armor penetration, shear band formation, martensitic phase transformations, elastohydrodynamic lubrication, and dynamic fracture. The research involves combined experimental and computational investigations in which the experimental component makes use of plane wave loading to provide the most direct interpretation of the experimental results in terms of the response of the material.  <br />Pressure shear plate impact:  Plane waves are generated in a plate impact facility, which is designed to produce the impact of parallel plates. In order to subject the impacting plates to combined pressure and shear loading, the impacting plates are inclined relative to the direction of approach. The motion of the rear surface of the impacted plate is recorded using a variety of laser interferometers. Computer simulation of the experiment is used to relate the recorded velocity-time profiles to the response of the material being studied.  Scope:  Studies have been conducted on a wide variety of materials including metals, metal alloys, glasses, ceramics, ceramic powders, lubricants, and shape memory alloys. In addition, studies have been conducted on the dynamic friction of sliding interfaces, such as the interface between a machine tool and the stock being machined. Recently, an induction heater has been added that makes it possible to conduct the experiments at temperatures up to 700 degrees C. Experiments can also be conducted in a so-called "soft recovery" configuration in which the specimen is recovered after being subjected to a single plane pulse -- thereby making it possible to relate the dislocation motion or microcracking that occurred to the action of a known stress pulse.  <br /><br />Current projects:  Current research projects are concerned with the modeling of martensitic phase transformation, dynamics failure of steel welds, dynamics plasticity of refractory metals, dislocation mobility in Ni<sub>3</sub>Al, and the competition between shear banding and shear fracture in the dynamic failure of materials.'

S'My main area of  interest is issue conflict. How do some issues gain the attention of officials, while others do not? The key is issue definition: How do successful groups define issues in such a way that other individuals are brought into the conflict? Politics consists of an unending battle between expanders and containers, with the latter usually victorious.<br /><br />Recently I have moved into the area of transportation policy to study these ideas. I am particularly interested in three modes: planes, cars and 18-wheelers.  <br /><br />With planes, the key battle is over the definition of  safety; everything has to be defined in those terms &#150; yet the definitions vary among competing groups. <br /><br />The second area of emphasis is automobiles and drivers. I am particularly interested in elderly drivers and how their issues have been avoided by decision-makers.<br /><br />Another area of concern is the politics of congestion. Traffic congestion is getting worse, and decision-makers have come up with no real solutions to the problem. I want to focus on a small sample of  cities to determine how they have handled the problem, and contrast the cities with partial success and those with none.<br /><br />Big rigs are a major part of the highway experience for all drivers. Polls report that many car drivers feel threatened or scared when the trucks approach. Is this fear justififed? What about accidents with big rigs? Are these vehicles safe? What are officials doing to oversee the problem? How does the media handle problems when rigs cause tie-ups lasting many hours? Are these tie-ups more frequent now than in the past? How do truck interests define the problem to keep legislatures away from additional regulations?'

For elderly drivers, it is mobility. For rush hour drivers, the key is congestion alternatives. For big rig trucks, the key is regulation.'

S"My research uses primarily behavioral methods to examine how information is represented by the animal mind. Current areas of research are:<br /><br /><br />Instrumental learning. One of the most pervasive principles of modern experimental psychology is that behavior is governed by its consequences. One goal of my research has been to determine the extent of an organism's knowledge of the consequences of its acts and the circumstances giving rise to that knowledge. In previous work, I have documented that when multiple outcomes are uniquely correlated with different responses, rats learn which response produces which outcome. Current research is addressing the role of discriminative stimuli in determining instrumental performance.<br /><br />Pavlovian conditioning. The ability to detect relations between events endows an organism with the knowledge to predict the occurrence of future events. Previous work with pigeons examined the effect of degrading the contingency between a signal and its outcome by additional presentations of either that same outcome or related outcomes during acquisition and extinction. Recent work with mice has focused on their ability to represent higher-order relational information where one event modulates the connection between two other events.<br /><br />Effects of early experience on cognitive development. My lab in collaboration with the Creton & Kreiling labs is using zebrafish to examine the effects of embryonic exposure to PCBs on neurobehavioral development. My lab has also developed several procedures for studying the effects of in utero exposure to marijuana on executive functions in cognition in the C57BL/6J mouse.<br /><br />Canid communication. Evidence suggests that animal vocalizations can be used to transmit information about the identity of the sender, information about the motivational or behavioral intent of the sender, and referential information. We have been studying the acoustic structure of canine vocalizations for evidence that pack members produce distinctive sounds that can be used for individual recognition. Other topics include using playback procedures to investigate individual recognition by conspecifics and the deployment of a dynamic intruder classification system. <br /><br />Dog bite prevention. Dog bites are a prevalent source of injury in the US population. It has been estimated that as many as 4.7 million individuals receive dog bites each year and that almost 800,000 of these individuals require medical attention for their bites Children under the age of 10 years are at greater risk for dog bite injuries compared to the adult population. Children are most likely to be bitten by a familiar dog that is their own dog, a dog owned by a relative, or a friend's family dog. In collaboration with the Injury Prevention Center at RI Hospital, we are testing the effectiveness of a dog bite prevention program (Dog Safety & Literacy Program) developed in my lab for children in grades 1 through 4. I have also developed dog bite prevention programs for adults including letter carriers, social workers, health care professionals, animal control officers and animal shelter volunteers. Information about these programs is available on request.<br /><br />Environmental enrichment. Enrichment programs are essential for the physical and psychological well being of zoo animals. In collaboration with staff at the Roger Williams Park Zoo, we are developing new enrichment programs and implementing methods to assess the effectiveness of those programs."

S'In his research, Jonathan Conant explores the inter-regional integration of the late ancient and early medieval Mediterranean.  Most recently, his research has examined the cultural, social, and political connections between North Africa and the rest of the early medieval world.  His book, <i>Staying Roman: Conquest and Identity in North Africa and the Mediterranean, 439-700</i> (Cambridge University Press, in production), represents the first historical examination of the fate of Roman identity in the region of modern Tunisia and Algeria after the collapse there of Roman power, from the Germanic Vandals\' capture of the territory in the early fifth century, through the sixth-century Byzantine reconquest, down to the Islamic invasions of the Maghrib in the late seventh and early eighth centuries.  Though most studies of the early Middle Ages focus on the creation of new, non-Roman identities out of the encounter between "barbarians" and provincial Romans, Conant argues that the idea of being Roman never really ceased to be fundamental among key elements of early medieval society, both in Africa and beyond, even after direct imperial control of the West had long since collapsed.  However, he contends that what it meant to be Roman in the early Middle Ages was constantly changing; and in Africa specifically, the Vandal conquest precipitated the emergence of three competing definitions of Romanness &#150; political, cultural, and religious &#150; all of which remained operational into the early Islamic era and beyond.<br /><br />Conant\'s second book project focuses on Carolingian external relations and how these illuminate the Frankish rulers\' understanding and exercise of empire.  Conant has also authored shorter pieces on the diffusion of North African saints\' cults in the early medieval Mediterranean; on lay literacy and documentary practice in late Roman and early medieval North Africa; and on the Vandal-era North African Jewish community.'

To help understand the mechanisms of the neocortex,  my students and I study the basic physiology of its neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters, and the patterns of its connections. We discovered that inhibitory neurons in the cortex communicate via electrical synapses, and that electrically coupled networks of neurons can serve as pacemakers  for cortical rhythms in the brain. We are also studying how neural activity leads to plasticity of cortical circuits, and how the seizure discharges of epilepsy begin and propagate through the cortex. Our methods include intracellular and extracellular recording and patch clamping, neuroanatomical techniques, isolated slice preparations, and computer modeling.'

S'I have investigated the "rise of modern science" in early modern Europe, especially through the eyes of the medical community, which was heavily involved in it, first by looking at London and England, then at a Dutch doctor who emigrated to London and was tried for malpractice there in the 1690s (becoming a cause celebre), and then by looking into medicine and natural history in The Netherlands and wherever the Dutch went around the world. I have helped to pioneer the use of the medical marketplace as a historical tool of investigation, and more recently have been especially interested in the connections between the rise of global commerce and the development of a global science.

S"My research is concerned with the politics of welfare and political representation in Russia, the Post-Soviet States, and Eastern Europe. My major project at present, a book manuscript titled <i>Postcommunist Welfare States:  Negotiating Change</i>, focuses on the transformation of welfare in the Russian Federation and four additional states from 1991 to the present. It provides an in-depth analysis of changes in the structure and financing of the welfare state, how these were initiated by state actors and negotiated politically, and how they were influenced by both domestic politics and international institutions and policy constructs. The study focuses mainly on Russia, then utilizes several additional cases to place the Russian case into comparative context.  It draws on comparative welfare state literature to construct a framework for analysis of the postcommunist cases, and is based on extensive study of primary sources and interviews in the region. Several publications on postcommunist welfare state reform and change in specific policy areas have also come out of this research.<br /><br />I am also involved in three smaller research projects.  The first is a study of social sector non-governmental organizations in three Russian regions, particularly their roles in building civil society and influencing policy.  It is a collaborative project, funded by the National Council of East European and Eurasian Research, and conducted with Russian colleagues through interviews in the three regions.  <br /><br />A second project concerns the effects of globalization on labor rights and regimes in postcommunist states.  This research looks comparatively at the impacts of international or external organizations (i.e., the European Union, ILO, IFIs, MNC's) on the development of labor rights in several post-Soviet and East European states, and at movement toward flexibilization of work rules and regimes.  It forms part of a collaborative project sponsored by the Watson Institute's Political Economy program.  <br /><br />A third project looks at representation of women and women's interests in the Russian Duma (legislature) over the postcommunist period.  It focuses on the organization of women deputies, their links with societal interests and organizations, and their perceptions of their roles and responsibilities as representative, and is based on extensive interviews with current and former Duma deputies.  <br /><br />My previous research has focused on issues of welfare, political representation, and labor in the Soviet Union and postcommunist states.  It includes an in-depth study of the Communist-era welfare state, its structure and political logic, and the initial impacts of democratization.  My research has also focused on labor, unions, and labor politics, including a monograph on labor in the Russian transition.  Postcommunist political parties and representative institutions have also been a focus of my work, resulting in a collaborative study of left parties and social policy in postcommunist Europe.  Numerous articles and book chapters have also come out of these various strands of my research interests."

One goal of my work is to describe the principles of organization that account for experimental data on the cellular level and can be applied to large numbers of neurons that receive sensory information. <br /><br />In order to learn there clearly must be physiological changes. But it is not yet known what happens quantitatively at the cellular level when learning takes place and when memory is stored. Working with experimental and theoretical colleagues, I have developed mathematical theories that connect system properties with what happens at the molecular level. These theories have been confirmed in many experimental tests. <br /><br />I am also studying the construction of artificial neural networks, networks that can learn, associate and reproduce such higher level cognitive acts as abstraction, computation, and language acquisition. Although these tasks are carried out easily by humans, they have not been easy to embody as conventional computer programs.'

S"The overall theme of the research pursued in my group is the dynamic responses, that is, the mechanical and chemical kinetics, of both crystalline and amorphous planetary materials.  In our case, mechanical properties are contemplated from the perspective of chemical thermodynamics, with deviatoric stress being an additional potential in the Gibbs energy and elasticity, fracture, flow, attenuation/anelasticity, etc., being kinetic responses to dissipate the added mechanical potential.  In reactions, including mechanical ones, kinetic paths produce morphologies (textures) that, in general, are metastable structures &#151; even in nature, even at geological rates.  As a consequence, one must proceed judiciously: application of equilibrium thermodynamics is not always correct.  Current projects include (a) the microphysics behind the attenuation of seismic waves (applied to understanding the structure of Earth's mantle as well as to the energy-dissipation capabilities of the shells of the icy satellites of the outer solar system), (b) redox and cooling dynamics in basaltic liquids and glasses as they affect thermal- and chemical-remanent magnetism, and (c) the role of grain- and heterophase-boundary sliding in affecting and effecting metamorphic layering.

S"My research is focused mainly on changes in cerebral white matter integrity in normal and pathological aging and their impact on cognitive, behavioral, and functional decline in the elderly.  I also have collaborated with other investigators at Brown to study white matter integrity in patients with psychiatric conditions and HIV infection.  In addition, I have worked with colleagues in the Department of Computer Science to develop new methods for quantifying and visualizing higher order diffusion information derived from MRI data.<br /><br />My neuroimaging efforts have focused on diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that provides indirect information about the microstructural integrity of white matter by measuring the magnitude and direction of water diffusion in cerebral tissue.  DTI data can be displayed as two-dimensional maps of scalar parameters (i.e., no vector information), such as Trace (a measure of the magnitude of diffusion in an image voxel), and fractional anisotropy (a measure of the extent to which water diffusion is directionally restricted).  These images can then be interrogated using either region-of-interest approaches or voxel-based methods to detect white matter differences between patients and healthy controls.  DTI has repeatedly been shown to be sensitive to white matter changes that may fall below the threshold of detection on a conventional MRI.  An alternative method of visualizing DTI data is to produce 3D models of white matter fibers.  These computer-generated fibers can be interactively selected and measured for group comparisons &#150; a technique called quantitative tractography.  The DTI work is done in close collaboration with David Laidlaw, Ph.D, and his colleagues in the Brown Department of Computer Science.<br /><br />The majority of work to date has involved examining differences in frontal systems integrity and cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, or early Alzheimer's disease) and subcortical microvascular disease.  Patients with MCI have impairments in memory and/or other cognitive functions but these do not produce sufficient functional decline to warrant a diagnosis of dementia.  These patients are at increased risk for converting to Alzheimer's disease (or other forms of dementia) and there is evidence that those with executive cognitive impairment, which is supported by frontal systems, may be at greatest risk.  DTI and detailed cognitive testing of frontal systems functions may be helpful for identifying these patients, who can then be targeted for more aggressive treatment.  <br /><br />The other main focus has been on patients with white matter injury from subcortical ischemic vascular disease.  These patients have arteriosclerotic or other changes in the small arteries supplying the white matter and subcortical grey matter nuclei.  These vessel changes can lead to hypoperfusive injury or completed lacunar infarction.  The white matter injury is associated with cognitive dysfunction, particularly declines in speed of information processing and executive functions.  My research on vascular white matter injury focuses on understanding the impact of disruption of specific white matter pathways on cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairment.  <br /><br />My work, particularly the focus on vascular white matter injury, is done at Butler Hospital in close collaboration with Stephen Salloway, M.D., professor of clinical neuroscience and Paul Malloy, Ph.D..  I work with other investigators at Brown including Ronald Cohen, Ph.D. who studies white matter injury in patients with HIV infection and with Benjamin Greenberg who studies patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.  I also work closely with Dr. Sean Deoni in the Department of Engineering who has a new MRI method for in vivo assessment of cerebral white matter myelin integrity.<br /><br />A newly developing area of research is in blast-related traumatic brain injury."

S'Large-scale mutagenesis screens in zebrafish have revealed a network of genes that drive early embryonic development.  The dynamics of this network is only partly understood.  In particular, it is not clear how signals are coordinated over longer distances within the embryo.  Our laboratory tests the hypothesis that calcium signals play a role in coordinating multiple signaling pathways during early development.  Calcium signals can spread rapidly over long distances within the embryo and are capable of regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, including secretion, cell motility, and gene expression.  We recently found that calcium signaling during gastrulation plays a critical role in the development of left-right asymmetry in the zebrafish brain.  We aim to better understand the underlying mechanisms and aim to identify genetic and environmental factors that cause asymmetry defects in the developing brain.'

S'GENERAL INTERESTS:<br />     My research is directed at understanding processing mechanisms in thalamus and neocortex.  Techniques include in vitro and in vivo intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology, pharmacology, central microstimulation, anatomy, behavior and channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics.  The goal has been to characterize the organization and operation of thalamo-cortical circuits and to contribute to the understanding of information processing in the forebrain.  <br /><br />AUDITORY FOREBRAIN PLASTICITY IN VIVO:<br />     My graduate work involved the in vivo study of synaptic plasticity in auditory forebrain (Cruikshank, 1997), focusing on contributions of Hebbian induction mechanisms to receptive field changes during behavioral learning (Cruikshank & Weinberger 1996a; 1996b).  I also examined interactions between plasticity and arousal state, including the role of the basal forebrain cholinergic system (Cruikshank & Weinberger, 2001).  Techniques included behavioral (Cruikshank et al., 1992) and neurophysiological methods, involving cell-attached recordings with patch electrodes in vivo, at times from awake guinea pigs.<br /><br />AUDITORY THALAMOCORTICAL ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION:<br />     My intial postdoctoral studies focused on the organization and function of the auditory forebrain (Cruikshank, et. al., 2001).  I helped develop an in vitro auditory thalamocortical slice preparation and used it to examine anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of connections within the system (Metherate & Cruikshank, 1999; Cruikshank et al., 2002).  One major finding was that acetylcholine agonists suppress cortical synaptic responses originating from intracortical sources more strongly than those from thalamic sources (Hsieh, Cruikshank & Metherate, 2000).  This suggests that during periods of high acetylcholine release, such as behavioral arousal, acetylcholine tips the balance in cortex, selectively suppressing ongoing intracortical activity, thus favoring external sensory information. <br /><br />THALAMOCORTICAL MICROCIRCUITRY AND OPTOGENETICS:<br />     As a research professor at Brown University I have worked on three main topics:<br /><br />1.  ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES:  There are two basic modes of synaptic communication: chemical and electrical.  Until recently, most neuroscientists assumed that electrical synapses were limited to a few brainstem areas. This assumption was shattered in 1999 with the discovery of widespread electrical connections between neocortical inhibitory cells (Galaretta & Hestrin, 1999; Gibson et al., 1999).  One of my goals at Brown has been to help understand electrical synapse function in thalamus and cortex (Cruikshank et. al., 2005).  A fundamental part of this has been to characterize the spatial and temporal distributions of gap junctions.  For example, we discovered electrical coupling between thalamic relay cells (Lee, Cruikshank & Connors, 2010), contradicting an emerging consensus that electrical synapses were exclusively located among inhibitory cells of forebrain.  We have also investigated the developmental time course of coupling and the gap junction proteins involved, utilizing connexin knockout mice.  We found dramatic differences in the developmental expression patterns for two highly interconnected thalamic nuclei.  Relay cells of the ventrobasal thalamus undergo a precipitous decline in coupling during the first two postnatal weeks (Lee, Cruikshank & Connors, 2010) whereas inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus maintain stable coupling across the same period despite massive developmental changes in intrinsic cellular properties (Parker, Cruikshank & Connors, 2009).  The pharmacology of electrical synapses is another basic research contribution.  While most blockers of gap junctions have poor specificity, we recently characterized a compound called mefloquine, which we found to be a potent and relatively specific blocker of the neuronal connexin (Cx36)(Cruikshank et al., 2004).  Partly due to our study, mefloquine has become a widely used tool in gap junction research.  Finally, I have also contributed to more direct studies of electrical synapse function.  For example, we found that gap junction-mediated synchrony of neocortical interneurons can synaptically synchronize surrounding excitatory cells (Long, Cruikshank, Jutras & Connors, 2005).  However, we lack a clear understanding of gap junction function in thalamocortical processing (Cruikshank et al., 2005) so this remains an important subject for future research.<br /><br />2.  MECHANISMS OF THALAMOCORTICAL PROCESSING.  The second topic I have pursued at Brown is cortical processing of thalamic input, beginning with the earliest stages: mono- and disynaptic thalamocortical responses in cortical layer 4 (Cruikshank et al., 2007).  My focus has been on interactions between excitatory spiny stellate and inhibitory fast spiking (FS) interneurons, both of which receive monosynaptic thalamic projections and connect to one another.  Thalamocortical responses are much stronger in FS interneurons than in excitatory cells.  I found that this response difference is due to synaptic (rather than intrinsic) mechanisms; thalamocortical input onto FS interneurons is stronger and faster than that onto excitatory cells, partly due to a greater thalamic innervation.  These strong and fast inputs cause FS cells to spike.  FS firing, in turn, produces short latency inhibition on surrounding excitatory neurons, suppressing their responses.  Interestingly, the FS cells also synapse on other FS cells.  However, because thalamocortical synapses onto FS cells have extremely fast kinetics, they are able to fire action potentials before significant feedforward inhibition has time to emerge (Cruikshank Lewis & Connors, 2007).  These discoveries have led to a variety of important issues/questions which provide a basis for much of my current research.<br /><br />3. CORTICAL AND THALAMIC INTERACTIONS STUDIED WITH CHANNELRHODOPSINS.  The third main area I have pursued at Brown is the application of optogenetic technology to understanding thalamocortical microcircuitry.  Over the past few years we have been broadly investigating the utility of genetically encoded, light sensitive, ion channels and pumps as a means of selectively controlling neuronal activity.  One area of major progress has been the use of channelrhodopsins in long range stimulation/mapping experiments.  Channelrodopsins are light-sensitive membrane cation channels that allow for neural activation when illuminated with blue light.  These channels can be densely expressed in axons and terminal arbors of neurons (not just their soma or dendrites) and these axons/arbors can be excited by light even when severed from parent cell bodies.  This feature is highly useful for studying long distance synaptic pathways for which it is difficult or impossible to make brain slices with intact connections between areas of interest.  We have used these methods to compare thalamocortical and corticothalamic processing, revealing contrasting principles of feedforward inhibition in the two pathways (Cruikshank, Urabe, et al., 2010).  We have recently begun applying optogenetic technologies to study other systems that were inaccessible with previous conventional methods. <br /><br /><br /><br />REFERENCES:<br /><br />Cruikshank, S.J.

S'Synthesis and Reactivity of Organic and Inorganic Peroxides; oxidation mechanisms and catalysis; reactive peroxide intermediates.  Our studies are directed toward investigating the properties and the reactivity of new peroxide species which allow selective oxidations. In recent times, our efforts have focused on a new class of reactive organic peroxides that are powerful oxidants and have great potential for synthetic purposes. This is the family of dioxiranes R2CO2, i.e. the smallest ring peroxide species containing carbon. We have produced kinetic, 18O-labeling, reactivity and stereochemical data which stringently indicate that dioxiranes are generated in the reaction of potassium peroxomonosulfate (caroate) with ketones. Then, the feat of isolation of a few dioxiranes from the caroate/ketone system allowed authentic representatives of this family of peroxides to become fully characterized spectroscopically by a combination of techniques, including 17O NMR. The availability of dioxiranes in the isolated as well as in situ form has spurred an intensive utilization of these powerful oxidants to carry out a variety of synthetically useful oxidations under mild conditions. The efficient oxyfunctionalization of simple, unactivated C-H bonds of alkanes under extremely mild conditions undoubtedly counts to date among the highlights of dioxirane chemistry; its features are often biomimetic. Indeed, oxidations of non-activated alkane C-H bonds that are highly selective pertain to a few biological processes which are hard to imitate. To shed light on the origin of these selective oxidations in detail undoubtedly poses a stimulating challenge for our group and for the community of mechanistic chemists.'

S'Professor Curtin\'s research is predominantly in the area of multiscale modeling of the mechanical behavior of materials.  Within this theme lie a number of specific research areas:<br /><br />(i) Multiscale modeling of fracture, from continuum down to atomistic and quantum scales<br />(ii) Multiscale modeling of fiber-reinforced composites<br />(iii) Atomistic modeling of deformation of nanoscale structures<br />(iv) Development of nanotube ceramic matrix composites including atomistic modeling of multiwall nanotubes including interwall coupling<br />(v) Discrete-dislocation modeling of fracture in thin metal films and fatigue crack growth emanating from small inclusions in structural metals such as Al<br />(vi) Strengthening and rate-dependent deformation in metals, with particular emphases on solute strengthening and on dynamic strain aging in Al-Mg and related alloys.<br /><br />Many of these efforts are coupled to experimental studies carried out by collaborators at Brown and elsewhere.<br /><br />A more in-depth discussion of several projects is provided below.<br />1.  Atomistic/Continuum Coupling.  This research focuses on computational methods to connect atomistic-scale and continuum-scale descriptions of material behavior within a unified framework to predict deformation and fracture.  An unique feature of this work is that important phenomena are occurring at multiple scales.  In the Coupled-Atomistic/Discrete-Dislocation (CADD) model developed by Curtin and co-workers, the continuum region deforms according to a discrete-dislocation plasticity description, which captures the small-scale material behavior absent in standard continuum models of plasticity.<br />2.  Discrete/Continuum Coupling.  Material behavior is often controlled by the collective motion of discrete defects, such as dislocations or impurity atoms, at scales above those that can be modeled by fully-atomistic methods.  Discrete-defect models, such as the discrete-dislocation model of Needleman and coworkers, provide a framework for treating such problems.  However, such approaches remain limited in the size scales that can be handled numerically, and are not feasible for direct implementation into engineering design.  Our research is thus aimed at coupling such discrete models directly to "continuum models" in which there are no defects but rather simply field equations and constitutive laws relating, for instance, stress and strain - this is the standard domain of engineering design.  Such a coupling is subtle since one method contains explicit discrete defects and the other does not; averaging methods and proper interfaces between regions of space described by the different methods must be developed.  We have currently accomplished this for both impurity diffusion and dislocation plasticity.<br />3.  Solute strengthening in Aluminum alloys.  Al alloys are lightweight materials with a number of attractive features for many aerospace and automotive applications.  The introduction of solute atoms, such as Mg, into Al provides important strengthening of the material but creates problems in forming the material at room temperature.  The problems arise because the Mg (or other solute atoms) can diffuse, leading to a time-dependent strengthening referred to as Dynamic Strain Aging (DSA).  The specific atomistic-scale mechanisms of strengthening and DSA phenomena are qualitatively understood but quantitative prediction has remained elusive and hence strategies for material design are not based on a solid foundation.  Our research in this area has thus focussed on atomistic modelling of the interactions between Al dislocations and Mg, the most important solute addition in commercial alloys, to uncover the mechanisms of strengthening and DSA.  We have recently found that DSA stems from a very local diffusion of Mg atoms within the very core of Al dislocations, which differs from the traditional view yet leads to quantitative predictions that agree with experimental data on Al-Mg alloys.  Based on this atomistic insight, we have developed higher-scale constitutive models that predict the strain-rate, temperature, strain, and solute concentration, dependence of the material response.  These models are being implemented in continuum-level analysis of test samples to understand the role of dynamic strain aging in driving low ductility and Portevin-LeChatelier instabilities.'

S'Bianca Dahl\'s book project is provisionally entitled, <i>Great Expectations: Humanitarianism and the Invention of AIDS Orphans in Botswana</i>. The manuscript-in-progress is based on over three years of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2003 and 2008. It explores the unexpected effects of foreign-funded institutions that claim to provide culturally sensitive supplemental care for Tswana children who have been orphaned during the HIV epidemic. Moving outside the confines of these organizations by following children into everyday spaces of village life, Dahl\'s research reveals how and why donations of material goods &#150; and the emotional economies that accompany them &#150; are forging newly problematic patterns of social relations in rural Botswana. <i>Great Expectations</i> traces foreign interventions down to the social and emotional changes they bring about within families and in children\'s subjectivities. As orphans lay claim to their increasingly privileged status in surprising ways, Dahl\'s manuscript seeks to show how these young people have become key political actors in shaping the rapidly changing forms of social reproduction during the AIDS epidemic.<br /><br />Dahl\'s second research project &#150; <i>Blood of the Innocents: Stigma and the Unintended Consequences of Biomedical Interventions for HIV-Positive Children in Botswana</i> &#150; delineates some of the sociocultural repercussions of Botswana\'s highly successful Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) program and nationwide antiretroviral drug rollout. This ongoing research tackles a public health puzzle surrounding an unexpected upsurge of stigma against HIV-positive children in rural Botswana, even as the rates of mother-to-child transmission drop and infected children\'s chances of survival dramatically rise (epidemiological factors that are normally associated with <i>decreased</i> stigma). With many villagers convinced that PMTCT\'s successes mean children no longer contract HIV "naturally" from their mothers, this project explores the phenomenon of rapid social amnesia whereby villagers appear to forget that most children contracted HIV before PMTCT was widely implemented. As children infected with HIV grow older, attend schools, and become a visible population in village life, they present new kinds of challenges in rural society. The project asks how and why many Tswana people are drawing on paradigms of witchcraft, adult sexual perversion, and Pentecostal Christianity\'s curative capacities in order to explain &#150; and censure against &#150; the perceived moral decay of their society in the wake of AIDS, which these sick children are said to represent. <br /><br />Dahl\'s research and teaching interests include: HIV & AIDS, children, contemporary social issues in Africa, international development and humanitarian intervention, human rights, medical anthropology, global health, medical humanities, anthropological demography, kinship studies, social stigma, Botswana.'

S'Understanding the catalytic role of ribosomal RNA in protein synthesis was the central focus of my laboratory for a number of years. Our primary approach involved the use of genetic methods, specifically mutagenesis of plasmid-encoded rDNA. We investigated numerous regions of E. coli 16S and 23S rRNA to decipher both the higher order structure and the dynamic aspects of ribosome function. <br /><br />More recently we have developed a similar genetic system in the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus and combined it with X-ray crystallography. We are now able to obtain high resolution crystal structures of mutant ribosomes as we probe sites involved in  tRNA selection, translocation, peptide bond formation and signal transmission within and between the subunits. These same methods are being applied to investigate the mechanism of action and resistance of antibiotics affecting protein synthesis.'

S'Dementia is a chronic illness. Individuals with AD may live years beyond diagnosis with increasing levels of cognitive and functional dependence. Interventions such as medication therapy and surgical procedures may achieve therapeutic or palliative goals of care or may be associated with increased disability in cognitively impaired, medically and pharmacologically complex patients. For most medications and other interventions, geriatric data are sparse in short-term randomized controlled trials (RCT); even less information is available for longitudinal treatment outcomes. Well-designed observational studies can elucidate how well a given intervention works when used by a typical clinician under usual treatment conditions and can help bridge the evidence gaps for populations for which RCT are not feasible. Comparative effectiveness studies that compare short or longer-term alternate treatment strategies can provide important information to inform patient care and health care policy for groups underrepresented or excluded from RCT such as frail, cognitively impaired elderly patients who reside in nursing homes.<br /><br />My research aims are 1) To explore the longitudinal neurobehavioral, cognitive, and functional effects of discontinuing CHEIs compared to continuous long term CHEI therapy in nursing facility residents with dementia, and 2) To determine if cognitively impaired patients receiving certain isoflurane general anesthesia during  surgery experience greater post-operative cognitive and functional decline in the year after surgery compared to patients receiving other types of general anesthesia. A focus of my career development award is conducting observational comparative effectiveness studies that utilize state-of-the-art analytic methods and automated cross-linked Medicare and Medicaid claims datasets.'

S'The general focus of the Darling lab is to understand the relationship between the biological function of cells and tissues and their micro/nano-scale mechanical properties. Specific goals include investigating the mechanical biomarkers associated with stem cells before, during, and after differentiation along various cell lineages. It is possible that cell harvests can even be sorted via mechanical properties to enrich source populations used for tissue engineering and cell therapies. We primarily accomplish these cell-level experiments using atomic force microscopy (AFM), which allows high resolution imaging and force measurements at small scales. Biological experiments involve extended cell culture as well as molecular and biochemical assays. We are also interested in applying a wide range of AFM technologies from cellular manipulation to micropatterning. Our long-term goals are to improve cell-based therapies that can be translated to clinical applications. General areas of interest to the lab include:<br /><br />1. AFM techniques for evaluating the mechanical characteristics of cells and tissues<br />2. Single-cell characterization of normal and diseased/damaged cells<br />3. Stem cell enrichment for improving tissue regeneration approaches<br />4. Understanding the microscale interactions that occur with respect to cell-based therapeutics and tissue engineering procedures<br /><br /><b>Project summaries:</b><br />I. Temporal changes in the biomechanical properties of stem cells during differentiation<br />Previous results have indicated that cells possess distinct mechanical biomarkers that are associated with lineage. Osteoblasts exhibit a larger modulus than chondrocytes, which in turn exhibit a larger modulus than adipocytes. The local environment plays a major role in the expressed phenotype of cells, as do the biochemical stimuli present in the surrounding media. This project investigates how the mechanical properties of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) change during differentiation along three different lineages: osteoblastic, chondrocytic, and adipocytic. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in conjunction with fluorescent imaging will be used to evaluate the mechanical properties of cells, as well as the extent of differentiation within ASC populations.<br /><br />II. Mechanical characterization of the stromal fraction of lipoaspirate<br />ASCs are a promising type of progenitor cell that reside within adipose (fat) tissue. Previous research has indicated that ASCs are a multipotent cell source capable of differentiating along numerous lineages, which combined with its abundance within the body (there is no shortage of fat in America), make it a desirable cell type for cell-based therapies. Harvest of ASCs is relatively simple, involving a short period of tissue dissociation followed by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet is plated in a monolayer environment and sequentially expanded to create the "stem cell" population. The initial purity of these populations is as yet unknown so experiments utilizing these cells can have unpredictable results. This project focuses on the mechanical characterization of primary cell types present within lipoaspirate. AFM will be used to probe single cells for their elastic and viscoelastic properties. Representative cell populations from adipose-associated tissues will be used to establish a library of mechanical traits than can later be applied to the sorting of ASC harvests.<br /><br />III. Investigations into the heterogeneity of adipose-derived stem cell clones<br />A primary goal of the laboratory is to determine whether mechanical biomarkers can be used as a reliable means of determining stem cell differentiation potential. This project will investigate whether single-cell mechanical properties are more consistent within clonal populations than across an entire cell harvest. Heterogeneous, ASC populations will be separated into clonal populations, taking care that each population initially has only a single cell. After approximately twenty doublings, the mechanical characteristics of the cells will be evaluated, as well as the differentiation potential of the population in general. The relationship between mechanical properties and multipotential will be examined across a large number of clones. An alternative (and more difficult) extension to this project is to characterize the mechanical properties of cells prior to the formation of clonal colonies. <br /><br />IV. High-throughput, mechanical sorting of viscoelastic bodies<br />For a cell sorting technique to be successful, it has to either characterize cells very quickly or utilize a highly redundant system. This is also true for a mechanically-based sorting approach. Currently, individual cells are tested one-by-one using an AFM-based approach. While perfectly functional for small sample sizes, it would be impractical to test millions of cells using this technique. Alternative approaches range from simple (deformation-based filters) to complex (multiplexed mechanical assays in a microfluidic environment). The goal of this project is to create a prototype system that can mechanically sort viscoelastic bodies (i.e. cells) at a high enough throughput that manual characterization is surpassed. Ideally, individual cell properties will be recorded during the sorting process, which would allow further characterization of sample cell populations.'

S'Our research focuses on two key areas in cancer research. First, a major goal of our program is the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel agents for the treatment of cancer. Historically, these agents have fallen into 3 broad categories; pyrimidine analogues, camptothecin analogues, and taurolidine and its analogues. Regarding pyrimidine analogues, we have been involved in the development of uracil acyclic nucleosides that have utility in the reduction in host tissue toxicity associated with the administration of selected fluoropyrimidines. Additionally, we have developed thymidine analogues with substituted deoxyribose structures for use in both cancer and AIDS. In our camptothecin program, we have been in the forefront of studies to generate and evaluate analogues possessing stable lactone ring systems. These analogues possess relatively long bio-activity and reduced systemic toxicity. Finally, taurolidine was originally developed nearly 20 years ago as a peritoneal antibiotic. We have observed that this agent also possesses remarkable antineoplastic activity in selected models of metastatic colon and ovarian cancer. Studies are proceeding in the clinical development of this agent and our laboratory is engaged in the design, synthesis, and evaluation of stable metabolic analogues of taurolidine for future use in cancer therapy.<br /><br />The second major research goal in our group is to identify exploitable differences that exist between normal and neoplastic cells in selected key molecular events that govern cell survival and death in response to both normal and therapeutic cues. In this regard, we have made the novel observation that STAT molecules, specifically Stat3, undergo post-translational proteolysis. This leads to (a) reductions in full-length STAT expression and  (b) the generation of STAT cleavage products. Since Stat3 is an oncogene whose expression is associated with the progression from normal to neoplastic phenotypes, our studies to determine the impact of STAT fragment expression on neoplastic cell survival and proliferation hold significant promise in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a variety of human cancers.'

In collaboration with the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the Brain, I developed an fMRI protocol to examine tobacco cue reactivity demonstrating activation of the mesoaccumbens system (ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex) to smoking-related picture cues in addicted smokers and greater activation in these regions in smokers compared to non-smokers [3]. Working with Professors Edith Sim (Pharmacology) and Paul Matthews (Clinical Neuroscience), using Positron Emission Tomography (PET), we demonstrated that a candidate gene polymorphism for nicotine dependence in the serotonin transporter gene had a global and statistically significant effect on binding potential to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor [4], potentially explaining the pharmacogenetic mechanisms underlying differential treatment response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and to the brain\'s response to environmental stimuli related to smoking [5].<br /><br />All of these studies have been part of an integrated approach to translational smoking cessation research spearheaded in the Primary Care Genetics Laboratory and Translational Research Center, which I direct at Brown Medical School.

S"We are using molecular and genetic approaches to gain insight into the mechanisms that control plant growth and development. Many plant signal transduction pathways involve reversible protein phosphorylation events that regulate key steps in development, as well as responses to the environment. The activities of protein phosphatases make important contributions to the regulatory circuitry controlling cell biology and development. It is clear that protein phosphatase activities themselves are tightly regulated. Our goal is to gain insight into the function of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), an enzyme that performs important roles in phosphorylation cascades governing cell proliferation, morphogenesis and cell fate. Our current research focuses on elucidating the biological functions of PP2A in Arabidopsis thaliana, a 'model species' for which a wealth of molecular genetic tools and techniques have been developed, and for which a completed genome sequence is now available. <p>My laboratory is using both molecular genetic and proteomic approaches to study PP2A functions in Arabidopsis. Our analysis of one PP2A mutant has already shown that PP2A activity plays a role in regulating plant responses to gravity, a major environmental cue for plant growth. Genetic experiments also suggest a role for PP2A in embryogenesis. Our studies focus on determining the mechanism through which PP2A activity influences these processes, using analytical tools provided by proteomics and biochemistry, as well as molecular biology and genetics. <p>We are also using a functional genomics approach to isolate new PP2A mutants, to identify additional signal transduction and growth control roles of PP2A. We have systematically analyzed the roles of the three regulatory A subunits of PP2A. Our results suggest that these proteins play overlapping but non-equivalent roles. The RCN1 protein, product of one gene family member, plays a cardinal role in regulation of phosphatase activity, while functions of the other two A subunits are unmasked only when RCN1 is absent. These roles include regulation of embryogenesis, cell expansion and reproductive development."

As a chemistry lab, we exploit our abilities to synthesize DNA lesions and study their properties within well-defined systems.  For instance, we are interested in determining the type and frequency of mutations caused by individual DNA lesions.  Another focus of the lab is on understanding how chemically modifying DNA affects its overall structure and how those modifications influence the inheritance of genetic information.'

S"The study of cosmology has been revolutionized in the past few decades by the vast improvement in telescopes, detectors, and data analysis techniques.  The new observations have confirmed our general picture of the evolution of the universe from a hot, nearly homogeneous initial state, but at the same time presented new puzzles.  First, the mass content of the universe is primarily in some unknown form, called dark matter, which exceeds the ordinary atomic matter by a factor of about 5. Second, the universe is accelerating its expansion, a condition that must be caused by some (unknown) dark energy.  Discovering the nature of the dark matter and the dark energy, and understanding the role they play in the formation of the galaxies, clusters, and superclusters of galaxies we see today is now the most pressing task facing cosmologists. <br /><br />Within this context, I am involved in several projects aimed at addressing the nature of the dark matter and dark energy and the evolution of the structures we see, using a variety of astrophysical techniques.<br /><br />I am involved in two separate major projects that use gravitational lensing to measure the matter and energy content of the universe.<br />Gravitational lensing uses the warping of space-time that Einstein's General Relativity predicts for mass-energy as a tool; by investigating the distortion of distant objects, one can reconstruct the matter and energy that lies between us and the distant universe.<br />In general, the distortions are small, and must be analysed statistically--this is known as the field of weak lensing.<br />The two weak-lensing projects that occupy most of my time are<br />the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), and the Joint Efficient Dark energy Investigation (JEDI).  I am co-PI of the DLS project, and leader of the weak lensing team on the JEDI satellite mission."

S"Katherine Demuth's research centers on the problem of how children acquire language. Much of her work focuses on teasing apart the biological and evironmental contributions to the process. Critical to this research has been crosslinguistic evidence from languages such as Sesotho, Dutch, Spanish, French, and English. These studies have examined both the comparative acquisition of specific linguistic structures as well as the nature of the input children hear. Much of this evidence is drawn from longitudinal case studies of children's spontaneous speech productions. Current research uses theoretical linguistic tools to examine corpus and experimental data in addressing the nature of children's early linguistic representations and how these develop over time.  <br /><br />Some of Demuth's work examines the early acquisition of complex syntactic and morpho-syntactic structures such as verb-argument structure, and the acquisition of grammatical function items. Other research focuses on children's developing phonological systems, how prosodic and articulatory constraints determine early word shape, and the impact of prosodic constraints on the emmergence of grammatical morphemes. Both lines of work find that the frequency of certain linguistic units in the input plays a major role in determining both the rate and course of development, demonstrating the need for a more quantitative approach to issues of language learning."

S'Ever since writing a philological and grammatical commentary of a poem by the late Latin author Paulinus of Nola and a history of the study of the verbal system of classical hieroglyphic Egyptian as licentiate theses in Classics and in "Oriental" studies for the University of Leuven (1979, 1981), my research has focused in no small part, though by no means exclusively, on two facets that are fundamental and foundational to the understanding of ancient civilizations, whose heritage has had to be retrieved from oblivion. They are history, especially the branch of chronology, and language.<br /><br />HISTORY: What really happened? And when? <br /><br />Chronology provides&#151;along with calendrics and ancient astronomy&#151;the framework of history. Our modern calendar, instituted by Caesar in 45 B.C.E., furnishes a kind of continuity back to the time of its beginning that makes chronology much less of a concern to "A.D." historians than to "B.C." historians. To B.C. historians, just determining the order and dates of events is no small matter. <br /><br />LANGUAGE: How was what happened expressed? <br /><br />As for language, the full elucidation of textual materials involves endeavors of many sorts, including the study of manuscript collections and the analysis of the grammatical structure of languages in their synchronic and historical dimensions. <br /><br />It is worth noting that Egyptian has the longest attested history of any of the world\'s languages, spanning 4000 years. Five successive stages are distinguished: Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian, Late Egyptian, Demotic, and Coptic. I have eagerly studied, and written about, all of them. The first four are expressed in hieroglyphic scripts. Coptic is written mainly with the Greek alphabet. Coptic is also by far the most transparent and best known of all the stages. Consequently, the intense study of Coptic can deeply inspire the study of the earlier stages of Egyptian.<br /><br />The Coptic language as well as Coptic or Christian-Egyptian culture in its Christian-Oriental setting, including the study of Syriac and Arabic, have engaged my attention and interest. The published version of my Yale doctoral dissertation is a two-volume catalogue raisonn&#233; (Leuven: Peeters, 1993) of the Coptic collection at the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan. "Pierpont Morgan has often&#151;and justifiably&#151;been referred to," writes the director of the Morgan Library in the foreword to the catalogue, "as the most spectacular collector this country has ever produced. Perhaps the most extraordinary example of this occurred in 1911, when Morgan purchased en bloc most of the ancient Coptic manuscripts which had been discovered . . . on the site of the Monastery of St. Michael near the [Egyptian] village of Hamuli." <br /><br />I have more recently also turned my attention to the grammar of Demotic. In terms of grammar, Demotic seems to be the least studied of the five stages of Egyptian. <br /><br />FOUNDATIONS AND STRUCTURE OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE: The digital analysis of rational thought and language and its relation to pure mathematics, especially probability <br /><br />In recent years, my interest in the phenomenon of language has led to various applications of mathematical logic&#151;including Boolean algebra&#151;to the structure of Egyptian and of languages in general. The aim of these efforts is to increasingly digitalize the analysis of rational thought and language in the footsteps of the inimitable George Boole (1815-1864), the Father of the Digital Age. <br /><br />In support of this effort, I have recently opened up a new line of publication in pure mathematics. The first article is "The Monty Hall Problem and beyond: Digital-Mathematical and Cognitive Analysis in Boole\'s Algebra, Including an Extension and Generalization to Related Cases," Advances in Pure Mathematics, 1/4 (2011) 136-154 (go to www.scirp.org/journal/apm; on the Monty Hall problem, see now Jason Rosenhouse, The Monty Hall Problem: The Remarkable Story of Math\'s Most Contentious Brain Teaser, Oxford University Press, 2009). <br /><br />A branch of mathematics that is of particular relevance to the proposed deeply digital character of rational thought and language is probability theory. It will be useful to reexamine the foundations of probability theory and offer an alternative to the efforts by Andrei Kolmogorov (1903-1987) in his Foundations of the Theory of Probability (1956, second edition, from the German of 1933) to define them. Among the many interesting problems for which new definitions could be proposed is the Law of Large Numbers. Anyone flipping a coin 1000 times will reasonably expect to obtain heads roughly 500 times and tails roughly 500 times. But no one in their right mind would feel entitled to expect tails in a second toss after obtaining heads in a first. Why is that? <br /><br />It is remarkable how insecure, and on occasion misrepresented, the foundations of probability theory remain even after the numeric pyrotechnics of the formidable De Moivre ((1667-1754) and the most recondite lucubrations of the great Laplace (1749-1827). Inverse probability and conditional probability are of special concern. Other facets remain open to reevaluation. For example, the mathematical analysis of the well-known Birthday Problem in handbooks of probability and statistics remains inadequate. <br /><br />As regards rational thought and language, I have had the opportunity to present my theory on how the biological brain reasons in 2010 in a lecture at the Korean Institute of Science and Technology Europe (KIST) located on the campus of the University of Saarbruecken, Germany. According to this theory, four digital operations underlie all rational (not emotional) thought and language. The digital code can be presented as four letters, not A C G T as in the genetic code of DNA, but S P A C, and always in that order. What the brain does when it is thinking is to spac, if the neologism is allowed. The brains learns how to spac in grade school or perhaps earlier and the neurons happily keep spacking away for a lifetime. <br /><br />In this connection, an interesting question to an Egyptologist is whether human thought can be observed to have become slightly more sophisticated in the past 5000 years, as it definitely has since the Neanderthals. I rather believe that it has.<br /><br />CODA<br /><br />Meanwhile, the cause of Egyptology and Ancient Western Asian Studies must go on. A study entitled "Why Greek Lunar Months Began a Day Later than Egyptian Lunar Months, Both before First Visibility" is concerned with the lunar calendars of Egypt, the Greek world, and Mesopotamia and is nearing publication and so is an article entitled "Viva Rosetta! Demotic Grammar in the Twenty-first Century: Problems and Prospects." The whole world knows the Rosetta Stone. But how many people know that its center portion is inscribed with a language called Demotic? And who cares that Demotic seems to be one of the world\'s least studied written idioms (especially if one considers that so many Demotic texts are extant) or that it is a stage of a language, Egyptian, whose history is the longest attested of any ever spoken?'

S'Professor Der Derian is currently involved in 3 major projects underway at the Watson Institute:<br /><br />-Information Technology, War, and Peace Project<br />In the twenty-first century, information technology (IT) has become an essential tool for the global circulation of power, waging of war, and imagining of peace. Since the 1990s, IT has taken a more potent role in the organization, execution, justification, and representation of violence worldwide as witnessed in the first Gulf War, Bosnia, Kosovo air campaign, and the terrorist attacks on September 11. The recent war in Iraq revealed an unprecedented infiltration of IT into all aspects of warmaking. Whether in military technology and intelligence capturing, embedded journalist and 24/7 newsmaking, or organizational strategies for peacemaking, the second Gulf War was the first, but certainly not the last, web war. <br /><br />The Watson Institute\'s Information Technology, War, and Peace Project (InfoTechWarPeace) was created three years ago to track and analyze IT\'s influence on traditional statecraft and new forms of networked global politics. InfoTechWarPeace challenges the traditional discourse on world order, which is defined by state-centric, realist interpretations of power. Yet, in the past decade and especially since September 11, very different global actors have emerged ranging from fundamentalist terrorists to peace activists, who gain advantage through the broad bandwidth of information technology rather than through traditional state-centered sovereignty. The Project interrogates how these individuals and groups make use of IT to influence world politics. http://www.infopeace.org <br /><br />-Global Media Project<br />In 2005, Watson Institute\'s Global Security Program developed a new crosscutting research initiative, the Global Media Project (GMP). The project is built upon three core assertions: <br /><br />    The media&#151;from print and online journalism to cable and satellite news to cinematic film and video documentaries&#151;have become increasingly interconnected and all the more powerful as global actors. <br /><br />    Since 9/11 the media are a critical component of global terrorism and the war against it. <br /><br />     In critical matters of war and peace there is an increased need not only to understand media in but also to create public media for international affairs. <br /><br />In an age defined by networks of information and terror, getting the message right is no longer sufficient; understanding, producing and rapidly distributing global-interest media is also required.<br />http://watsoninstitute.org/globalmedia/<br /><br />-Cultural Awareness in the Military<br />In a range of deployments since the early 1990s&#151;to Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and now Iraq and Afghanistan&#151;the U.S. military has been tasked with making peace as well as waging war. From the transformation of conventional war-fighting to counter-insurgency and stability operations, the military has been coming to terms with the importance of culture across a wide spectrum of social relationships. Since 2003, "cultural sensitivity" has become a key component of training for troops deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, having identified a "culture gap" in U.S. military capability, high-ranking military and congressional leaders have begun to advocate new training and educational programs to promote understanding of the "cultural terrain" navigated by the military. <br /><br />All this raises new questions for social scientists concerned with the use (and potential abuse) of the concept of "culture" by the U.S. military. In 2004, the Politics, Culture and Identity Program launched a project with the Global Security Program, which set out to investigate the ethical, practical, and technological issues raised by the military\'s quest for greater cultural awareness.'

S'Dr. Diaz\' current research projects focus on colon cancer screening and screening disparities.  He is in the process of developing and validating a bilingual (English and Spanish) survey instrument to evaluate the effectiveness of colorectal cancer decision aids for patients considering screening. His current study, "Colorectal Cancer Decision Aids in Primary Care", focuses on: (1) identifying patients\' beliefs and potential misconceptions about colorectal cancer screening via focus groups; (2) developing an evidence-based instrument to measure patients\' knowledge, judgments and level of decisional conflict regarding screening; and (3) via a cross-sectional study of primary care patients, validating the instrument and simultaneously assessing patients\' baseline levels of knowledge, judgments, and decisional conflict about colorectal cancer screening. Once developed, the instrument will help to elucidate how colorectal cancer screening decision-aids impact the decision making process by examining potential mediating variables between decision aids and eventual screening behaviors. Thus, the instrument will be an important asset in the process evaluation of current and future colorectal cancer decision aids.'

S"Susan Dickstein is Director of the Bradley Hospital Early Childhood Clinical Research Center (ECCRC), part of the Bradley/Hasbro Research Center, devoted to the study of the development of young children at risk for behavioral, developmental, and psychiatric disorders.  Emphasis is placed on behavioral processes that support the intergenerational transmission of illness by assessing individual, relationship, and family factors. Her clinical and research work focuses on the prevention and treatment of adverse developmental outcomes in children from birth to five years old.  She specializes in conducting research and clinical interventions with children from high-risk families, typically those in which the mother is depressed or those living in impoverished circumstances.  She has collaborated on several National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants within the realm of developmental psychopathology, attachment theory, family risk, maternal depression, and early childhood mental health issues. <br /><br />The ECCRC provides clinical services to young children (infants, toddlers, and preschoolers) with behavioral, emotional, and/or developmental difficulties, and their families.  Services are provided through direct therapeutic intervention with children and families; standardized child developmental evaluations and family assessments; and community-based consultation to Head Start, Early Head Start, and other local early childhood agencies regarding classroom functioning, child and family development, staff training, program planning, and program evaluation.  The ECCRC provides community-based professional training on issues such as child and family assessment, normative and atypical child development, parent-child and family relationships, behavior management strategies, and family risks.  Finally, ECCRC clinicians are trained to implement the Incredible Years Series, an empirically validated preventive intervention model designed to address multiple contextual risk factors that are known to compromise a young child's ability to succeed in school by 1) promoting effective parenting practices, parent-school connections, and healthy family functioning and 2) enhancing social-emotional competence and behavioral regulation in preschoolers in home and school settings.<br /><br />Susan Dickstein is currently the principal investigator on an Administration for Children and Families (ACF) grant to assess child outcomes in Head Start as a function of program evaluation practices. More specifically, this project examines the impact of an intervention designed to enhance Head Start teachers' ability to use a classroom-based system of tracking and monitoring child developmental progress (Head Start MAP:0-5) for child outcomes.  The intervention is a manualized, domain-specific approach to providing teacher feedback, supervision, and training that specifically links an on-going program evaluation system with improved child outcomes by targeting teachers' ability to: 1) enhance child developmental performance, 2) individualize curricula, and 3) maintain optimal classroom learning environments. <br /><br />Susan Dickstein has also conducted National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded longitudinal investigations exploring the impact of maternal psychopathology on child and family developmental outcomes. Focus has been on the extent to which levels of family functioning are inter-related and impact child outcomes.  Further, specific examination has been made of the extent to which marital attachment may function as a protective factor in the transmission of insecure attachment relationships across generations. She has developed unique interview methods (Marital Attachment Interview) as well as family observational coding systems (Mealtime Interaction Coding System); and has participated in the Family Narrative Consortium (funded by the MacArthur Foundation) to develop narrative-based assessment protocols.<br /><br />As a member of the Brown University's clinical psychology internship and postdoctoral program, Dickstein coordinates and supervises a unique early childhood training experience focused on community-based consultation to agencies serving high-risk children, from birth to five years old, and their families."

S'In 1898 Alexander Graham Bell found that when an infrared active gas is exposed to modulated radiation, a periodic heating of the gas takes place causing sound waves to be generated. This process of sound wave generation, now known as the photoacoustic effect, is quite general and can be initiated in liquids and solids as well as gases. Perhaps the outstanding feature of the photoacoustic effect is its remarkable sensitivity when a laser is used as the optical source.  We recently have been investigating another fascinating property of the photoacoustic effect. When a pulsed laser irradiates a particle, the time profile of the emitted pressure wave is determined by both the geometry of the particle and its acoustic properties. The first stage in the research done here was development of theory for determining the time profiles of the waves by solving the wave equation for pressure. Later, experiments with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser were carried out to verify the theory and to find its limitations. Thus, an analytical technique, a kind of spectroscopy of particles, has been developed whereby a recording of a photoacoustic wave can be used to determine the geometry of a body, its sound speed, and density.  A development that came as a result of the work with particles was the investigation of a photoacoustic device that acted as an acoustic laser. That is, when layers of a weak optical absorber are juxtaposed between transparent layers that have identical acoustic transit times, the acoustic reflections add coherently in time. Thus, if the layered structure is irradiated by a laser modulated at the correct frequency, a highly directional acoustic beam with many of the properties of a distributed feedback laser is produced.  We have also investigated the photoacoustic effect that is produced in India ink, which is a suspension of carbon in water. We have found a surprising "giant" photoacoustic effect where the amplitude of the effect is roughly 2000 times as large as it would normally be in a dye solution. The remarkable size of the effect comes as a result of chemical reactions that take place between carbon and water at the high temperatures produced by the laser. The mix of reaction products turns out to be fascinating in itself - the  pulsed laser creates conditions of high pressure and temperature where a distribution of products is produced that is not found under any other laboratory conditions. <br /><br />We are initiating a program of tissue imaging using the ultrasonic vibration potential in colloidal suspensions.  The work is motivated by the search for more sensitive methods for detection breast tumors&#151;methods to detect the presence of tumors at their earliest stages of development.  The primary difficulty in using x-rays for mammography is that the contrast mechanism for distinguishing tumors from healthy tissue depends on density differences, which are not so large as to allow early detection. The vibration potential offers the possibility of high sensitivity detection precisely as a result of its contrast mechanism. We have found that the ultrasonic vibration potential is roughly fifty times that for muscle and fatty tissue. Since tumors are highly vascularized, that is, they are surrounded by a large network of blood vessels, hence, a detector of blood concentration becomes a detector of tumors. <br /><br />Colloids are suspensions of charged particles in a liquid with a counter charge distributed in the fluid around each particle.  The counter charge, which is normally a spherical distribution around the particles, gives the solution overall charge neutrality and stabilizes the suspension against particle agglomeration.  When sound propagates through a suspension where the particles have either a higher or lower density than that of the surrounding fluid, the amplitude and phase of the particle motion, owing to the difference in inertia between the particle and the volume of fluid it displaces, differs from that of the fluid so that fluid flows back and forth relative to the particle on alternating phases of the acoustic cycle.  Since the counter charge is carried by the fluid, the oscillatory motion of the fluid relative to the particle distorts the normally spherical counter charge distribution creating an oscillating dipole at the site of each particle, which, added over a half wavelength of the sound wave, results in a macroscopic voltage that can be recorded by a pair of electrodes placed in the solution. <br /><br />We also have a program for the use of x-ray phase contrast to detect tumors.  X-ray phase contrast imaging refers to using the phases introduced in an x-ray beam as it traverses a body to give contrast.  All materials have indices of refraction (at any wavelength) which determine the amount of refraction a beam of radiation passing through the body.  X-radiation as it passes through a body is deflected as it passes through soft tissue an amount that depends on the presence of density gradients.  The most visible features of this deflection process are seen in the image where there are interfaces between two materials of different density. Conventional x-ray mammograms do not show the effects of the bending of the trajectories of the x-rays in the images because of the large size of the radiation source&#151;essentially, the fine phase contrast features are averaged out by the large source size of a conventional x-ray tube.  The advantages of the unique contrast mechanism are being explored for use as an early tumor detection method.'

S'Systems of principal concern in our research involve interfacial and cluster phenomena. Metal/hydrogen materials are of special interest in our research owing to their phenomenological richness and experimental accessibility. Furthermore, such systems serve as a valuable prototype for the development of the tools necessary for the study of intrinsically quantum mechanical many-body dynamical processes. Current studies utilize both empirical and ab initio theoretical models of the microscopic forces in conjunction with equilibrium and dynamical path integral methods to examine the structural, spectroscopic, and transport properties of such systems. Another area of special interest involves a series of investigations of what might be termed theoretical "landscaping". In chemical or biological problems, a common task is to determine the minimum energy configuration of a complex molecular potential energy surface or "landscape". Such minimization tasks are of general significance in science, and, not surprisingly, have spawned an enormous amount of research within the applied mathematics communities. Although still an active area, these efforts provide us with a broad understanding of the relationship between the general features of the potential energy landscape and the complexity of the associated minimization problem. We seek to reverse the logic of the minimization problem. That is, instead of searching for the minimum energy structures of specified energy landscapes, we strive instead to reshape those landscapes and thereby to exercise control over selected physical systems. In particular, we seek to stabilize and/or kinetically trap conformers that are otherwise either un- or metastable. The chemical, magnetic, and electronic properties of small clusters are often sensitive to their physical structure. Consequently, if we can demonstrate their selective preparation, such metastable species could, in principle, provide the starting point for the assembly of a wide range of novel materials.'

S'Human survival capabilities depend on a fundamental skill of the visual system: interpreting retinal images in order to extract knowledge about the 3D structure of the environment that surrounds us.  Understanding how this process is carried out by the perceptual system has always been the main focus of Fulvio Domini research.  In the last twenty years the vision community has approached this problem by making, implicitly or explicitly, three fundamental assumptions. First, since a mathematical analysis of different properties of retinal images, also called signals, indicates that these properties are sufficient for deriving the veridical structure of the objects that project on the retina there must be independent modules that perform such analysis.  Second, these modules operate in a fairly instantaneous and spatially localized fashion.  Third, the outputs of independent modules are combined at the very last stage of visual processing in order to provide a unique and veridical 3D representation of projected objects. In several published journal articles Fulvio Domini has provided empirical results, accounted for by alternative theoretical frameworks that challenge these assumptions. <br /><br />Fulvio Domini started his research career by investigating the first hypothesis. Specifically, he became intrigued with the problem of how the visual system extracts shape from dynamic properties of retinal images.  It is well known that moving features on a flat image can induce a vivid impression of a three-dimensional structure.  For many decades, theoretical and empirical investigations into this ability have interpreted these percepts as faithful copies of the projected 3D structures.  In a series of investigations Fulvio Domini has provided empirical evidence that proves this interpretation non-biologically plausible.  Moreover, he has developed a new theory of human processing of structure from motion that can predict previously reported findings and these new results.  The most important and puzzling result that can be predicted by this new theory is that human observers judge local 3D properties of a smooth surface in a way that is inconsistent with how the surface is perceived as a whole.  In other words he has provided empirical results that resemble the "ever ascending" staircase of the Dutch painter M.C. Esher.  While this result is perfectly predicted on a local level by the model he developed, it seems to clash with the phenomenic experience of a perceived smooth global surface.  <br /><br />This perceptual paradox made Fulvio Domini revisit again the second commonly held assumption described above and he concluded that the visual system does not analyze the image in a strictly local fashion.  Similar considerations made him think that information for 3D shape is not processed instantaneously.  He therefore received a NSF grant that allowed him to investigate processes of spatial or temporal integration for the perception of 3D shape. In a series of studies on this problem he discovered three important sets of findings.  First, motion information for the perception of 3D structure is not processed instantaneously, but effects of temporal integration can be found for a temporal window that can span up to one second.  Second, a similar process of temporal integration exists when binocular information is followed or preceded in time by motion information.  Third, global structure from motion can be predicted by considering a process of spatial integration acting on local and non-veridical measurements of surface shape.<br /><br />The results of Fulvio Domini\'s studies on structure-from-motion made him think again about the above-mentioned third hypothesis, that postulates a modular organization of 3D shape perception processing.  The fact that structure-from-motion is, in general, non-veridical seems at odds with the idea of having a separate SFM module.  What would the role of that module be? How can a non-veridical output be combined with the outputs of other modules?  Moreover, he realized that investigations on depth-cue integration have been plagued with contradictory findings, where the reports consistent with the predictions of an optimal combination of independent depth estimates clashed with reports of interactions among depth modules.  He is currently developing a new conceptual framework in which such contradictions may be resolved.  According to this proposal, the visual system takes advantage of the natural co-variation that exists among image signals.  Fulvio Domini calls these co-variations intrinsic constraints because they represent relationships among image measurements.  These co-variations identify a lower dimensional manifold in the multi-dimensional space of signals.  Domini\'s hypothesis is that the visual system derives 3D properties from measurements on this lower dimensional manifold.  He is currently investigating this problem with the additional support of a grant that he has recently received by the National Science Foundation'

S"John E. Donahue, M.D. is a neurologist-neuropathologist who currently studies Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  He has shown that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin, an important component of the vascular basal lamina, is fragmented in AD brain capillaries.  Furthermore, he has also demonstrated that there is an alteration of the distribution of BBB amyloid-beta transporters RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) and LRP-1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1) in AD.  RAGE, which transports amyloid into the brain, is upregulated in the microvasculature of AD brains, while LRP-1, which transports amyloid out of the brain, is downregulated, leading to a net influx of amyloid into AD brains, further worsening the disease.  Given that apolipoprotein E (apoE) is essential for maintaining BBB integrity, and that the apoE4 allele is a known risk factor for AD, Dr. Donahue is currently hypothesizing that the apoE4 allele is not as effective at keeping the BBB sealed, compared with the more common apoE3 allele, thus leading to the chain of events resulting in AD.<br /><br />Dr. Donahue aims to become an expert in the BBB, to understand that particular anatomic structure and how neurologic function occurs, or does not occur, because of it.  The BBB is a very underdeveloped and underappreciated area of neuroscience; less than 5% of abstracts submitted to the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting involve BBB research, yet the BBB is critically important in that its function leads to function of the brain, and its dysfunction leads to dysfunction of the brain."

S"John E. Donahue received his M.D. from Tufts University in 1992.  He trained in neurology at Tufts-New England Medical Center and in neuropathology at Rhode Island Hospital.  After spending four years at the New Jersey Neuroscience Institute as Director of Neuropathology, he returned to RIH/Brown Medical School in 2003 to practice clinical neuropathology and pursue academic research in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) and the blood-brain barrier.  Being both a neurologist and neuropathologist enables him to bring a clinical perspective to neuropathology material and an underlying pathologic understanding to clinical material.  Translational research in neurodegenerative diseases is ideally-suited for a neurologist-neuropathologist like him.  This is a very rare combination in the 21st century; most newly-trained neuropathologists are trained in general anatomic and surgical pathology, not neurology."

My research will attempt to show that the product of the &#949;4 allele of the APOE gene, a known risk factor for developing AD, somehow fails to maintain the integrity of the BBB, compared to the &#949;3 allele, and that this BBB failure leads to the chain of events resulting in AD."

S"Donoghue's laboratory builds on pioneering research in neurotechnology. Brown, which has established a team of internationally recognized scientists and engineers in this emerging field, seeks to develop brain machine interfaces that can restore independence to paralyzed humans and potentially augment human capabilities.<br /><br />Spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and related nervous system diseases are disabling disorders of movement that currently affect millions of people in the United States. Donoghue's lab investigates how the brain turns thought into voluntary behaviors.  At the core of this problem is understanding higher level neural coding &#151; or how populations of neurons represent complex information.  To study neural coding, scientists in the lab are developing novel multielectrode recording arrays suitable for chronic implantation in the cerebral cortex. The lab is using these multielectrode arrays to examine the coding of goal-directed reaching by ensembles of cerebral cortical neurons and to examine how ensembles change when a new motor skill is learned.  <br /><br />The laboratory works closely with several other Brown Brain Science faculty members to develop and test theories of higher order representation and to generate new mathematical tools to examine neural codes.  Brain Science faculty also are applying the laboratory's knowledge of neural codes for movement to build brain computer interfaces.  These devices can potentially be used as a neural prosthetic to restore movement to paralyzed humans.  Along with a synergy of talent from the departments of Neuroscience, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and the Medical School, Donoghue's laboratory recently demonstrated the neurotechnology of these devices in landmark proof of concept experiments (Nature 2002).  Using this innovative technology, nonhuman primates (monkeys) were able to play videogames directly through brain outputs.  The signals are retrieved by unique microelectronic circuitry, and decoded by advanced mathematical and computational techniques.  Technologies enable neural signals from a normal brain to bypass injured or diseased spinal cord, nerves, or muscle to provide a new output that can control artificial limbs, robotic equipment, or even the patient's own muscles.  The devices can potentially be applied to remote control of computer interfaces or semiautonomous air or sea craft.  With colleagues, Donoghue formed a new company (Cyberkinetics, Inc.) that will use tiny arrays of electrodes to capture the information encoded in the firing patterns of populations of neurons to control a computer and thence any device that can be computer controlled."

My principal area of research interest is the non-experimental study of drug effects, with applications to drug safety and comparative effectiveness research. Most of my work has involved understanding and using health insurance claims data for this purpose. My methodological expertise covers topics related to studying medical interventions in the setting of non-randomized treatment groups and incomplete data (i.e., claims data).  My work has been published in several journals, including the Annals of Internal Medicine, and I serve as a peer-reviewer for a range of clinical and epidemiologic journals. <br /><br />Prior to joining the Brown faculty full-time in 2011, I worked as Senior Scientist at OptumInsight Epidemiology (formerly i3 Drug Safety), an independent research consultancy that conducts pharmacoepidemiologic studies for the biopharmaceutical industry, mostly in the area of drug and vaccine safety. In my consulting practice, I led several post-approval safety studies of drugs and vaccines.  Essentially all of his work was based in commercial health insurance claims data and supplemented with information from abstracted medical records.  In the case of two projects, I coordinated other research groups, requiring the development of study designs that allowed pooling of aggregate-level data across sites to preserve patient confidentiality. <br /><br />The US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies worldwide have been principal consumers of my research output, and I remain involved with independent, industry-funded drug and vaccine safety research as PI or site PI of several ongoing projects.

S'Lance Dworkin, M.D., serves as director of nephrology at Rhode Island Hospital and is a lead investigator in an effort to identify the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in chronic renal injury.  In collaboration with Rujun Gong, he directs studies examining the effects of HGF on the molecular mechanism(s) governing matrix synthesis and degradation and in renal epithelial cells as they relate to renal fibrosis and scarring.  Gong and Dworkin are also examining the role of HGF in modulating renal inflammation and the inflammatory phenotype in renal epithelial and endothelial cells.  Interstitial inflammation is an invariable finding in kidneys progressing to end stage renal failure, and interventions that modulate this inflammatory response may lead to novel therapies to help slow progression of chronic renal disease.  They are also investigating the significance of endothelial dysfunction as a key contributor to renal disease progression.  They hypothesize that endothelial cells generate inflammatory cytokines that then promote inflammation and kidney injury.  Studies in vivo have been extended to an in vitro model system of bovine glomerular endothelial cells in culture where the pathological cascades involved in endothelial cell dysfunction can be systematically studied.<br />&#9;<br />As a clinical investigator, Lance Dworkin also directs a clinical trials program examining the treatment of various forms of hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He is currently the study chair and senior leader for the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) study, a large multicenter clinical trial funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) that will compare angioplasty and stenting plus optimal medical therapy to medical therapy alone for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.  This study will enroll approximately 1100 patients at up to 100 centers across the United States.  Other recent or current clinical trials have examined the impact of various antihypertensive agents or lipid lowering drugs on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension and/or chronic renal disease.'

S'CUREENT PROJECTS AND INTERESTS<br />At Brown deBenedette collaborated with colleagues Beth Bauer and Shoggy Waryn to establish Russian, Spanish and French versions of the online intercultural exchange "Cultura" (originally developed at MIT for French). Cultura draws on constructivist approaches to language learning, and the social network created by the exchange allows for a community of multilingual and -cultural participants (US students of Russian at Brown / Russian students of English in a Russian city) to explore the cultural "baggage" even the most basic terms carry, both for individuals and groups. <br /><br />If Cultura takes on the larger issues of remaking foreign language curricula (in order to, as a recent Modern Languages Association report put it, "situate language study in cultural, historical, geographic, and cross-cultural frames,") there is a concurrent need  in foreign language education to focus on the traditionally regarded "building blocks" of language study, among them instruction in grammar. Traditional approaches have remained largely mechanical, involving rule memorization and application, often in exercises that do nothing to ensure that a grammatical form (a case ending or tense marker, for example) has been mapped correctly to the meaning it encodes. Meanwhile research in language acquisition has established that neither rule memorization nor mechanical drilling leads directly to competent interaction in a foreign language. Structred Input and Processing Instruction (VanPatten, 2004) seek to remake grammar instruction by focusing on the places where learners process forms incorrectly. Activities require students to demonstrate comprehension of new forms used in some meaningful context before they have any need to use the forms in speaking or writing themselves. SI and PI activities now exist in quantity for Spanish and French, but research on how best to create these activities is only beginning in less-commonly taught languages like Russian.'

S'At the Watson Institute, Eckert co-directs the projects on Targeted Sanctions, Terrorist Financing, and Economic Security. <br /><br />The Targeted Sanctions Project engages actively with the United Nations to strengthen the instrument of targeted sanctions.   Working with international experts and the United Nations Secretariat, project investigators have developed a manual for the design of targeted financial sanctions, studied the legislative and regulatory systems of states to develop best practices in the implementation of targeted sanctions, and conducted workshops and simulations for the UN Security Council.  Most recently, the project surveyed the practices of UN Sanctions Committees and recommended measures to strengthen targeted sanctions through fair and clear procedures.<br /><br />The Terrorist Financing Project focuses on ways to combat the financing of global terrorism.  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and those since, have heightened concerns about the ability of terrorist organizations to use the global financial system to support their activities. In response, international initiatives to combat terrorism have focused on preventing and suppressing the collection and movement of terrorist funds. This effort raises important questions: What are the sources of terrorist funds? How do networks for terrorist financing operate? How can they be regulated? Building on the Targeted Sanctions Project, the Targeting Terrorist Finances (TTF) Project investigates these questions.  <br /><br />The TTF Project hosted a series of workshops on the "Financial and Transnational Dynamics of Terrorism." (co-sponsored by the Harvard\'s Kennedy School of Government) in which participants presented research on the financial and social organization of terrorism in transnational comparative perspective.  The results of these workshops is a co-edited volume with Thomas Biersteker, Countering the Financing of Global Terrorism, which will be available in early 2007.<br /><br />In conjunction with the U.S. Naval War College, Eckert also co-directs an economic security project.  A workshop, "The Political Economy of the New Security Environment" was held in 2003, the results of which were published in "Guns & Butter: The Political Economy of International Security", edited by Peter Dombrowski.  A follow-up workshop is being organized for late 2006 on Maritime Security.'

S'My paintings focus on the interaction of color relationships on multi-layered surfaces.  I am interested in visual information dealing with patterning and repetition, and often find inspiration for my work in nature, textiles, and embellished ornamentation. My work is often included in exhibitions with titles such as "Obsession," which investigate the repetitive and labor-intensive elements in my drawings and paintings. <br /><br />Between 2001 and 2006, I explored an unconventional application of materials&#151;oil paint extruded onto the surface of the canvas rather than applied via brush&#151;which created a net-like image on top of multiple, transparent layers of underpainting. These nets take on undulating qualities, bringing to mind a body in water, or alternately vein-like vascular systems. The layering process refers to separations between boundaries, while the net implies a potential for capture, enclosure, containment.'

S'Areas of Interest: methods and statistics, social psychology, the self and its relation to social systems.  <br /><br />I am a social psychologist whose areas of teaching and research address in various ways two fundamental questions of human concern: "Who am I?" and "Where do I fit in?"  In my research, I investigate the self-concept, its development in youth and its effects on behavior; issues of fairness in social relationships; issues of self and social integration, including the individual and community, alienation, and civility; and the personal consequences of experiencing the social structure. My most recent research includes a study of mattering (the sense that one is a significant part of the lives of other people, institutions, one\'s community, or society as a whole) and its effects on adolescent behavior; in particular, I will soon have published a book (Wiley-Blackwell) studying anti-social and self-destructive behavior among young people (ages 12-18).  Based on a national survey of 2004 adolescents and one parent (figure), and using an index to measure mattering that I have developed, the book details the strong negative effects of failing to matter to family  and friends on a wide range of dysfunctional behaviors, including violence (within and without the family), alcohol use, binge drinking, illegal substance use, suicide attempts. I am also currently publishing research on child maltreatment; the latest published article reveals that those young people who are physically abused develop a sense of social isolation from other people and school as a social institution.'

As a foundation for this work, I recently completed data collection regarding differential stress and burden in family caregivers of hospitalized elderly compared with family caregivers of outpatients.  Currently, I am collaborating with other Brown University investigators regarding development of interventions to 1) reduce rehospitalization for dementia and 2) reduce depressive symptoms for family caregivers of inpatients.  I have written and contributed to manuscripts regarding the nature and treatment of geriatric depression, the prediction of depression in family caregivers, and use of the biological markers in the study of psychotic depression and schizophrenia.  I teach general psychiatry residents and geriatric psychiatry fellows, and I recently served as co-director of the Alpert Medical School's Scholarly Concentration in Contemplative Studies for medical students."

She also studied the binding of metal ions to DNA, RNA, and synthetic polynucleotides using NMR. She studied 50 S ribosomal proteins using immunochemical techniques. More recent research interests include the pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of gold lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis, and clinical manifestations of human parvovirus infection. She lectures extensively on the rheumatic diseases and especially on osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, the COX-2 inhibitors and the newer therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.<br /><br />As co-principal investigator for a major seven years( 2002-2009) NIH-NIAMS grant of 8.96 million dollars, on the Osteoarthritis Initiative, based at Memorial Hospital of RI, Dr Estrup and her colleagues will try to uncover the biological markers that help predict who will develop the most common form of arthritis. They will study surrogate markers for osteoarthritis of the knees in 1,250 subjects over the age of 50 who do not have the diagnosis of osteoarthritis initially, but who will eventually develop the disease over the study period. A subgroup of subjects with mild or early osteoarthritis will be studied to follow the progression of the disease. Subjects will be chosen if they have one of the following risk factors, such as a history of trauma, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or a family history of osteoarthritis. X-rays and MRIs of the knees, as well as blood studies for genetic and biochemical markers, will be obtained to eventually help predict who is most likely to develop osteoarthritis.<br /><br />Publications in some of the following Journals:<br />Biophysica et Biochimica Acta<br />Journal of Chemical Physics<br />Journal of Molecular Biology,<br />AMA Journal of Internal Medicine.<br />Annals of Rheumatic Diseases<br />Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism<br />Journal of Rheumatology"

S'Surfaces - their physical properties and chemical reactions - present us with problems that are both of fundamental scientific interest and of great technological importance. Thanks to the development of techniques capable of exploring the interface on an atomic scale, solutions to many of these problems are now within reach.  Our research focuses on experimental studies of metal and semiconductor surfaces and seeks to provide realistic models for the description of the gas-solid interface, including processes such as chemisorption, film growth, and two-dimensional phase transitions.  A chemisorbed atom or molecule experiences forces due to the adsorbent (adatom-substrate interactions) and to the other adsorbed species (adatom-adatom interactions). The bonding to the substrate is investigated by measurements of the desorption energy and by vibrational (IR and electron energy loss) spectroscopy. Adatom-adatom interactions modify the bonding; they also manifest themselves in the two-dimensional arrangement of the adatoms which can be determined by LEED and, in special cases, by x-ray diffraction (As an illustration, the photograph below shows an intriguing diffraction pattern from chlorine layer adsorbed on a tungsten(100) surface.  Surprisingly complex behavior is often observed, particularly on metal surfaces. This has now been shown to be caused by ""reconstruction"": depending on the temperature and adatom density the surface metal atoms are displaced from their normal lattice positions, thereby lowering the free energy. The effects are dramatic. For example, when H2 and O2 adsorb on Mo(100) the molecules dissociate and the H and O adatoms then segregate to form ""islands"" of pure hydrogen and pure oxygen. A study of the involvement of the substrate degrees of freedom  adsorption phenomena in general, is one of the important directions of the present research program.  Another objective of our current research is the study of the rate at which the various surface phases form. To this end, electron probes having nano-or picosecond resolution are being developed in a collaboration with Professor Peter Weber.'

S"A novel therapy for Muscular Dystrophy<br /><br />Our lab is working to develop a novel therapy for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which strikes one in 3,000 boys.  In previous work we are characterized a new extracellular component of  the dystrophin complex, a critical ensemble of proteins that is defective in people with this disease.   Our recent findings indicate that this component, biglycan is important for signaling at both the neuromuscular junction and at the dystrophin complex.  We are currently testing the efficacy of biglycan in mouse models of Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy.  Our results have been very encouraging and we are now working to bring biglycan therapy into the clinic.Learning and Memory:  <br /><br />The Fragile X system: Mental retardation and Autism<br /><br />In the second area we study how experience shapes neural circuitry.  This process is fundamental to learning, memory and forging effective communication between self and the outside world.  Our focus is on Fragile X syndrome, which is both the most prevalent inherited mental retardation and the most common single gene cause of autism (or Autism Spectrum Disorders; ASD).  Recent evidence indicates that the behavioral parallels between FXS and autism reflect shared cellular mechanisms: both conditions are disorders of synaptic plasticity.  In both diseases it is likely that there is failure of appropriate sculpting of neural circuitry in response to environment/experience.  We have discovered a novel structure, the Fragile X Granule (FXG) that is expressed presynaptically.  Intriguingly, FXGs are circuit selective and developmentally regulated. The distribution and timing of these granules correlates remarkably well with circuits known to be affected in autism &#150; such as prefrontal cortex, cerbellum and limbic system.  Our working hypothesis is that FXGs are involved in presynaptic plasticity and axonal pruning.  Current projects in the lab include the selective manipulation of presynaptic FMRP/FXGs using Cre-lox methodology in vivo and compartmentalized cultures where we can isolate axonal fractions.  Our goals are: 1) To identify the RNA cargo of FXGs; 2) To determine the protein composition of FXGs; 3) To demonstrate the function of FXGs in synaptic plasticity."

S'Edward V. Famiglietti, M.D., Ph.D.<br />Summary of Research Accomplishments and Research Interests<br /><br />A. Scientific Achievements<br /><br />*  Thirty-five years of research on the retina.<br />*  Discoverer of the bisublaminar organization of ON and OFF pathways in the inner retina.<br />*  Co-discoverer of the organization of rod and cone pathways in mammalian retina.<br />*  Discoverer of starburst (cholinergic) amacrine cells in the retina.<br />*  First or sole author of thirty-two refereed papers on the retina and visual system in Science, Vision Research, Visual Neuroscience, Journal of Neuroscience, Journal of Comparative Neurology and Brain Research, and an author on refereed papers in Investigative Ophthalmology, and other journals.<br />*  Author of more than forty abstracts on retina and visual system.<br />*  Invited guest-speaker at university departments on more than sixty occasions at universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, and M.I.T.<br />*  Invited speaker at seventeen international symposia.<br />*  Organizer of an international symposium on \'retinal ganglion cells: form and function\' at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.<br />*  Co-Organizer of a satellite symposium of the International Physiological Congress on \'retinal development and regeneration\'.<br /><br />B. Research Activity and Research Goals<br /><br />Basic Retinal Neurobiology-Fundamental Aspects of Visual Information Processing in the Retina<br /><br />The first of Dr. Famiglietti\'s studies in retina were directed identifying the cellular components of the retina and understanding organization or \'neural architecture\' of their neural circuits, which underlie the processing of visual information in the retina.  This work, elucidating the ON and OFF pathways of the retina, as well as the specific differences between rod (night vision) and cone (day vision) pathways of mammalian retina, also included the identification by structural criteria of functional types of retinal ganglion cell that transmit information, decoded and processed in the retina, to various higher centers of the visual brain.  In addition, this work focussed on the roles of key retinal processing units, the amacrine cells, identified by neurotransmitters that they use, in particular, amacrine cells containing GABA, the brain\'s most common inhibitory neurotransmitter, and amacrine cells containing acetylcholine, one of the brain\'s most important excitatory neurotransmitters.  These two neurotransmitters play important roles in retinal motion sensitivity and directional selectivity.  Elucidating the neural circuitry underlying these mechanisms was the major focus of the latter half of this period of work.<br />A research effort of longstanding, presently nearing completion, is the morphological classification of retinal ganglion cells in rabbit.  In all, between 42 and 45 (morphological) types of ganglion cell have been identified in rabbit.  The well-studied physiology and pharmacology of rabbit ganglion cells shows the greatest diversity of types among mammals identifiable by visual stimuli.  Hence rabbit ganglion cells are most readily characterized in terms of visual function.  In a comparison of morphological and physiological types, this system offers the greatest promise of understanding the functional diversity of parallel visual pathways in mammalian and ultimately the operation of these pathways in human retina.<br />A structural-functional correlation has been made for seven types of large, rapidly conducting ganglion cells.  We are attempting to understand how these ganglion cells are distributed across the retina, as well as what the requirements are in mammalian vision for such diversity.<br />Subject to finding priorities, a parallel undertaking of ganglion cell identification and functional classification will be initiated in mouse retina, and the rabbit library of types will be used to guide the analysis in mouse.  Mouse retina will afford the opportunity to extend such studies to the level of gene expression.  Fundamental questions can then be addressed concerning the generation of ganglion cell diversity in mammalian retina, and the answers will permit the discrimination of morphological-functional types by their molecular genetic signatures.<br /><br />Retinal Development and Genetics<br /><br />For some years, pilot developmental studies have been underway in Dr. Famiglietti\'s laboratory, exploring the pattern of differentiation of retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells.  More recent developmental studies examining the early expression of the amacrine cell neurotransmitters GABA and acetylcholine showed that these cells and their transmitters are present and play an important, but as yet undefined, role in retinal development just after birth, before the neural circuits that make sight possible are connected.  The importance of understanding these developmental mechanisms is the potential they have for reinnervating a retina that has been damaged by diseases that destroy the retina, such as macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.  Presumably, restoration of the retina by the integration of stems cells or embryonic retinal grafts into retinal layers and circuits, will involve the recapitulation of developmental sequences, built into the genetic programs of the immature, undifferentiated neural cells.<br /><br />Retinal Ganglion Cell Degeneration, Rescue and Regeneration<br /><br />Beginning in l990, a pilot project was initiated in Dr. Famiglietti\'s laboratory to develop an animal model in rabbit of retinal ganglion cell regeneration by nerve grafting after damage to the optic nerve.  Prior work in rat visual system suggested that this paradigm would be feasible, despite the greater difficulties of working with rabbits.  As noted above, a great deal more is known about the ganglion cells of rabbit retina than about those of any other animal. In the adult rabbit retina in vivo, it was found that the large ganglion cells (see above) mounted the earliest and most vigorous response to axonal injury. They were among the earliest to die and among survivors the most likely to form new axons.  The survival characteristics of different types of ganglion cell, after pressure or anoxic insult, could reveal what types of visual functions might be rescued by therapeutic intervention in cases of optic nerve and retinal ganglion cell damage that occurs, for example, in glaucoma, as well as in Alzheimer\'s Disease.<br />One of the principal goals of the development of an in vitro mouse retinal preparation (see below) has been to allow the study of conditions and agents favoring neuronal rescue or leading to neuronal death under controlled conditions and in the presence of known concentrations of agents.<br />A second principal goal of the retinal organ culture preparation is to study the integration of stem cells supplied to replace lost ganglion cells.<br /><br />Growth Factors in Retinal Development and Regeneration<br /><br />Dr. Famiglietti\'s work initiated in Dr. Elaine Bearer\'s laboratory at Brown University, during a period of clinical pathology training, and more extensive studies, subsequently, carried out in Dr. Jeremy Nathans\' laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, at in Dr. Colin Barnstable\'s laboratory at Yale University, have been directed toward methods of tissue culture, and the development of an embryonic (perinatal) mouse retinal organ culture system.<br />Preliminary results of the mouse retinal organ cell culture experiments show that a combination of brain growth factors, including \'brain derived neurotrophic factor\' (BDNF) can aid in the rescue retinal ganglion cells. Other factors, including specific media supplements were important for ganglion cell survival.  The axons of the cells were cut off in removing the retina from the eye, and thus the ganglion cells would otherwise undergo apoptosis and die within three days.  In the mouse organ culture model, under specific culture conditions, ganglion cells survived for the length of the study: more than two weeks.  A subsequent pilot study showed that immature mouse ganglion cells could be isolated by immunopanning and plated upon in vitro mouse retina with the formation of neurite outgrowth suggestive of dendrites.  The focus of new work will be to test whether plated ganglion cells can establish functional connections with presynaptic neurons.<br />Because mouse genetics is so far advanced over that in other mammals, and in view of the availability of many gene "knockout" and overexpression mutants in mice, answers to questions about developmental programs that may be of use in regeneration and restoration of human retinal function will very likely be discovered in mouse models.<br /><br />Growth Factors and the Control of Retinal Angiogenesis<br /><br />Recently, a great deal of excitement has been generated in the world of medical research, particularly in the area of tumor growth, around the subject of angiogenesis and the control of blood vessel proliferation.  In mouse models, antagonists of tumor angiogenesis shrink the tumors.  In retina, abnormal angiogenesis is the critical final common pathway that leads to retinal damage in many eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and vascular changes due to aging.  The cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or vascular permeability factor, has been confirmed as the causative factor in retinal blood vessel proliferation, both normally during development, and abnormally in the vascular proliferation characteristic of major eye diseases.  As Dr. Famiglietti and colleagues in neuropathology and ocular pathology have shown, however, VEGF is present normally in most neurons and glial cells of adult human retina.  Thus, retinal neurons, highly sensitive to ischemia and anoxia, appear well equipped to regulate their own blood supply.  Unfortunately, ischemic insults to retina apparently provoke an overexpression of VEGF and consequent vascular proliferation and growth of abnormal vessels that may eventually disrupt and destroy the retina by several mechanisms.<br />Inhibitors of the action of VEGF on vascular endothelial cells have already proven of value in reducing abnormal angiogenesis in animal models. In cases of human eye disease, after abnormal vessels have already formed, it may be possible to apply agents like those used to eliminate the vessels in tumors to halt the deterioration of the retina.  This strategy, coupled to that developed for neural transplantation and regeneration, may ultimately be successful in restoring the integrity of the retina and adjacent structures, as well as in recovery from stroke and vascular diseases of aging.  If this therapeutic strategy is to be successful, it may be necessary for agents to discriminate reliably between abnormal and normal retinal vessels.  In the likely case that both abnormal and normal vessels will be affected, it will be necessary to invoke neuroprotective mechanisms to safeguard vulnerable brain and retinal neurons.'

S'The encounter with donor white blood cells frequently occurs following the transfusion of blood products with immunological consequences for the recipient that can be both beneficial and detrimental.  One area of research interest has been to study the immune responses induced by the encounter with allogeneic white blood cells and how different treatments of the blood products affect these responses.  Particular emphasis has been placed on how exposure of the blood products to different types of irradiation alters the immune responses that are induced in the recipient following transfusion. <br /><br />Transfusion of donor lymphocytes or stimulated lymphocytes has also been used to achieve anti-tumor responses. The preferred approach to induce anti-tumor responses has been to use antigen loaded dendritic cells.  The limitations of this approach have been that there are very few cells present in the peripheral blood, requiring expansion of the cells which is costly both in facilities and cytokines.  Retrospective analysis has suggested that, if objective reduction of tumor size is used as measure of success, less than 3% of patients have responded in trials using dendritic cells.  Recent published results and results from our laboratory have shown that CD4+ cells are able to act as antigen presenting cells (APC).  The advantage of using CD4+ cells as APC for immunotherapy is that one can often obtain 100 fold more CD4+ cells than dendritic cells from the peripheral blood.  The increased number of cells should permit their use as APC without expansion.  We are currently testing the possibility of using human CD4+ cells as APC and have found that they are capable of inducing alloreactive cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL).  Ongoing studies are also testing if they are able to induce restricted CTL that are used to generate anti-tumor responses.<br /><br />Cytolytic cells generate granules which contain contain serine proteases called granzymes.  These granzymes may contribute to inflammation. Sepsis is the result of systemic dysregulated inflammatory responses that result in the death of 30 &#150; 50% of affected individuals. Recent findings by my collaborator, Dr. Yow-Pin Lim, have shown that decreased levels of a protease inhibitor, inter-a-inhibitor proteins  (IaIp), is associated with increased mortality in septic patients.   Administration of IaIp in animal models of sepsis has been shown to greatly increase survival.  Although administration of IaIp is helpful for the treatment of sepsis, no mechanism for its action has been proposed.  Based on a published result showing that IaIp was the physiological inhibitor of granzyme K, a serine protease found in the granules of cytolytic cells, we hypothesized that the decreased levels of IaIp results in increased levels of uninhibited granzyme K with pathological consequences.  An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure levels of granzyme K in biological fluids and it was found that granzyme K levels are increased in septic patients when they are admitted to the emergency room and significantly decreased in septic patients enrolled in a trial for severe sepsis.  Injection of LPS into na&#239;ve C57BL/6 recipients results in a spike of plasma granzyme K levels at 48 hours.  Because of the similarity of these results it would indicate that granzyme K levels are benchmark reference points for comparing murine responses to inflammatory stimuli with human inflammatory responses.  Future experiments will examine the potential diagnostic usefulness of measuring granzyme K levels for staging sepsis and examining the possible role of granzyme K in inflammation.'

S'I completed my Ph.D. in Genetics from the Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Minnesota under the direction of Dr. David P. Fan.  The subject of my thesis research was the characterization of antigens capable of stimulating murine cytolytic T lymphocytes.  My postdoctoral fellowship was conducted in the Division of Basic Immunology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Seattle, WA under the direction of Drs. Walter Newman and John Hansen.  The focus of this research was phenotypic and functional characterization of human cytolytic lymphocytes. Since then I have been a part of the Division of Hematology and now Hematology/Oncology at Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University.  The research focus has been on studying the regulation of immune responses that occurs in response to the transfer of allogeneic white blood cells that occurs in the setting of transplantation, transfusion and pregnancy with a particular emphasis on studying the role of cytolytic lymphocytes.'

S"Professor Feerick's research resituates the early modern category of race around the central axis of blood and lineage.  If recent criticism has anticipated the modern category of race in readings of Renaissance literature by emphasizing skin color as a dominant marker of difference for the period, Feerick argues that bloodlines -- whether elite or base -- underpinned an earlier symbolics of race.  She reads a series of transatlantic literary texts (epic, drama, prose) as expressive of this longstanding system of identity rooted in blood being pressured and even coming unravelled under the circumstances of English migration and transplantation.  In the context of working through the displacement of English men, women, and children from English soil and culture, the period's literature, she argues, dramatizes the contest between competing ways of organizing the world's peoples and physiologies. A piece of this research has led her to ask what horticultural language of the period can tell us about its premodern racial classifications."

S'My main research interests remain welfare economics, law and economics, and the value of life.<br /><br />Roberto Serrano and I have finished writing <i>Welfare Economics and Social Choice Theory, 2nd Edition</i>, and it was published by Springer at the beginning of 2006.  Major new chapters in the 2nd edition are:  welfare properties of jungle exchange, uncertainty in exchange, life and death choices, implementation in Nash equilibrium, and implementation in Bayseian equilibrium.  Many other chapters have substantial new material, including the following:  expected utility theory, consumers\' surplus and cost-benefit analysis, multidimensional voting theory, and a new and transparent version of Arrow\'s theorem.<br /><br />"The Hand Rule and United States v. Carroll Towing Co. Reconsidered," Working Paper 2002-27, joint with Jeonghyun Kim, was published in the American Law and Economics Review (fall 2005).  This paper examines the U.S. v. Carroll Towing case carefully, and argues that Judge Hand\'s negligence test was different from what is assumed by modern theorists, and in fact would have allowed inefficient game equilibria.<br /><br />Another paper, "Victim or Injurer: Negligence-Based Liability Rules Under Role-Type Uncertainty, With an Extension to Collisions of Different-Sized Vehicles," Working Paper 2003-17, also joint with Jeonghyun Kim, has been revised and resubmitted.  This paper modifes the standard tort liability model by introducing uncertainty about which party would be the victim in an accident, and which would be the injurer.  It also develops a model of motor vehicle accidents, which relates the victim/injurer dichotomy to the vehicle sizes of the two parties.&#9;<br /><br />I am also interested in the abstract utilitarian theory of life/death choices.'

S'I was born in 1943 in Paterson, New Jersey, and grew up in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.  I received an B.S. degree in mathematics in 1965 from the University of Chicago, an M.A. in anthropology in 1967 from the University of Chicago, and a Ph.D. in economics in 1972 from Johns Hopkins University.<br />I married Barbara Moses in 1965, and we are still married. She is also a University of Chicago graduate, and has a long career as a public school teacher. We have three children:  Paula Feldman, born in 1972; Elizabeth Feldman, born in 1973; and Jacob Feldman, born in 1979.<br />In 1971, with my Ph.D. dissertation mostly complete, I started teaching at Brown University.   After 35 years, I am still at Brown.  I have taught thousands of Brown students in hundreds of classes.  I have been director of graduate studies in the economics department, and, for many years, director of undergraduate studies.  I do research in welfare economics, law and economics, and related topics.<br />Since the 1970\'s I have also worked as a consultant and forensic economist.  I have testified as an expert witness in many states on many occasions.  I am one of the best-know "expert economists" in New England, and I have been described by a Rhode Island lawyer as the "Mike Tyson of experts."  (The lawyer meant this as a high compliment!)<br />I have many interests outside of my academic work and my consulting work.  I am interested in woodworking and antiques, and I collect and restore antique clocks.  I am also interested in natural science on the amateur level, including astronomy, wild plants, and birds.  For pleasure I read Scientific American and Darwin, and  I listen to Chopin and Dvorak.'

S"Professor Feldman's research interests include mesoscopics, strongly correlated electrons, and disordered systems.<br /><br />Modern technology allows confining semiconductors on the nanoscale in one or two dimensions. As we now know, the states of matter formed by electrons in such confined systems cannot be described as one- and two-dimensional analogs of electronic matter in three-dimensional semiconductors. The understanding of those novel states and the transitions between them is one of the key problems in condensed matter physics. The fractional quantum Hall effect provides a striking example. In quantum Hall systems electrons split into several pieces which are neither conventional fermions nor bosons and whose charge is a fraction of the electron charge. One of the directions of Professor Feldman's research is an attempt to understand how the fractionally charged particles propagate and what happens at the phase transitions between quantum Hall phases with different fractional charges. A very interesting question concerns quantum Hall systems with filling factor 5/2. They might exhibit non-Abelian statistics and open a road to the practical implementation of quantum computing.<br /><br />Another related direction of Professor Feldman's research program is the physics of quantum wires. As the dimensions of electronic<br />devices scale down, the diameter of wires approaches the electron wavelength. At such scales the intuition based on macroscopic electrodynamics ceases to work and remarkable new physics emerges. Professor Feldman's work focuses on spin and charge transport in non-equilibrium conditions, e. g., in the presence of time-dependent fields. The competition of non-equilibrium effects with strong electron interaction results in very unusual behavior. For example, as professor Feldman has shown, an impurity which backscatters incoming electrons can enhance the current in the forward direction.<br /><br />The third research direction of Professor Feldman's group is disorder effects in condensed matter. Theorists like idealized models of perfectly uniform crystals, but in the real world impurities are inevitably present. Recently Professor Feldman worked in the field of random porous media. Random porous media such as soil are present everywhere. What happens when a porous matrix confines complex liquid? Experiments with liquid crystals have shown that the usual phases such as nematics and smectics are destroyed in the confinement. The common feature of all liquid crystalline states observed in random media is slow dynamics that resembles relaxation in glasses. Professor Feldman was able to obtain a detailed description of the glassy phase formed by nematic liquid crystals. The random-field Ising model and quantum Hall plateau transitions are closely related problems."

S'I have long studied processes of change in organizations, and much of my research has focused on health care organizations.  I am particularly interested in how organizations link/connect to other organizations, and in examining how such linkages influence their performance:  for health care organizations, this translates into an examination of the impact of connections between hospitals, community cancer programs, skilled nursing facilities and other health care organizations on quality of patient care and cost of patient care.<br /><br />I am also interested in change in professional work, professional careers, and in the organizations where professionals do their work.  With Kevin Leicht, I have examined the history and theory of managerial and professional work, and we have described specific contemporary changes in professions and work-settings (see <i>Professional Work: A Sociological Approach</i>, 2001, Blackwell).  Our primary thesis is that managerial prerogatives are expanding, while professionals find their autonomy and sphere of discretion shrinking.  We have also detailed recent demographic changes in the workplaces of professionals, and we revealed an increasingly unified elite division of labor that casts the role of the manager as a "new professonal."  <br /><br />Another research interest is the analysis of racial concentration of patients in nursing homes, and disparities in nursing home quality of care.  Working with Vince Mor (Community Health, CGHCR) and others, we have combined national datasets on nursing home quality of care with data on nursing home segregation and community residential segregation, to determine how and why inequalities in nursing home care develop.  Both access to nursing homes and the quality of care received by elderly patients in nursing homes can be described as "separate" (nursing homes tend to be either well financed and located in resource-rich areas, or poorly equipped and located in poor communities) and "unequal" (poorer homes tend to have lower quality care processes and outcomes). Many factors are thought to contribute to this sorry picture, including patterns of residential segregation, local long term care (LTC) market structure, state level reimbursement policies, nursing home (NH)-level strategic decisions, and patient level characteristics which can influence the sorting of individuals into particular types of nursing homes, depending upon their location in different neighborhoods. <br /><br />I am also working with colleagues at the National Cancer Institute (Dr. Steve Clauser, Dr. Irene Prahbudas) on community-level efforts to increase cancer research efforts (connected to innovations in genomic medicine, IT, etc.) available within local communities as well as to spread the diffusion of state-of-the-art cancer treatment.  I have contributed to efforts to understand the impact of multidisciplinary treatment teams in cancer care delivery, the development of research connections between NCI cancer centers and community cancer programs, and the use of multilevel models and approaches to study cancer care.'

S'I have been exploring the differential effects of normal aging and Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) on sensory integration and attention.  AD produces a unique disconnection syndrome in which corticocortical projections connecting distinct but functionally related cortical regions are systematically disrupted.  A major consequence of this distribution of pathology should be the loss of effective interaction between otherwise relatively intact cortical areas.  One phenomenon that should be particularly sensitive to this disruption is the ability to bind sensory features processed in different cortical regions into a coherent representation, since such sensory integration is thought to be dependent upon coordinated activity across different cortical regions.<br /><br />As an initial test of this hypothesis, we examined the ability of AD patients to integrate visual features processed in separate cortical regions using a global motion coherence task in which subjects are asked to detect the direction of motion for a subset of signal dots moving coherently across a circular aperture while embedded within a larger number of randomly moving noise dots.  Previous studies in normal subjects have found that the ability to detect this motion can be enhanced either by segmenting the signal and noise on the basis of luminance contrast (i.e., black vs. white) or by segmenting the signal on the basis of isoluminant chromatic structure (i.e., red vs. green):  While the enhancement from luminance segmentation reflects the integration of motion and luminance information solely within the dorsal visual stream, the enhancement from color segmentation must reflect integration of motion and color information across the dorsal and ventral streams, respectively.  We found that patients with AD were able to effectively use the luminance cues to bind two visual features processed within the same cortical stream, but were unable to use the color cues to bind two visual features processed in separate cortical streams.  In contrast, neurologically intact individuals and patients with a subcortical neurodegenerative disease (i.e., Huntington\'s disease) were able to effectively bind sensory information both within and across the cortical streams.  This cross-cortical binding deficit not only provides psychophysical confirmation of the neocortical disconnectivity in AD, but also suggests that this disorder can serve as an excellent "model system" for delineating the cognitive and neural substrates mediating sensory integration in humans.<br /><br />This novel finding has led to the development of several other sensory integration projects.  First, since tests of sensory integration may provide direct neurocognitive probes of the functional disconnectivity that is pathognomonic to AD, we are currently examining the feasibility and utility of sensory integration as a novel marker for early detection and tracking the progression of AD.  In particular, we are assessing the ability of normal elderly subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients to integrate sensory information at three different levels of cortical information processing: (1) Unimodal integration of visual featural information; (2) Cross-modal integration of lower-level visual and auditory information; and (3) Cross-modal integration of higher-level visual and auditory information.  Second, we have recently begun to employ both electrophysiological event-related potential (ERP) measures and functional imaging (fMRI) techniques to investigate whether normal elderly participants and patients with MCI or AD show similar patterns of activation across the different brain regions while performing these sensory integration tasks.  The use of ERP and fMRI in conjunction with the behavioral assessment of sensory integration has great potential for identifying patients in the earliest prodromal phase of AD.  The development of such a marker would have substantial implications for more effective application of pharmacologic and neuroprotective therapies for AD, as well as for longitudinal tracking of the efficacy of these treatments throughout the course of the disease.<br /><br />Another line of research is concerned with understanding the effects of normal aging and Alzheimer\'s disease on different attentional systems.  In an initial study, we examined the interaction of phasic alerting and spatial orienting in AD patients using a spatial pre-cuing task in which a cue indicating the probable location of the target is presented just prior to the presentation of that target.  The difference between response speeds to invalidly cued and validly cued targets, referred to as the orienting effect, reflects how efficiently observers engage, move, and disengage attention from one location to another.  While some studies have found an increased orienting effect in AD patients similar to that observed in patients with parietal lobe damage, several other studies have found AD patients to demonstrate normal or even anomalous orienting effects.  One explanation for these discrepant results that has not previously been considered is that the performance of AD patients on spatial pre-cuing tasks does not solely reflect changes in spatial orienting processes in these patients, but rather reflects the interaction between changes in orienting and phasic alerting.  Phasic alerting refers to non-selective, stimulus-driven processes that enhance performance on sensory processing tasks and that are elicited within the orienting task whenever a cue is presented prior to the target.  Although not typically examined within spatial pre-cuing paradigms, phasic alerting can be assessed by directly comparing response times for neutrally cued targets with those for targets not preceded by any cue.<br /><br />We found a marked deficit of phasic alerting in AD patients suggestive of a disruption within the ascending noradrenergic projection system previously implicated in the modulation of phasic arousal.  Although AD patients also demonstrated an increased orienting effect in our task, this effect was due to an apparent increase in the benefit of validly cued targets associated with a decrease in the non-selective alerting benefit provided by these cues rather than to an actual change in orienting per se.  These results suggest that performance within the spatial pre-cuing task reflects an interaction between non-selective phasic alerting processes and spatially selective orienting processes.  These findings not only serve to increase our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in AD patients, but also suggest that the simultaneous assessment of alerting and orienting processes within the same task may be a particularly powerful approach for investigating the neural and cognitive architecture of attention in neurologically intact individuals.  To further explore the nature of this interaction, we have recently completed a follow-up study with young normal adults in which we systematically manipulated the level of phasic alerting elicited within this task by presenting non-spatial auditory cues simultaneously with visual cues on half of the trials.  Consistent with our conclusion from our initial study that alerting specifically facilitates sensory processing of targets, we found that increased phasic alerting selectively enhanced performance on validly but not invalidly cued targets.<br /><br />Finally, I have been involved in a series of studies designed to systematically assess the status of different attention systems in AD patients cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally, and to then examine how changes to these attention systems contribute to changes in actual driving ability.  To this end, we have developed a set of computerized cognitive tests that assess a number of distinct aspects of attention (i.e., vigilance, arousal, selective and divided attention, and working memory), and that can be performed both in isolation or embedded within a computerized driving task in order to simulate the high cognitive demands associated with real-world driving.  These studies should not only provide a better understanding of the neurocognitive substrates underlying different attentional processes, but should ultimately lead to more effective diagnostic measures for predicting on-road driving performance.'

S'I was born in Tokyo, Japan. My parents are both professors of linguistics and English. Their specialization does not sound very unusual in the current political climate, but it was quite an accomplishment when they were young. Both of them studied English at the time when the language had been completely wiped out from the school  curriculum during the Second World War. My mother was told that she would  never get married by her relatives because she, a woman, wanted to go to  college.<br /><br />My grandfather, Masashi Ueda, is one of the founders of  the first Japanese orchestra. He gave premier  performances of works by Russian and Soviet composers. His study was full of orchestral scores with signatures of famous Russian and international performers with whom he performed. But he didn\'t grow up in a supportive environment either.  He grew up as an orphan in a remote Hokkaido village where the only musical instrument  he was exposed to was a primitive school organ, the kind that plays by pumping air with two pedals. He had no formal music education in childhood, but  when he came to Tokyo in his teens to study electronics, he could not give up his dream. He studied piano, voice, bassoon, and orchestral conducting. I imagine it wasn\'t easy starting music education late and having  to support himself. I hear he even worked as a pianist on an ocean liner  at some point. Grandfather\'s family suffered a great deal during the Second  World War; music was not considered a patriotic occupation.  Grandfather also failed the physical examination to join the army because  of bad eyesight. The whole family was therefore subject to name-calling  "hikoku-min," being repeatedly called that they were not "genuine" citizens.<br /><br /><br />It is perhaps thanks to this family trait that I became  a rare species in Slavic studies in the American context that is primarily populated by American nationals and native speakers of Slavic languages.  Our family members all like to do things that are different and perhaps unusual. I hope that my existence in the field will help inspire more people of different backgrounds to become interested in Slavic cultures and to enrich the field with their unique contributions and perspectives.<br /><br /><br />At home, because of the non-standard configuration of family members  we speak Czech, English, and Japanese.'

S'Edward Filardo has identified a potential role for the seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor (7TMR), GPR30, in triggering rapid nongenomic effects of estrogen. In particular, his group has linked its expression to specific estrogen binding and activation of plasma membrane-associated enzymes, including adenylyl cyclase and matrix metalloproteinases. These studies have shed light regarding the mechanism by which estrogen promotes EGF-like actions.  Moreover, his findings provide specific support for the hypothesis that estrogen employs receptors other than the known estrogen receptors, ERa and ERb.  This work has particular relevance to breast cancer for two reasons.  First,  adjuvant treatment is largely defined by monitoring ER expression in tumor biopsy specimens collected at diagnosis. Secondly, ER antagonists (tamoxifen and faslodex) function as GPR30 agonists.  Current efforts in his lab are directed towards understanding the mechanism by which GPR30 promotes rapid estrogen action and influences breast tumor cell behavior.'

He came to Brown in 1996 after completing a postdoctoral fellowship at the Scripps Research Institute in which he characterized functional motifs within integrins that promote tumor cell adhesion and metastasis.  His research group has identified and characterized a plasma membrane-associated estrogen receptor, named GPR30, that functions independently from the known estrogen receptors, ERa and ERb. His research group has shown that this novel estrogen receptor triggers rapid estrogen signals, including the release of membrane-tethered EGF ligands from the surface of human breast cancer cells. He was awarded an American Cancer Research Scholarship in 2003.'

It looks at Native American communities in Rhode Island, Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and Long Island (NY), over the long course of the 18th century, particularly with regard to their involvement in the so-called "Great Awakening" of the 1740s. Using a variety of court documents, land deeds, letters, material culture, and church records, he traces the selective adoption of Christian ideas and practices by Native individuals prior to and during the Great Awakening, and the subsequent emergence, post-awakening, of a distinct Indian separatism and partial rejection of Anglo-American religious institutions in response to a growing proto-racism. <br /><br />He is currently working on his next book-length project, which is a broad-ranging history of slavery and the shades of servitude in colonial New England and the Atlantic world among Africans and Native Americans.

S'VA 180 Sec. 5 The Elm Tree Project: Site and Material<br /><br />As a teacher, my most recent work has included <i>The Elm Tree Project</i>, a new Brown University course co-taught with Professor John Dunnigan from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Furniture Design Department. The course presented concepts and practice addressing issues of designing and executing an object for a specific location on the Brown campus. Students were organized in small teams with members representing both institutions. They were asked to identify a specific site on campus and create a design process consistent with the protocol used by practicing architects, sculptors, or designers. Building on concepts explored in previous Elm Tree Project courses, we focused on the elm tree and its the most unique properties &#150; the potential for bending. The interlocking fibrous structure of the wood allows for fairly extreme bends, well beyond the curve potential of most woods. The combination of working with the wood\'s material properties, techniques such as steam bending and lamination technology, combined with the historical precedents seen in boatbuilding made this an unusual and challenging opportunity for our students. The course exceeded our expectations and yielded four very successful projects, three which have been installed in public spaces on the Brown campus. <br /><br />Building on this classroom experience, I had a very active and productive year with my creative work. <i>The Elm Tree Project</i> has given me the opportunity to integrate the material and subject matter of my courses with the production of two important pieces. The first is an exterior piece (for bronze), which uses two large casts from the base of the original tree. The piece is conceived as both a sculpture commemorating the tree as well as serving a seating function for a public space on campus. The second piece is an interior sculpture from one of the large limbs of the tree carved inside and out using techniques demonstrated by one of <i>The Elm Tree Project</i>\'s visiting artists who has developed techniques using wood from the harvested forests of Tasmania. <br /><br />Additionally, I am continuing my ongoing work using digitally recorded and collaged photographic imagery output via ink jet printing techniques. I am finishing work on a large 8 ft X 20 ft multiple panel piece thematically connected to my ongoing exploration of the dialogue between images addressing western principles of "beauty" juxtaposed with imbedded images of inherent violence and ugliness.<br /><br />Recently, my digital photo/print projects have taken a new direction as I\'ve begun to use images collected through medical imaging techniques such as Cardiac Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Pet/CT, and Gamma cameras. I have completed a small group of prints using images from my own cardiac ultrasounds working with Phillips Medical Systems one of the leading producers of medical imaging equipment. This is a new direction for me and coincides with a new course I am co-teaching with Leon Cooper titled <i>Images for Science: Images from Science</i>.'

S"Timothy P. Flanigan's initial research focused on parasitic infections including Schistosoma mansoni and Cryptosporidium parvum.  As effective therapy for HIV became available, Cryptosporidiosis which is a leading cause of diarrheal illness in persons with AIDS has disappeared.  Dr. Flanigan subsequently shifted his research focus to HIV care in underserved communities, particularly substance abusers, women, inner-city communities and incarcerated men and women.  His early work demonstrated the feasibility of linking individuals with HIV in prison and jail to care in the community after release.  The success of this program led to the implementation nationwide of programs of integrated case management that linked HIV-infected persons with medical care upon release.  Importantly, among women with HIV, recidivism rates were reduced with this intervention.<br /><br />Timothy P. Flanigan has since focused on the importance of routine testing for HIV in underserved communities.  Approximately &#188; of the HIV infected individuals in this country are unaware of their condition and are not receiving medical care.  Programs are underway to evaluate routine HIV testing (and in certain cases rapid testing) in jails, universities, TB clinics, and the primary care setting.<br /><br />Timothy P. Flanigan has spearheaded a program of modified directly observed therapy for HIV treatment for individuals who are marginalized and would otherwise not receive the benefit of our new combination HIV treatments. A pilot program for active substance abusers to provide community based treatment strategies is ongoing and has been cited nationally. This work has been presented at the Infectious Disease Society of America, the Conference on New Advances in HIV Therapies  sponsored by the American Federation for AIDS Research, and the National Retroviral Conference, and received funding through an RO1 from the National Institutes of Health. Pilot programs to extend these community based therapies for pregnant women and persons leaving prison have begun."

S'Dr. Flanigan is the Director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Rhode Island and The Miriam Hospitals and Brown Medical School.  <br />He came to Brown Medical School in 1991 to help establish a network of primary care for HIV infected individuals with a particular focus on women, substance abusers and individuals leaving prison.  <br />Dr. Flanigan developed the HIV Core Program at the State Prison to provide care for HIV infected individuals and link them to community based resources upon release.  Over 70% of individuals in Rhode Island who are HIV infected link with primary medical care at The Immunology Center.  <br />Dr. Flanigan is the PI on The Miriam/Brown AIDS Clinical Trials Unit to develop more effective therapies for the treatment of HIV.  He is also associate director of The Miriam/Brown Fogarty Program which trains and mentors overseas investigators in HIV/AIDS.  <br />He was the recipient of a community health leadership award from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for the development of outstanding primary care for underserved HIV infected individuals.  In 2005, he received an honorary doctorate from Salve Regina University for his support of educational opportunities for children of incarcerated parents.'

S"Dr. Fleming's primary research interests focus on the biomechanics of the lower extremity and biomedical instrumentation. Recent projects include the in vivo strain measurements of the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the development of an experimental model to investigate anterior cruciate ligament ligament and graft healing, the progression of osteoarthritis following ACL injury and reconstruction. He currently has funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Football League Charities to evaluate the relationships between ACL injury, ACL reconstruction surgery, and degenerative joint disease. Rupture of the ACL is a common debilitating injury that leads to the onset and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Surgical reconstruction of the ligament is necessary in many patients to restore joint function, and to stop, or possibly delay, the progression of OA that follows ACL injury. Biomechanical factors, such as altered knee displacements and rotations (kinematics) and contact stress are thought to be responsible, but the relationship between kinematics and the progression of OA is unclear. The progression of osteoarthritis following ACL reconstruction is being evaluated in an experimental model. In this study, the mechanical properties of articular cartilage are being assessed and compared between control, sham, ACL-deficient, and ACL-reconstructed knees. Biochemical markers of articular cartilage metabolism and structural changes to the menisci are also being measured and compared. This work is being performed in parallel with a clinical study evaluating the effects of initial graft tension on the articular cartilage following ACL reconstruction in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. Articular cartilage status is being assessed by measuring changes in the joint space width and cartilage volume of the tibiofemoral joint using radiographic and magnetic resonance techniques. Secondary outcomes include the changes that occur in joint kinematics, strength, and patient-oriented outcomes following treatment. These studies were designed to explore the mechanistic relationships between the initial contact conditions, knee kinematics, articular cartilage metabolism, and degenerative joint disease following ACL injury and its treatment."

S"Dr. Fleming joined the Department of Orthopaedics at Brown University in June 2003. He received his doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Vermont in 1996 and then served on the faculty of the Department of Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation at the University of Vermont. His primary research interests focus on the lower extremity and spine with a particular interest in knee and soft tissue biomechanics, and biomedical instrumentation. Recent projects include the in vivo strain measurements of the human anterior cruciate ligament, the development of an experimental model to investigate graft healing and the progression of osteoarthritis following ACL injury and reconstruction, tissue engineering methods to stimulate ligament healing, and the in vivo measurement of the forces and motion of spinal implants. He has received several awards for his research including the ACL Study Group Traveling Fellowship (2010); The Cabaud Research Award (2009) and the O'Donogue Research Award (2005) of the American Orthopaedics Society of Sports Medicine; the Bruce Selya Research Award of Lifespan (2005), GOTS-Beiersdorf Research Award (2000), the American Society of Biomechanics Post-doctoral Young Scientist Award (1999), the Albert Trillat Young Investigator Award (1997), and the Kappa Delta Award of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (1994)."

She has put together a plant-based olive oil diet that is moderate in fat with the fat primarily from extra virgin olive oil. The plant foods are ones that the literture suggests will decrease risk factors for chronic diseases. She is also interested in the ability of the diet to provide long-term weight management compared to lower fat recommended diets. She is currently testing the diet in women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after the age of 50.'

S'His research is centered in four distinct areas: (1) Greek historiography, (2) the history of the Athenian empire, (3) Sophocles, and (4) the Roman history of Ammianus Marcellinus. For present purposes, he divides his description of his current research into two categories: I. Work which he is now writing up, and which he will have completed within the next four or five months, if not before; II. Work in which his research progresses, but the final product is a degree more distant.<br /><br />I.(1). He returns to the question of the compositional \'unity\' of Herodotus\' history (see his publication on Herodotus, "An Interpretative Essay," 1971) by presenting new or rather unconsidered evidence of a fundamental inconsistency of historical perspective within the work, which can best be explained, indeed, can only be explained, by the hypothesis that some sections of his history were written well before he attained his final conception of world history. The presence of such \'levels\' in the completed work permits us to mark some of the stages of his intellectual development as he compiled his history.<br /><br />With a gifted graduate student, he is writing a paper about one of the fragments of the great Atthidographic historian, Philochorus (FGrHist 328 F 181), which Felix Jacoby seems to have erroneously identified as a quotation in Harpocration, which was (he inferred) taken from Philochorus\' <i>Atthis</i>. They argue against these propositions.<br /><br />He is writing two reviews (one for <i>Classical Review</i>, the other for <i>Exemplaria Classica</i>). The first is on a commentary by Lionel Scott on Herodotus Book 6, which entails discussion (though in limited space) of Herodotus\' sources and his personal inclinations as indicated in his treatment of the Ionian Revolt and subsequent battle of Marathon. The other review is concerned with a text, translation, and commentary on Ktesias of Knidos, by Dominique Lenfant (Bud&#233; 2004). Lenfant\'s work is a major contribution and deserves a thorough analysis. <br /><br />I.(2). The Kallias Decrees (IG. I 3rd ed. 52) are central to modern reconstructions of Athenian financial history. He gave a paper on this subject in Athens in July 2006, returning to this problem after having dealt with it almost 30 years ago (see full publications list). These two financial decrees stand back-to-back on one stone, and the date and purpose of one of them (Face A) has been the subject of immense debate. Normally though not invariably dated to the year 434/3 B.C., he will again propose a later date. <br /><br />I.(3). See below.<br /><br />I.(4). His continuous interest in Ammianus Marcellinus takes different forms at different times. Just now he is finishing a paper presenting certain emendations in the text of 17.1.10, 17.3.5, which, though not of any special historical significance, improve the language and coherence of these passages.<br /><br />II.(1). He is gradually revising and collecting together portions of a (not altogether completed) commentary he had written on Manethon, the Egyptian historian. This was intended to comprise the second fascicule of his continuation of Jacoby\'s great commentary on the fragments of the Greek historians (see full publications list for the first fascicule). Chapters will deal with, among other things,  the vita Manethonis, the apocryphal works, the textual tradition as it reached Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius, and an exhaustive treatment of some of the more difficult fragments.<br /><br />II.(3) For some years he has been planning a monograph on Sophocles. Because Sophocles is an enigmatic playwright, unlike Aeschylus and Euripides, who, in their different ways reveal their fundamental beliefs and message, the (irresistible) temptation to \'explain\' Sophocles and extract higher meaning from his plays has, he thinks, been shown to be counterproductive by the very multiplicity of competing interpretations occurring in modern literature. Sophocles, he believes, was a traditionalist who kept to himself his private and perhaps more exalted notions of divinity and the world, and he secluded these notions from his dramaturgy. Though he accepted, for the sake of the play, the conventional mythical ingredients, he had no interest in either refining them or supporting them. His way was to develop the conflicts and relationships developing there from.<br /><br />II.(4). Certain incidents in Ammianus seem to him to deserve more extensive treatment than they have heretofore received. One that he is currently investigating involves his treatment of Julian before the Battle of Strasburg. As is well known, Julian initially attempted to persuade his army to delay the battle (16.12.9ff.), and his rather puzzling decision to interfere in this manner (he was only the titular leader of the army) is of singular interest. Giovanni Pighi, in his <i>Nuovi Studi Ammiani</i>, last studied the whole question in detail in 1936, and greatly as he admires the work of this fine scholar, he does not think his account (which remains more or less authoritative) is satisfactory. He is reexamining the whole tradition about this affair.'

After a stint at the Ohio State University (1961-3), he had the good fortune to come to Brown as an Assistant Professor, and is currently David Benedict Professor of Greek. He became a Fellow of the Humanities Research Centre at the Australian National University in spring, 1983, and in 1988 he won a Samuel Guggenheim Fellowship.<br /><br /><br />In 1971 his dissertation on The Athenian Board of Ten Generals was published by Historia as an <i>Einzelschrift</i>, and in the same year there appeared his <i>Herodotus, An Interpretative Essay</i> (Oxford). A little later came his <i>Archaic Times to the Peloponessian War</i> (2nd ed. Cambridge 1983), mostly translations of historical inscriptions, with brief explanatory notes. In 1983 there appeared his book on <i>The Nature of History in Greece and Rome</i> (Berkeley) and in the same year, <i>Athens from Cleisthenes to Pericles</i> (Berkeley), in collaboration with Loren Samons. In 1994, in continuation of Felix Jacoby's great work on the Fragments of the Greek Historians, he published <i>Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker IIIc, Geschichte von St&#228;dten und V&#246;lkern (Horographie und Ethnographie), Fascicle I, Commentary on Nos. 608a-608</i> (Leiden). This fasicule contained his commentary on the remaining fragments of the Egyptian ethnographies of Hellanicus of Lesbos and Aristagoras, an Ionian whose ethnikon is unknown.<br /><br /><br />He has written some thirty papers in learned journals or as chapters in books mostly involving Greek historiography, Greek history, various epigraphical questions, though also a few studies on the Latin historian Ammianus Marcellinus, who flourished in the last half of the fourth century A.D. In the past few years, his attention has focused on Greek poetic literature, principally Sophocles and Pindar, though he continues at the same time his research in the above-mentioned subjects.<br /><br /><br />Though his two airedales, Eloise and Alexander, would be perplexed to hear him say it, he lives alone, in the country in southern Rhode Island. For diversion he reads a good deal, mostly 18th and 19th century English literature, and when not reading, he listens to classical music, again mostly 18th or 19th century, or works outside on one landscaping task or another. When his son, Charlie, visits him, as he often does, they play a lot of chess."

S"Andrew Foster is a professor of the Department of Economics, a professor of Health Services Policy and Practice and a research investigator in the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University.  He came to Brown from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. He is a specialist in empirical microeconomics and has worked in a variety of population-related fields of economics, including health, development,  environment, public, and labor. <br /><br />Perhaps the most prominent new element of Foster's research portfolio in the last five years has been in the area of population and the environment in India. He has three major projects in this area: <br />(1) Foster and his collaborator, M.R. Rosenzweig of Harvard's Kennedy School, published a paper in 2003 examining possible mechanisms for a reversal in forest cover declines in India during the 1980s and early 1990s.  The paper makes use of a 30-year panel representative sample of rural India, which they in part designed and implemented as part of a 10-year funded (NIH HD30907, NSF  SBR93-08405, World Bank ) project examining economic growth in rural India; it also integrates remote sensing data on vegetative cover. The paper argues that, in the context of a relatively closed economy like that in India at the time, higher population growth and agricultural productivity may result in increased forest cover in order to meet increased demand for paper and wood products.  More recent research has focused on whether these effects are stronger or weaker in areas with commonly owned forest lands. <br />(2) Foster and Rosenzweig have recently begun a project on groundwater management in India. While groundwater has played a critical role in increasing irrigated area and thus the adoption of high-yielding variety seeds in rural India, there is substantial concern about whether these advances can be sustained in the face of pumping-induced declines in the water table in certain regions. In a recent working paper, they integrate a simple geological relationship known as Darcy's Law into an economic model of water extraction and use this model to structure an analysis of a data on tubewell construction and depth. The results indicate the presence of a significant trade-off between equity and environmental sustainability that arises from the common-pool nature of groundwater resources.  <br />(3) In a recently funded (NIH) project, Foster is collaborating with Naresh Kumar, who recently accepted a tenure-track position at the University of Iowa after serving as an assistant professor (research) in the PSTC, on a project examining the health and distributional consequences of recent court-induced policy interventions that have had a marked impact on air quality in Delhi, India. Preliminary results from the initial of two planned rounds of a survey in Delhi indicate that accounting for changing residential and commuting patterns can have a marked effect on one's assessment of the impact of these interventions. The initial round of the survey was financed in large part using a seed grant from the PSTC.<br /><br />In addition to his work on population and environment, Foster has continued to examine issues in care of the aging in both developed and developing countries. He recently received funding (NIH) for a joint project with Vince Mor and Orna Intrator at Brown's Center for Gerentology to examine the effects of state-based employment mandates on turnover, worker quality, and &#150; ultimately &#150; patient outcomes in U.S. nursing homes. This work builds importantly on previous work Foster has done on imperfect information in labor markets, and it integrates a general-equilibrium search model.  A key contribution of this work is the recognition of the importance of distinguishing between the direct effects of turnover on patient outcomes and the indirect effects that arise because higher turnover affects average worker quality. <br /><br />Other recent areas of interest for Foster include: the effects of intra-family contact on altruistic behavior; the consequences for child human capital of marital sorting; a study of the role of non-farm growth in determining inter- and intra-village inequality in India; a study of the consequences of the effects of family-limitation rules in China (joint with sociologist Susan Short );  examinations, in his role as a graduate advisor, of lowest-low fertility in Europe; of immigrant inter-marriage in the United States; of marriage-migration interactions; and of moral hazard arising in intra-family transfers."

S'Transcriptional regulation is achieved by the coordinated interplay of numerous protein factors with regulatory control sequences coded in the genome. At present, many of the major components of the machinery regulating transcription in eukaryotes are well known. However, mechanisms by which this complex machinery achieves precise control of cell and tissue-specific programs of gene expression observed in multi-cellular organisms is poorly understood. Our laboratory is interested in deciphering mechanisms of gene expression patterns critical for proper organ development and function in mammals. Using the mouse as a rich genetic and developmental system, we plan to probe the biological function of various components of the transcriptional apparatus to uncover novel pathways of cell type specification. In addition to characterizing basic mechanisms of differentiation and development, we will utilize developmental defects in the mouse to model human disease states as potential avenues of therapeutic intervention.  Research in the laboratory will focus on two related areas--roles of a specialized TFIID complex in reproduction and development and in the etiology of human disease states.  The multi-protein complex TFIID is a general transcription factor at the core of the RNA polymerase II machinery. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and several TBP-associated factors (TAFs). To test the hypothesis that TFIID functions in regulating tissue-specific programs of gene expression, we have characterized the biological role of a gonadal-enriched subunit of TFIID called TAF4b (formerly called TAFII105).  Strikingly, female mice lacking TAF4b are infertile due to developmental defects in the ovary that prohibits proper oocyte growth and development.  In addition, male TAF4b-deficient mice can undergo normal spermatogenic differentiation but fail to maintain spermatogenesis in adulthood.  Based on these initial findings, we plan to characterize the normal expression patterns and functions of TAF4b in reproduction and gonadal development.  Furthermore, we will characterize underlying molecular mechanisms controlling gonadal gene expression networks in the mouse.  In combination with elucidating the normal developmental functions and mechanisms of TAF4b in reproduction, we will probe the function of TAF4b in humans as a potential cause of premature reproductive failure or infertility.  Our recent work has unveiled an important function of TAF4b in the control of cellular proliferation in the ovary, and we will extend these studies to identify the potential deregulation of TAF4b-dependent processes in the context of ovarian cancer.<br /><br />In addition to using the TAF4b-deficient mice as an inroad to studying reproductive development and disease, our laboratory will study functional roles of the chromatin modifying and remodeling machinery in mouse development and human disease. Histone modifications known to be important for the control of gene expression are phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. In addition, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are critical for executing regulated gene- and tissue-specific programs of gene expression. Using the mouse as a model system, we will identify and characterize the function of selective components of the cellular machinery that modify and remodel chromatin in a tissue-specific manner. Such tissue-specific modifiers of chromatin will be targeted for disruption in the mouse and associated phenotypes, and gene expression pathways will be dissected. These studies are aimed at understanding basic mechanisms of tissue-specific gene expression pathways as well as how such pathways go awry in human diseases.'

S'Richard Freiman is molecular geneticist studying fundamental mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in mammalian development and human disease.  Before joining the Brown faculty in 2003, Dr. Freiman completed graduate training in mechanisms garnering eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.  He received his Ph.D. in Genetics from SUNY Stony Brook in 1997.  His thesis research, conducted at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, involved elucidation of critical host cell-viral interactions regulating viral and cellular gene expression programs.  In 1998, he moved to UC Berkeley where he conducted postdoctoral studies on mechanisms of tissue-specific gene expression.  This work led to the discovery that components of general transcription factor complexes play direct and selective roles in mammalian development.  He continues this research at Brown, using gene targeting in the mouse as the primary tool to characterize transcriptional regulators in mammalian development and human disease.  He teaches courses on developmental biology, chromatin and transcription and sex determination.'

S"Freund's derivation of the equations describing the propagation of cracks in an elastic body has led to the understanding of dynamic fracture that is now widely used in such critically important applications as the safety of gas pile lines and the safety of nuclear containment vessels.  Professor Freund's research is concerned with mechanical phenomena in solid materials, focusing on the relationship between the overall mechanical state of a deformable solid and the localized physical processes of material deformation and failure. Work on fracture in cases when material inertia effects are significant has led to descriptions of the processes of dynamic crack growth in elastic and elastic-plastic engineering materials, dynamic faulting in the earth's crust, fragmentation of ceramics and other brittle materials under impact loading, and dynamic failure in ductile materials.  As a current focus, Professor Freund and his students have been concerned with mechanical phenomena involved in fabrication, reliability, and performance of solid-state electronic devices. Among the issues under study are: stress-driven surface diffusion and evolution of microstructure during vapor deposition of semiconductor materials, dislocation formation and growth in strained semiconductors, mechanics of self-assembly of quantum structures, influence of strain on quantum mechanical charge transport in heterostructures, and compliant substrate strategies for fabrication of mechanically stable strained semiconductor structures.  Professor Freund was awarded the 2000 William Prager Medal by the Society of Engineering Science. He is the author or co-author of over 175 articles on stress waves in solids, fracture mechanics, seismology, computational mechanics, dislocation theory, mechanics of thin films, and applied physics, and the author of a Cambridge University Press monograph on Dynamic Fracture Mechanics.  Currently, Professor Freund serves as Editor of the Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids and as Treasurer of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

S'Our research team is studying the relationship between psychosocial factors and childhood asthma. Of particular interest is symptom perception, the process of recognizing and assessing changes in one\'s respiratory function.  Children who can accurately judge the degree of airway compromise miss less school, have fewer emergency room (ER) visits, and have their asthma in better control.  Various psychological characteristics (intelligence, patterns of attention) predict those who are better or worse at this ability.  A project to improve symptom perception ability is under development.  <br /><br />Another thrust of our research is to understand why minorities (in our case, Latinos) have more and worse asthma.  In conjunction with the University of Puerto Rico, we are studying 900 Latino and Caucasian families who participate in a four month protocol that assesses 1) diagnostic issues; 2) health care system differences that impact asthma; 3) family asthma-management patterns, including adherence to asthma treatment regimens; and 4) culturally based differences in symptom perception and expression. Data collection is in full swing.<br /><br />Other team members are focusing on rather diverse questions, ranging from "How does stress affect pro-inflammatory cytokines in childhood asthma?" to "Can adherence to preventive medications be improved?" to "What models best explain the role of stress in minority asthma populations".'

S'After graduating from Brown with a degree in American Lit, I got my MD at Tufts Medical School.  Since I was going into psychiatry, I did a rotating internship emphasizing surgery, mostly at Boston City Hospital, after which I moved to California for residency.  I did two years of adult psychiatry residency at the San Mateo County Community Mental Health Center, two years of child psychiatry residency at Stanford and a year of research fellowship (also at Stanford) prior to joining the Stanford faculty in 1977.  There I directed the consultation-liaison service in the Childrens Hospital and was involved in pediatric oncology research until moving to the Brown Medical School/ Rhode Island Hospital in 1985. At Brown, I have held a number of clinical and administrative positions and have pursued a variety of clinical research projects in pediatric psychiatry or psychosomatic medicine.

S'For further details of our research please see http://particleastro.brown.edu<br /><br />A wealth of observations, dating back 70 years [1], show that the universe is composed of >96% invisible matter and energy [see 2, and refs. therein]. The nature of these missing components is one of the most fundamental questions in physics, and has attracted broad attention from the public. The leading candidate for the invisible "dark matter" is subatomic particles left over from the big bang known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Such particles are also predicted by supersymmetry, a favored class of new particle models [3]. If WIMPs exist, they are also the dominant mass in our own Milky Way, and, though they only very rarely interact with conventional matter, should nonetheless be detectable by sufficiently sensitive detectors on Earth. The primary challenge in detecting them is reducing natural radioactivity. If no effort is made to reduce this background radioactivity, it would mask the dark matter signal by some 10 or more, orders of magnitude. The primary techniques for reducing this radioactive background are placing detectors in a suitable deep underground location, of which there are only a handful worldwide, and using a sophisticated shield against ambient radioactivity from the rock and cavern infrastructure.<br /><br />Gaitskell\'s group is actively involved in the development and operation of detectors that are capable of detecting dark matter particle interactions. The current main focus is on a detector based around liquid xenon (LXe). When a particle interaction occurs in LXe both scintillation light and ionization (electron-ion) signals are created. These signals can be detected using arrays of photomultipliers (PMTs). The LUX experiment, which recently began construction at the Sanford Underground Laboratory, South Dakota, has a 1/3 tonne LXe target observed by some 120 PMTs. <br /><br />The research group continues to work on alternative photodetection techniques to replace PMTs, in order to provide better quantum efficiency for the light detection, and lower intrinsic radioactivity.<br /><br />Gaitskell has had extensive experience of dark matter deployment and operation at underground labs being a PI on the CDMS II (Soudan, MN), which he is now winding down his involvement on, the XENON1- (Gran Sasso, Italy) experiments, which is over, and the LUX Experiment. He has also constructed and operated a low background gamma screening facility (SOLO) at the Soudan Mine.<br /><br />References<br /><br />[1] F. Zwicky, Helv. Phys.

S'* Conditional Economic Incentives for Treatment and Prevention of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections<br />My current research focuses on three main areas of applied health economics and health services research.  First, funded by the NIH (Fogarty International Center and NICHD), I am analyzing conditional economic incentives for HIV prevention among populations at high risk in Mexico City.  I would like to continue exploring the potential effectiveness of economic incentives to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in Mexico, and, if results are encouraging, in other countries with concentrated epidemics as well.  Prevention efforts for populations at high-risk have not sufficiently reduced the incidence of HIV.  The idea of economic incentives to reduce risk and vulnerability in men who have sex with men, and male sex workers, has not been addressed through experimental approaches.  <br /><br />* Estimating Treatment Effects for Economic and Social Programs<br />Second, I am studying the impact of poverty-reduction programs such as OPORTUNIDADES on risk behaviors (smoking, drinking and unprotected sex) in urban and rural Mexican youth.  I would like to continue applying econometric tools to analyze how adolescents make decisions and how behavioral economics can help understand risk behaviors both in the US and at the global level.   Unwanted teen pregnancies, smoking, drinking, drug use and youth suicides continue to be problems in the developed and in the developing world.  The general analytical framework of behavioral economics will allow us to better understand how these behaviors take place and what may be the best set of incentives to reduce them. <br /><br />Similarly, I am investigating the effects of health systems\' reform (Seguro Popular or "Popular Health Insurance") on various outcomes including obstetric care, diabetes treatment and control, and catastrophic & out-of-pocket health expenditures.  Health systems reform is an important topic of research in Mexico and other countries because of the need to expand treatment and prevention services, improve quality, and contain costs.  I would like to continue exploring both experimental and non-experimental approaches to evaluating health reform, particularly health financing initiatives.  <br /><br />* Economic Efficiency and Financing of HIV Programs<br />A third area of research is my work on costs and cost-effectiveness analysis using literature reviews and large datasets for modeling and quantitative evaluation of health interventions as well as projections of future demand and funding for global HIV prevention and treatment programs.  This work has been conducted with financing from several sources including: the World Health Organization; UNAIDS; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis; and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.'

S'Oded Galor\'s most significant contributions to economics have been in the fields of income distribution and economic growth, the transition from stagnation to growth, and human evolution and economic development. He has made other significant contributions to the study of development traps, population economics, technology and wage inequality, and the advancement of the foundations of overlapping-generations models.<br />&#9;<br />I.&#9;Inequality and the Process of Development<br /><br />&#149;&#9;Galor, Oded, and Joseph Zeira. "Income Distribution and Macroeconomics," <i>Review of Economics Studies</i>, 60, 35-52, (January, 1993). (Over 500 citations in the SSCI (ISI) and 2000 citations in Google Scholar)<br /><br />&#149;&#9;Galor, Oded, and Omer Moav. "From Physical to Human Capital Accumulation: Inequality in the Process of Development," <i>Review of Economic Studies</i>, 71, 1101-1026 (October 2004).<br /><br />The traditional viewpoint about the relationship between income distribution and economic growth suggests that income distribution has no significant effect on macroeconomic activities and economic growth.  The observed relationship between inequality and economic growth was interpreted as capturing the effect of the growth process on the distribution of income, rather than the effect of the distribution of income on the growth process.  This viewpoint, as exemplified by the representative agent approach to macroeconomics, dominated the field of macroeconomics and economic growth until late 1980s.<br /><br />This traditional viewpoint had been challenged in the last decade. Theories and subsequently empirical evidence have demonstrated that income distribution has a significant impact on the growth process. The field has attracted dozens of leading researchers in recent years. Hundreds theoretical and empirical papers have been written on the subject, and in 1995 the NBER established a research group on the subject that I have co-directed. <br /><br />This important research field was pioneered by Galor and Zeira (1993).  The Web page of the World Bank states in the description of the literature on inequality and growth: "In the 1990s, the classical view that distribution (one aspect of which is measured by inequality indices) is not only a final outcome, but in fact plays a central role in determining other aspects of economic performance, has come back into fashion. While many economists often start working on a topic at the same time, much of the credit for pioneering this line of enquiry must go to Oded Galor and Joseph Zeira."  <br /><br />Galor and Zeira (1993) argue that income distribution plays an important role in the determination of aggregate economic activity and economic growth. In contrast to the representative agent approach that has dominated the field of macroeconomics for several decades, this study analyzes the role of heterogeneity in the determination of macroeconomic behavior. The research demonstrated that in the presence of capital markets imperfections and local non-convexities in the production of human capital, income distribution affects aggregate output in the long run, as well as in the short-run. The research developed the hypothesis that equality in sufficiently wealthy economies stimulates investment in human capital and in individual specific projects, and enhances economic growth &#150; whereas inequality promotes growth in sufficiently poor economies, a prediction that was confirmed by initial empirical studies.<br /><br />Recently, Galor and Moav developed a unified theory for the dynamic implications of income inequality on the process of development. The proposed theory, developed argues that the replacement of physical capital accumulation by human capital accumulation as a prime engine of economic growth has changed the qualitative impact of inequality on the process of development. In early stages of industrialization, as physical capital accumulation is a prime source of economic growth, inequality enhances the process of development by channeling resources towards individuals whose marginal propensity to save is higher. In later stages of development, however, as the return to human capital increases due to capital-skill complementarity, human capital becomes the prime engine of growth, and equality, in the presence of credit constraints, stimulates investment in human capital and promotes economic growth. As wages increase, however, credit constraints become less binding, differences in the marginal propensity to save decline, and the aggregate effect of income distribution on the growth process becomes, therefore, less significant.<br /><br />The proposed theory provides an intertemporal reconciliation between the conflicting viewpoints about the effect of inequality on economic growth. It suggests that the classical viewpoint, regarding the positive effect of inequality on the process of development, reflects the state of the world in early stages of industrialization, when physical capital accumulation was the prime engine of economic growth. In contrast, the credit market imperfection approach regarding the positive effect of equality on economic growth reflects later stages of development when human capital accumulation becomes a prime engine of economic growth, and credit constraints are largely binding. The unified setting, therefore, generates the insight that, for the currently developed economies, the domination of the credit market imperfection channel is an inevitable by-product of the domination of the classical mechanism in early stages of development.<br /><br />The theory generates a testable implication about the effect of inequality on economic growth, which may provide a greatly needed theoretical guidance in order to resolve the empirical controversy about this relationship. In contrast to the credit markets imperfection approach that suggests that the effect of inequality depends on the country\'s level of income (i.e., inequality is beneficial for poor economies and harmful for rich ones), the current research suggests that the effect of inequality on growth depends on the relative return to physical and human capital. In economies in which the return to physical capital is relatively larger than the return to human capital, inequality is beneficial for economic growth, whereas in economies in which the return to human capital is relatively higher and credit constraints are largely binding, equality is beneficial for economic growth. Hence, although the replacement of physical capital accumulation by human capital accumulation as a prime engine of economic growth in the currently developed economies is instrumental for the understanding of the role of inequality in their process of development, the main insight of the paper is relevant for the currently less developed economies that have evolved differently. In the currently LDCs, the presence of international capital inflow diminishes the role of inequality in stimulating physical capital accumulation. Moreover, the adoption of skilled-biased technologies increases the return to human capital and, thus, given credit constraints, strengthens the positive effect of equality on human capital accumulation and economic growth.<br /><br /><br />II.

Mountford). <i>American Economic Review</i>,  96 (May 2006).<br /><br />This research pioneered the development of Unified Growth Theory - designed to capture the process of growth and development over the entire course of human history.<br />&#9;<br />The evolution of economies during the major portion of human history was marked by Malthusian Stagnation. Technological progress and population growth were miniscule by modern standards and the average growth rate of income per capita in various regions of the world was even slower due to the offsetting effect of population growth on the expansion of resources per capita. In the past two centuries, in contrast, the pace of technological progress increased significantly in association with the process of industrialization. Various regions of the world departed from the Malthusian trap and experienced initially a considerable rise in the growth rates of income per capita and population. Unlike episodes of technological progress in the pre-Industrial Revolution era that failed to generate sustained economic growth, the increasing role of human capital in the production process in the second phase of industrialization ultimately prompted a demographic transition, liberating the gains in productivity from the counterbalancing effects of population growth. The decline in the growth rate of population, and the associated enhancement of technological progress and human capital formation, paved the way for the emergence of the modern state of sustained economic growth.<br /><br />The transition from stagnation to growth and the associated phenomenon of the great divergence have been the subject of intensive research in the growth literature in recent years. The discrepancy between the predictions of exogenous and endogenous growth models, and the process of development over most of human history, induced growth theorists to advance an alternative theory that would capture in a single unified framework the contemporary era of sustained economic growth, the epoch of Malthusian stagnation that had characterized most of the process of development, and the fundamental driving forces of the recent transition between these distinct regimes. The advancement of unified growth theory was fueled by the conviction that the understanding of the contemporary growth process would be limited and distorted unless growth theory was based on micro-foundations that would reflect the qualitative aspects of the growth process in its entirety. In particular, the hurdles faced by less developed economies in reaching a state of sustained economic growth would remain obscured unless the origin of the transition of the currently developed economies into a state of sustained economic growth would be identified, and its implications would be modified to account for the additional economic forces faced by less developed economies in an interdependent world. <br /><br />Unified growth theory suggests that the transition from stagnation to growth is an inevitable outcome of the process of development. The inherent Malthusian interaction between the level of technology and the size and the composition of the population accelerated the pace of technological progress, and ultimately raised the importance of human capital in the production process. The rise in the demand for human capital in the second phase of industrialization, and its impact on the formation of human capital, as well as on the onset of the demographic transition, brought about significant technological advancements, along with a reduction in fertility rates and population growth, enabling economies to convert a larger share of the fruits of factor accumulation and technological progress into growth of income per capita, and paving the way for the emergence of sustained economic growth. Moreover, the theory suggests that differences in the timing of the take-off from stagnation to growth across countries contributed significantly to the Great Divergence and to the emergence of convergence clubs.<br /><br />Variations in the timing of the transition from stagnation to growth, and thus in economic performance across countries (e.g., England\'s earlier industrialization in comparison to China), reflect initial differences in geographical factors and historical accidents and their manifestation in variations in institutional, demographic, and cultural factors, trade patterns, colonial status, and public policy. In particular, once a technologically-driven demand for human capital emerged in the second phase of industrialization, the prevalence of human capital promoting institutions determined the extensiveness of human capital formation, the timing of the demographic transition, and the pace of the transition from stagnation to growth. Thus, unified growth theory provides the natural framework of analysis in which variations in the economic performance across countries and regions could be examined based on the effect of variations in educational, institutional, geographical, and cultural factors on the pace of the transition from stagnation to growth.<br /><br />The establishment of a unified growth theory has been a great intellectual challenge, requiring major methodological innovations in the construction of dynamical systems that could capture the complexity which characterized the evolution of economies from a Malthusian epoch to a state of sustained economic growth. Historical evidence suggests that the transition from the Malthusian epoch to a state of sustained economic growth, rapid as it may appear, was a gradual process and thus could not plausibly be viewed as the outcome of a major exogenous shock that shifted economies from the basin of attraction of the Malthusian epoch into the basin of attraction of the Modern Growth Regime. The simplest methodology for the generation of this phase transition &#150; a major shock in an environment characterized by multiple locally stable equilibria &#150; was, therefore, not applicable for the generation of the observed transition from stagnation to growth.<br />&#9;<br />An alternative methodology for the observed phase transition was rather difficult to establish since a unified growth theory in which economies take-off gradually but swiftly from an epoch of a stable Malthusian stagnation would necessitate a gradual escape from an absorbing (stable) equilibrium &#150; a contradiction to the essence of a stable equilibrium. Ultimately, however, it has become apparent that the observed rapid, continuous, phase transition would be captured by a single dynamical system, if the set of steady-state equilibria and their stability would be altered qualitatively in the process of development. As proposed in unified growth theory, first advanced by Galor and Weil (2000), during the Malthusian epoch the dynamical system would have to be characterized by a stable Malthusian equilibrium, but ultimately, due to the evolution of latent state variables, the dynamical system would change qualitatively, the Malthusian equilibrium would vanish endogenously, leaving the arena to the gravitational forces of the emerging Modern Growth Regime, and permitting the economy to take-off and to converge to a modern growth steady-state equilibrium.<br /><br /><br />III.&#9;Evolution and Growth<br /><br />&#149;&#9;Galor, Oded, and Omer Moav.

It advances a unified evolutionary growth theory that, based on historical evidence, generates innovative hypotheses about the origin of modern economic growth and the observed intricate evolution of health, life expectancy, human capital, and population growth since the Neolithic revolution.<br />&#9;<br />Galor and Moav advance a novel analytical methodology that is designed to capture the complexity of the dynamic interaction between the economic, social, and behavioral aspects of the process of development and evolutionary processes in the human population. The proposed hybrid between Darwinian methodology and the methodology of unified theories of economic growth permits the exploration of the dynamic reciprocal interaction between the evolution of the distribution of genetic traits and the process of economic development. It captures potential non-monotonic evolutionary processes that were triggered by major socioeconomic transitions, and may have played a significant role in the observed time path of health, life expectancy, human capital, and population growth.<br /><br />"Natural Selection and the Origin of Economic Growth" (with Moav), published as the lead article in <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>, develops an evolutionary growth theory concerning the interplay between the evolution of mankind and economic growth since the emergence of the human species. This unified approach captures the intricate evolution of population, technology, and the standard of living throughout human existence. The theory suggests that the struggle for survival that had characterized most of human existence generated an evolutionary advantage to human traits that were complementary to the growth process, triggering the take-off from an epoch of stagnation to sustained economic growth. <br /><br />"Natural Selection and the Evolution of Life Expectancy" (with Moav) develops an evolutionary growth theory that captures the intricate time path of life expectancy in the process of development, shedding new light on the origin of the remarkable rise in life expectancy since the Agricultural Revolution. The theory argues that social, economic and environmental changes which were associated with the transition from hunter-gatherer tribes to sedentary agricultural communities, and ultimately to urban societies, affected the nature of the environmental hazards confronted by the human population, triggering an evolutionary process that had a significant impact on the time path of human longevity. The theory suggests that the deterioration in the health environment in these transitions enhanced the genetic potential for longer life expectancy, thereby providing the genetic infrastructure for the dramatic impact of recent improvements in health infrastructure on the prolongation of human life.'

S"This year has been a very busy year for my research program. I have worked in three main areas: completing my longitudinal study of children of immigrants, developing a new area of research on acculturation in collaboration with Amy Marks, a graduate student in Psychology and continuing collaboration with Professor Anne Fausto-Sterling on early sex differentiation.<br /><br />On the children of Immigrant Study, we have completed about 90% of the data analyses and I have drafts of 6 of the 9 chapters of the book. I am expecting to send the whole book manuscript by the end of the summer of 2006 to the book publisher, Oxford University Press. We have also created a web site that gives information out on the study: (http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Education/research/cgc/) <br />Seeing the culmination of this study, which we started in 1998, is quite exciting but it will also require much of my attention this academic year. <br /><br />In collaboration with graduate student Joe DiMartino, we are collecting five year follow-up data on the 400+ children of the Immigrant Study. This was not included in the original grants that were awarded for the study and it is very exciting to be able to conduct this follow-up. I am grateful for the research funding from the department that is making this possible.<br /><br />The second main research activity consists of work conducted primarily by Amy Marks, under my supervision. Amy has created an experimental paradigm to measure responses to stimuli presented in a computer while the subject's cardiac responses are being monitored. The point of the paradigm is to move the field of measuring acculturation- comfort in a different culture than the one considered your own- to a new level of precision, measuring the actual response, its reaction time and the physiological responsivity that accompanies it. We worked this fall to get all the equipment, the computer program and the space needs taken care of and Amy just collected data on 40 subjects. This will constitute the first study in a series of studies that will eventually constitute her dissertation.<br /><br />The third main research activity is a long term collaboration with Professor Anne Fausto-Sterling. This year we are submitting a manuscript for publication that constitutes the introduction of a new theoretical paradigm for the study of sex differentiation in humans. We have also obtained IRB approval for the analysis of videotapes that were originally collected by Ron Seifer for a study on infant temperament in order for us to be able to code them for the emergence of sex differences. We are in the process of getting this new research project of the ground, including hiring a new research assistant, acquiring the necessary equipment (computer, computer program and interface with video equipment, etc) and setting up the video tape coding protocol.<br /><br />I also completed various other publication projects. One was an invited contribution to an edited book in Spain; the other was the completion of an edited book where I was one of the co-editors. This book is seminal in that it brings together very innovative, recent work on middle childhood, a rather understudied area of human development. I was also invited to contribute to an edited book on bilingualism, which is now in press, and which I am co-authoring with a graduate student at Brandeis who is working on my research program, Flavia Per&#233;a. Finally, we have made research presentations both at national conferences and at other higher education institutions."

S'Dr. Garro\'s research focuses on preventive interventions after an ED visit for children with asthma to improve disease management, and Lyme meningitis.  He recently completed a departmentally-sponsored Junior Faculty Research Development Grant.  This competitive, externally reviewed award provides clinical release time, as well as seed money for a research project. Priority is given to investigators with a strong potential for a career in research.  This grant-funded study involved focus groups with parents of children recently diagnosed with asthma to create a theoretical model of parent satisfaction with the diagnostic process.  <br /><br />Dr. Garro is also a member of the Children\'s Asthma Research Program (CARP), a multi-disciplinary group of researchers at Brown.  Dr. Garro has collaborated in an innovative qualitative study, Adolescent-Parent-Provider Communication in Latinos with Asthma (F32 HL094036-01; B. Jandasek, PI), where his role was to facilitate focus groups that examine communication between teens, parents and physicians.  He has also co-authored two manuscripts, "Integrating Asthma Education and Smoking Cessation for Parents: Estimating Financial Return on Investment" (sponsored by R0162165; B. Borelli, PI), and "Factors Associated with Disparities in ED use among Latino Children with Asthma" (sponsored by U01 HL 72438-01; G. Fritz and G. Canino, PIs).<br /><br />Other asthma publications by Dr. Garro include "Does pre-hospital telephone communication with a clinician result in more appropriate medication administration by parents during childhood asthma exacerbations?" This study used survey data from 204 families to show that parents who communicate with clinicians were more likely to administer &#946;-agonists and oral steroids prior to bringing their child to an ED.  A second manuscript,  "The interplay between pulmonary function and quality of life" reviews outcome measures used to assess asthma interventions.  A third manuscript, "Frequency of Prescription of Inhaled Corticosteroids to Children with Asthma from US Emergency Departments" used data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) to demonstrate that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are under-prescribed by ED clinicians.  <br /><br />Current studies include the "Adaptation of the Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (PACCI) in the Emergency Department".  This project is a collaboration with pulmonologists at Johns Hopkins University, who originally developed the PACCI, which enables clinicians to quickly identify children who have poor asthma control. Our team has validated use of the PACCI in the ED (see Preliminary Data), and has also received financial support from Brown to adapt a Spanish version. <br /><br />Dr. Garro has also published two studies on Lyme meningitis, focusing on decision-making to identify children with undifferentiated aseptic meningitis vs. children with Lyme meningitis.  "Prospective Validation of a Clinical Prediction Model for Lyme Meningitis in Children" validated the clinical prediction rule derived by Avery, et al., and also resulted in the rule of 7\'s (< 7 days of headache, < 70% mononuclear cells, and no cranial nerve 7 palsy) to identify chidren at low risk of Lyme meningitis.  A second manuscript, "Prevalence of Lyme meningitis in children with aseptic meningitis in a Lyme disease-endemic region" established that at least 13% of children in Lyme-endemic regions presenting with undifferentiated aseptic meningitis in the summer and fall actually have Lyme meningitis.'

S"My research is directed at understanding the evolution of the vertebrate locomotor system.  Our lab has focused on the clade Archosauria, a group that includes birds, other dinosaurs, crocodilians, pterosaurs, and additional extinct forms.  We are pursuing two main questions.  First, how has bipedal locomotion, a highly conserved trait, changed over the last 200 million years of theropod (carnivorous dinosaur) evolution?  Second, how was the body plan of a terrestrial theropod transformed to acquire an entirely novel capability&#150;-powered flight?  Both of these questions involve gaining a better understanding of how living birds use their legs, wings, and tail. <br /><br />My students and I integrate data from structural, functional, historical, and computer modeling approaches.  We use techniques such as electromyography, motion analysis (based on x-ray and light video or film), and force plates to interpret the interaction of the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems during locomotion.  Three-dimensional (3-D) computer animation has become increasingly important for our research over the past ten years.  Using animation software (Autodesk's Maya and its predecessor), we create articulated virtual skeletons to quantify complex movement in living archosaurs, reconstruct locomotion in extinct theropods, and explore limb movement from a more theoretical perspective.  Recently we have begun using detailed kinematic data from alligators and pigeons to calculate the balance of forces at the shoulder and how joint loading evolved on the line to birds."

S'Compositional Vision<br /><br />Compositionality refers to the ability of humans to represent entities as hierarchies of reusable parts. The parts themselves are meaningful entities and are reusable in a near-infinite assortment of meaningful combinations. Compositional hierarchies can be fitted with a probability distribution and used as prior models in a Bayesian scene interpretation system.<br /><br /><br />Statistical Analysis of Neurophysiological Data<br /><br />The statistical analysis of neuronal data in awake animals presents unique challenges.  The status of tens of thousands of pre-synaptic neurons, not directly influenced by the experimental paradigm, is largely out of the control of the experimenter. Time-honored assumptions about "repeated" samples are untenable. These observations essentially preclude the gathering of statistical evidence for a lack of precision in the cortical micro circuitry, but do not preclude collecting statistical evidence against any given limitation on precision or repeatability.  Statistical methods are being devised to support the systematic search for fine-temporal structure in stable multi-unit recordings. <br /><br /><br />Statistical Analysis of Rare Events in the Markets<br /><br />When it comes to the prices of stocks and other securities, it seems that rare events are never rare enough. But they are too rare for meaningful statistical study. In order to test financial models of price fluctuations, focused on excursions, the issue of small samples can be side stepped by declaring an event "rare" if it is unusual relative to the interval of observation. Every interval has its own rare events, by fiat, and in fact as many as we need.  Different classes of models have different invariants to the timings of these "rare" events.  These invariants open the door to combinatorial-type hypothesis tests, under which many of the usual models do not hold up very well. The evidence is for very rapidly changing dynamics.<br /><br /><br />Statistical Analysis of Natural Images<br /><br />Take a digital photo of a natural outdoor scene. For simplicity, convert the photo from color to black and white. The photo can be reduced, or scaled, to make a new (smaller) picture, say half the size in both dimensions. In comparison to the original picture, the new picture is of a scene in which each of the original objects, and in fact every imaged point, has been relocated twice as far from the camera. This "stretching" is artificial in that it does not correspond to any movement of the camera in the real world. Yet the picture looks perfectly normal, and the local spatial statistical structure (e.g. the distribution of values of horizontal or vertical derivatives) is largely indistinguishable from the local spatial statistical structure of the original. "Images of natural scenes are scale invariant." The source of scale invariance in natural images is an enduring mystery.<br /><br />Neural Representation and Neural Modeling <br /><br />We can imagine our house or apartment with the furniture rearranged, the walls repainted, and the floors resurfaced or re-covered.  We can rehearse a tennis stroke, review a favorite hike, replay a favorite melody, or recall a celebrated speech "in our mind\'s eye," without moving a limb or receiving a sound.  It is a mistake to model cortical function without acknowledging the cortical capacity for manipulating structured representations and simulating elaborate motor actions and perceptual stimuli.<br /><br />It is tempting to model networks of neurons as networks of integrate-and-fire units, but integration is linear and overwhelming evidence demonstrates the highly nonlinear, and in fact space and time-dependent nature, of dendritic processing.  An argument can be made that these nonlinearities, by their nature, promote a rich and local-correlative structure, as anticipated by Abeles, von der Malsburg and others, within the microcircuits.  These spatio-temporal patterns, with their correlation-induced topologies, would be good candidates for the basic units of cognitive processing.'

S"Tools of molecular biology allow us to analyze the structure, function, and evolution of eukaryotic nucleic acids. Currently, there are two main projects in which we are involved: <br /><br />DNA REPLICATION. Initiation of DNA synthesis is the major check point in the cell cycle: the cell is committed to divide once the genome has been replicated. Are there specific regions and sequences where DNA synthesis will start? To address this question, we are using the DNA puffs of the giant salivary gland chromosomes of the fly Sciara coprophila. DNA puffs represent sites of intrachromosomal gene amplification and are an excellent model for study of DNA replication. We have mapped the origin of amplification by 2-D gels, by a 3-D gel method we developed, and by PCR analysis. The origin contracts from an 8 Kb zone of initiation at pre-amplification to 1 Kb at amplification stage. The left boundary is the same at both stages. The change in position of the right boundary when the origin contracts to 1Kb correlates with the appearance there of RNA polymerase II. We are exploring further the interplay between regulation of replication and transcription. <br /><br />How does DNA amplification override the controls that ensure that an origin fires once and only once per cell cycle? To understand the regulation of initiation, we developed Replication Initiation Point (RIP) mapping to identify the start sites of DNA synthesis at the nucleotide level. We have shown that in yeast and in metazoa (Sciara), the site of initiation of replication is directly adjacent to the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) binding site. Preliminary data suggest that the steroid hormone, ecdysone, induces DNA amplification, providing the first example of hormonal regulation of DNA replication, and may provide a useful paradigm for understanding certain cancers in humans. <br /><br />RIBOSOMAL RNA. Previously, we determined the first sequence of a multicellular eukaryotic 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). We demonstrated that some nucleotide stretches as well as the secondary structure are conserved between the frog Xenopus and the bacterium E. coli, thereby identifying areas of likely functional importance. Our current studies deal with rRNA biogenesis. Specifically, U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) is localized in the nucleolus, and we have shown by injection of antisense oligonucleotides into Xenopus oocytes that it plays a role in rRNA processing, the mechanism of which we are presently studying. We demonstrated that U3 and other box C/D snoRNAs require the box C/D signature motif for nucleolar localization. We have also identified the Nucleolar Localization Elements (NoLEs) for box H/ACA snoRNAs and for spliceosomal snRNAs.<br /><br />Once U3 snoRNA has arrived at its nucleolar destination, it influences the order of cleavages to process pre-rRNA, may act as a chaperone to prevent premature pseudoknot formation in 18S rRNA, and is a molecular bridge to draw together the 5' and 3' ends of 18S rRNA in the precursor. U3 snoRNA docks on pre-rRNA by base-pairing interactions that are species specific, and may allow us to design a new class of antibiotics against eukaryotic pathogens."

S"Susan A. Gerbi is the George Eggleston Professor of Biochemistry at Brown University. She obtained her Ph.D. with Dr. Joseph Gall at Yale University in 1970, where they developed the method of in situ hybridization for localization of genes on chromosomes. After a two year postdoctoral fellowship at the Max Planck Institute in T&#252;bingen, Germany, she joined the faculty at Brown University. She has two major research projects: <br /><br />(1) Initiation of DNA Replication &#150; her lab has devised a method to map the start site of DNA replication at the nucleotide level (Bielinsky and Gerbi, Science 1998). Application of this method to yeast (Bielinsky and Gerbi, Molecular Cell 1999) and higher organisms (Bielinsky et al., Current Biology 2001) revealed that DNA synthesis starts directly next to the binding site for the Origin Recognition Complex of six polypeptides. Her research in progress suggests that a steroid hormone receptor may play a direct role for initiation of DNA replication; this may lead to significant understanding of the role of hormones in certain cancers.<br /><br />(2) Ribosome Structure, Evolution and Biogenesis &#150; studies in the Gerbi lab demonstrated that certain sequences are evolutionarily conserved, even between bacteria and higher organisms, thus pinpointing regions of functional importance in ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Her lab was the first to show that small nucleolar RNA is required for rRNA processing. Their recent investigations (summarized in Gerbi et al., Curr. Opin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003), opens the possibility for a new class of antibiotics targeted against eukaryotic pathogens.<br /><br />Dr. Gerbi has received several honors for her research, including the State of Rhode Island Governor's award for Scientific Excellence and election as President of the American Society for Cell Biology.<br /><br />&#9;Dr. Gerbi is also very active in biomedical Ph.D. training. For over 20 years, she has been the Principal Investigator of the NIH training grant in Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry; this interdisciplinary program involves faculty from 9 departments on the Brown campus and affiliated hospitals.

S'Perceptometrics  <br />The appearance and function of the oro-facial area are major factors contributing to quality of life. The face is essential in verbal and nonverbal communication and also displays important information about an individuals\' gender, age, and race, and personality traits during social interactions (Giddon, 1995; Heller et al., 1998). The physical attractiveness of an individual also affects mental health and social behavior with significant implications for educational and employment opportunities, mate selection, etc. ( Berscheid & Gangestad, 1982; Alley & Hildebrandt, 1988; Buss, 1994; Hatfield & Sprecher, 1995). Individuals with visible stigmata such as cleft lip or port wine stain are subject to negative perceptions and avoidance by others, which can "spread" (MacGregor, 1951; Jourard, 1963; Kapp, 1979; Stricker et al., 1979; Bull & Rumsey, 1988; Houston & Bull, 1994) to other unrelated attributes such as intelligence, honesty, athletic ability etc. Thus, facial perception by self and others influences how others judge us and we judge ourselves.<br /><br />The precise relationship between facial morphology and perception has not been adequately defined. Only by inference from the data acquired by a variety of psychophysical and related techniques can one get an indication of the mental image or ideational representation an individual has of his own or another\'s face or body (Giddon, 1995). It is even more difficult to determine to what components of the face the perceiver is actually responding.<br />Previous studies have used various methods such as drawings, caricatures, touched-up photos, etc. to represent faces (Giddon et al., 1974; Bell et al., 1985; Burcal et al., 1987; Kiyak & Zeitler, 1988; Maxwell & Kiyak, 1991; Assuncao, 1992a & b; Tobiasen & Hiebert, 1993). While providing some information, these stimuli may be unrealistic or nonstandardized, thus, responses to these stimuli may provide some information but may not be reliable or valid. representations of actual faces. Although X-ray cephalometry may be appropriate for assessment of skeletal deformities, it yields limited information on the soft-tissue profile and does not provide a meaningful stimulus for quantitating perceptual responses of patients. <br />Technological advances, such as computer imaging/software, have been used to facilitate patient clinician communication improve diagnosis and treatment planning by quantitatively relating morphological changes to perception of facial/body appearance.<br /><br />In response to the need to develop more realistic stimulus presentations (Giddon, 1995) for determining perceptual endpoints, Giddon et al. (1996a) developed a computer animated imaging program to determine how the quantitative changes in morphology of the face relate to perceived acceptability The new PerceptometricTM method of Giddon et al., developed with support of a NIH Grant (Giddon et al., 1996a & b, 1997; Arpino et al. 1998; Anderson et al., 1999a & b; Giddon & Anderson, 1999; Hier et al., 1999; Kitay et al., 1999; Mejia et al., 2000; Thai et al., 2000) is based on the classic psychophysical method of adjustment for determining boundaries of subjective acceptance (Olzak & Thomas, 1986) of continuously changing physical dimensions of the face; for example, manipulation of anterior posterior and vertical position of upper lip, lower lip, mandible, chin, and lower face height. Such a method permits the determination of how much physical change in a particular feature is necessary before an unacceptable feature/body part is found to be acceptable, or, conversely, how much morphometric change in an acceptable feature/face or body component must occur before it is perceived as unacceptable. The same method can be applied to determine the physical basis of other words used to describe appearance such as attractive, beautiful, pretty, ugly, deformed etc. The PerceptometricTM method animates a sequence of discrete image distortions or frames, which are then used to assess profile preferences. This program establishes the boundaries of a zone or range of acceptability of changes in the soft tissue profile of the face, as well as a midpoint of acceptable change. For both the clinician and the patient, this new technology may be helpful in communicating to the patient both aspects of the diagnosis and the treatment plan. This technique may offer "the clinician the advantage of providing a dynamic range rather than a single point of acceptable changes to the patient" (Kitay et al., 1999). <br /><br /><br />Related Pre- and Postdoctoral Research Projects:  <br />Red font indicates postdoctoral student, Green font indicates predoctoral student<br /><br />Computer-animated Comparison of Self-perception With Actual Profiles of Orthodontic and Nonorthodontic Subjects: Denise Kitay, EA BeGole, CA Evans, DB Giddon<br />The objectives of this study were to determine if motivation for adult orthodontic treatment is influenced by self-perception using the PerceptometricTM program for animating facial changes. Orthodontic and nonorthodontic Subjects (Ss) were equally accurate in their ability to identify their own profiles, however, orthodontic Ss had a larger disparity between the most pleasing and at least one feature of their actual profile than did the nonorthodontic Ss.<br />Int J Adult Orthod Orthognath Surg 1999, 14(2):125-134)<br /><br />Comparison of Preferences in Lip Position Using Computer Animated Imaging: Lawrence Hier, CA Evans, EA BeGole, and DB Giddon<br />The objectives of this study were to examine the esthetic preferences of lip position in males and females and to compare them to each other and a common orthodontic standard using a custom computer animation program. Both males and females preferred a lip fullness greater than the Ricketts\' values. The computer animation method appears to be extremely sensitive, as indicated by the judges\' aggregate ability to differentiate less than 1 mm. of change in the soft tissue profile. Angle Orthod 69(3):231 238, 1999.<br /><br /><br />Presurgical Profile Preferences of Patients and Clinicians: Vincent Arpino, DB Giddon, E BeGole, C Evans<br />Although one of the major reasons cited for seeking orthognathic surgery is a desire for improvement in facial esthetics, differences may exist between the presurgical profile preferences of orthognathic surgical patients and clinicians. It was concluded that orthognathic patients have a lower tolerance for facial profile deviation than surgeons or orthodontists, indicating the necessity of greater communication between patients and professionals.

Following mental math atask and baseline measures, distorted and veridical profile images were presented to Ss. Recordings of heart rate (HR), heart rate variabiliy (HRV) , amplitude of blood volume pulse (BVP) and O2 saturation were obtained. Concurrently, Ss indicated their affective state. Consistent with a response hierarchy, each Ss had a specific pattern of physiologic responses to the self images (i.e. decreased HR and increased BVP; increased HR/decreased BVP). The clinical signifance of these findings is that patients do respond physiologically to viewiing heretofore unseen profile images which may also influence subsequent perceptions.

S"Dr. Gil's research is focused on defining the signaling mechanism of the class II cytokine receptor family. During her postdoctoral training, she shown that the IFN-gamma receptor can engage alternative signal transduction pathways in addition to the conventional Stat1-dependent signaling mechanism.  The alternative IFN-signaling pathways have physiologic relevance since they regulate proliferative responses in vitro and antiviral responses in vivo.<br /><br />Studies from Dr. Biron's laboratory have suggested that dynamic modulation of total STAT1 protein is a natural mechanism for shaping downstream subset responses to IFN&#945;/&#946;. The hypothesis tested by Dr. Gil is that early induction of elevated STAT1 promotes access to antiviral target effects whereas later reduction allows signaling through alternative molecules, including STAT4, to promote different responses. The evaluation of type 1 IFN effects for gene expression following infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) shows that IFN-alpha exposure elicits differential responses in CD8 T cells prepared from uninfected, day 5-infected or day 8-infected mice. Moreover STAT1 levels are modulated on CD8 T cells during the infection as are the levels of IFN&#945;-induced STAT4 phosphorylation. Ongoing experiments are defining the roles for STAT1 and STAT4 for these effects."

S'I started my career conducting macro-level research that focused on government tax policies and their impact on the general population.  Later, I became involved with international organizations to create more micro-level field survey tools for data collection.  As a result of my new found interest in micro-level research, I examined household altruistic vs. risk sharing behaviors using longitudinal panel data for my doctoral dissertation in Economics.  At the end of my PhD program, my research interests focused more on Health Economics with a heavy concentration on programming of econometric models for various government agencies. <br /><br />Currently, I provide expertise on the design, implementation, and development of computerized systems for research and government reporting.  Particularly, I am responsible for designing and maintaining a database system for HIV surveillance in Rhode Island.

S'Mary Gluck\'s research brings into critical juxtaposition a number of distinct, yet interrelated, disciplinary areas: the intellectual history of avant-garde art, the social history of urban modernity and bohemia, and the cultural history of the Jewish Question.  These themes were already implicit in her first monograph on Georg Lukacs and His Generation, which focused on the genesis of a uniquely Central European form of modernist culture in pre-World War I Budapest.  Exploring the close interrelationships between avant-garde aesthetics and radical politics in the context of growing anti-Semitism, the book raised a number of broad historical questions that led to subsequent research agendas.  One of these was the general problematics of modernism both as an aesthetic practice and as a cultural experience associated with modern urban life.  This inquiry resulted in a series of articles on different facets of European modernism and eventually in a sustained study of Parisian experimental culture entitled, Popular Bohemia: Modernism and Urban Culture in Nineteenth-Century Paris.  A second, parallel research interest has been the relationship between urban modernity and the "Jewish Question" in fin-de-siecle Hungary, which will soon be published under the title "The Invisible Jewish Budapest."  Future projects include an investigation into Jewish humor and caricatures in late nineteenth-century Budapest and a collaborative exploration of global bohemias in urban cultures in East Asia, Latin America, South Asia and Eastern Europe.'

S"Dr. Robert Goldberg has been actively involved in community-based studies of the natural history and primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and deep venous thrombosis for approximately 2 decades. In collaboration with clinical and epidemiological investigators at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Dr. Goldberg established the Worcester Heart Attack Study in the early 1980's. Through the current period of funding, the investigators are examining nearly 3 decade long trends (1975&#150;2003) in the incidence rates, in&#150;hospital and long&#150;term survival, and therapeutic approaches used in the management of more than 13,000 greater Worcester (MA) residents with acute myocardial infarction admitted to all hospitals in the Worcester metropolitan area. Dr. Goldberg presently serves as the Co-PI on a population-based surveillance project that is examining changing trends in the incidence, hospital, and long-term case-fatality rates of in and outpatients with venous thromboembolism among residents of the Worcester metropolitan area. Dr. Goldberg is also receiving funding support from the NHLBI to develop community-wide surveillance for heart failure in greater Worcester residents. Dr. Goldberg serves as the senior epidemiologist for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events Project. This is a large multinational coronary disease registry examining differences in the management practices, hospital, and post-discharge outcomes of more than 50,000 patients hospitalized in 14 countries with an acute coronary syndrome. Dr. Goldberg has been actively involved for the past 20 years in teaching basic and advanced concepts in epidemiology and study design, as well as in scientific and grant writing, to graduate students in public health, medical students, and post doctoral fellows and junior faculty involved in clinical and public health research.

S'My overall research interest is in mineral and rock physics, with an emphasis on the rheological behavior of Earth and planetary materials.  Extensive experience in geophysics and materials science laboratories has provided me with a very broad theoretical and practical background in the mechanical behavior and testing of minerals, rocks, and other materials in both the ductile and brittle fields.  In the next five years, my goal is to focus on experiments designed to further our understanding of deformation mechanisms in the Earth and other planets.  Experiments will be conducted both at high confining pressure and at ambient pressure, at high temperatures in the case of materials like olivine and at cryogenic temperatures in the case of ice and other cryomaterials.  Experiments will often employ novel methods developed in materials science both for fabricating and testing of materials, such as hot isostatic pressing of powders to fabricate fine-grained samples and nanoindentation testing to explore small-scale deformation processes. One particular focus of my research has been grain size sensitive flow of materials, a mechanism which involves grain boundary sliding (GBS).  This flow behavior is activated at lower stresses than dislocation creep, and therefore can control the rheological behavior of various materials in low-deviatoric-stress natural environments, such as in glaciers and icy planetary interiors, as well as in the interiors of the Earth and other planets. The flow of ice in glaciers, for example, is likely often controlled by GBS acting in concert with dislocation motion; this is an ice creep mechanism I discovered and characterized with David Kohlstedt at the University of Minnesota.   <br /><br />Within the broader scope of mineral and rock physics, there are several specific research topics I am interested in, including:<br /><ul><br /><li>1) the rheological behavior of pure and impure ices relevant to flow of glaciers, ice sheets, and icy satellites of the outer solar system, </li><br /><li>2) the tribological behavior of rocks relevant to earthquake mechanics, and </li><br /><li> 3) low-temperature creep of geologic materials relevant to the frictional properties of rocks and the strength of the lithosphere.</li><br /></ul>'

S'My research is mostly devoted to 20th-century French literature, language, and culture as well as to French Theater (in all centuries). My approach is founded in literary, linguistic and semiotic pragmatics. An anthropological and sociological dimension also complements and often interacts with my analysis of French works, primarily due to my Romanian research. Thus, I have studied dialogical structures in French Theater and novels, Francophone language behavior in New England (specifically dealing with Franco-Americans), and magical Romanian love poetry. I am currently developing a site entitled Romanian Love Charms with help from the Brown Scholarly Technology Group.<br /><br />Rather than presenting a general overview of my research, I have given some excerpts of my yearly accomplishments. They can show the rhythm and focus of my research in a more natural way.<br /><br />1997<br /><br />In 1997, I published <i>Desire Machines: A Romanian Love Charms Database</i>. The volume consists of an introduction followed by the first pragmatic anthology of love charms ever published. Romanian love charms were chosen because of their exuberant lyricism (contrasting, for example, with the advanced disintegration of the French charms). In the introduction, love charms are (a) compared with psychotherapeutical practices and computer programs, (b) defined as elementary desire machines in which hardware (magic objects, magic substances, magic plants, etc.) combines with software (magic formulas, magic physical actions) to serve a strictly defined purpose, (c) viewed as natural examples of what computer specialists call hypertexts, within the larger semiotic perspective of human dialogic creativity and "soft" natural expertise, and (d) discussed as a typical example of female creativity, reflecting a female semantic universe centered around female identity, occupations, values and actions. The structure of the <i>Romanian Love Charm Database</i> is then presented and discussed in detail, together with the methodological implications of devising databases for other types of magical literature, as well as for all intricately articulated texts that resemble charm scenarios (such as theatrical plays, film scripts, technical directions) for the use of new industrial products, medical prescriptions, cooking recipes, official ceremonial protocols, and game rules. The anthology is comprised of 119 charm scenarios (in both Romanian and English translation) that are regrouped according to twelve pragmatic functions. Ten of the charm scenarios are published here for the first time. The volume paves the way for other love charm databases and anthologies. It represents a seminal transdisciplinary work which combines cultural anthropology, semiotics, women studies, computer studies and pragmatics in order to better account for the archaic articulation between love, magic, health, and fate in a female Weltanschauung.<br /><br />In the same year, I published a chapter entitled "Lire les atlas: le lexique de l\'action dans trois atlas du domaine d\'o&#239;l" in the volume <i>Vitalit&#233; des parlers de l\'Ouest et du Canada francophone</i>, edited by Francis Manzano. In it, I distinguish between linguistic atlases whose macrostructure is centered upon action (i.e., atlases of "doing," such as the atlas of Ile de France/Orl&#233;anais, ALIFO) and atlases centered upon reference (i.e., atlases of "being," such as the atlas of Champagne/Brie, ALCB. I also introduce the distinction between polyphonic atlases (pragmatically transparent) in which the dialogue researcher/witness is still available-- a perfect example being the Atlas Linguistique et Ethnographique de la Bretagne Romane, de l\'Anjou et du Maine-- and synthetic atlases (pragmatically opaque) such as ALIFO and ALCB. <br /><br />Three other chapters were also published at this time. One was devoted to the analysis of Carn&#233;\'s film <i>Les visiteurs du soir</i> and its traces in a text by Duras. In it, I develop a methodology that allows one to establish the filmic ethymology of a literary text or, on another plane, to go from the intensity of the character\'s gaze (as shown in the film or in Duras\' narrative) to the intense public reception of Les Visiteurs in occupied France. The second, entitled "Jeux didascaliques et espaces mentaux" appeared in the volume <i>Le Je(u) didascalique</i>, edited by Monique Martinez. In it, I introduce the distinction between dialogic and didascalic games, and establish the didascalic games as games by means of which the playwright opens and closes successively different mental spaces. I also compare didascalic games played by the dramatic author with those of the director (Copeau, for example, rewriting Moli&#232;re\'s didascalies in <i>Les fourberies de Scapin</i>) and with those of the author-and-director (Duras, writing and staging <i>La Musica Deuxi&#232;me</i>). The third chapter, published in the volume <i>Fran&#231;ais du Canada &#151; Fran&#231;ais de France</i> (edited by Marie-Rose Simoni-Aurembou), examines the special case in which speaking French has ceased to be a definitive feature of the Franco-American identity in New England.<br /><br />Also in 1997, I finalized the volume <i>Lucid Revival: The French Theater of the Eighties</i>, which was sent to publishers during the Spring semester 1998 after a translation revision. I also finished the first draft of the volume <i>Ouvertures et cl&#244;tures th&#233;&#226;trales</i> (co-authored) by the end of 1998. In addition, the volume of critical essays <i>Vamile grave</i> (Grave Appraisals) was sent for publication during the Spring semester 1998. <br /><br />In 1997 I was also a keynote speaker at the international colloquium "Le Je(u) didascalique" (Universit&#233; Toulouse Le Mirail, France) and gave two other invited lectures in Bell&#234;me (France), at the international coloquium "Fran&#231;ais du Canada&#151;Fran&#231;ais de France" organized by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and in New York. I also read a paper on genetic criticism and Theater at a Franco-Hispanic Workshop on Editing Manuscripts. <br /><br /><br />2000<br /><br />During this year I published three consistent studies dealing with theatrical and linguistic pragmatics. The first continues the book that I had written on scenic indications in 1994 by exploring the various ways in which directors supplement (at times contradict or reduce) the playwrights\' didascalies, thus becoming co-authors in the open process of text/play production. My other publications discuss the relation between language and identity in connection with marginal communities of French speakers: those of the Franco-Americans in New England and of the vanishing peasants in contemporary  France. I also wrote three articles that represent further explorations in the fields of the history and future of pragmatics. These include an article on sociologist Caillois\' and literary critic Paulhan\'s contribution to the Coll&#232;ge de Sociologie, an article on ethnomusicologist Constantin Brailoiu\'s migration from fieldwork methodology toward a sociology and a pragmatics of popular music all over the world, and an article on approaching virtual texts via genetic criticism.<br /><br />Together with seven smaller articles and one book review (listed in my CV), I also gave three lectures, most notably a invited talk for the Uni&#243;n Latina at the Romance Languages and Linguistic Communities in the United States. I strongly believe that this encounter will have an important impact on the ways in which we adapt our teaching of French language, literature, and culture to the different instructional settings that are characteristic for the US, as well as for the many different student populations in this country.<br /><br />During 2000, I also edited two massive books that focus on important aspects of my native Romanian culture, and, in doing so, paid an existential as well as a cultural debt. Here, I will especially point to the second edited collection (<i>Ultima carte (The Last Book</i>), which is an exhaustive publication of documents that I found in the secret Archives of the Romanian Securitate concerning my father\'s detention and death as a political prisoner. In the Introduction as well as in the notes, comments and appendix, I discuss the ways in which such texts can be interpreted and their special status as texts written under torture, and address what they can teach us now about freedom and life.<br /><br />Finally, I also co-authored a book on didascalies, that was translated into Spanish and appeared in 2001 with a prestigious publishing house on Theater in Spain.<br /><br />2002<br /><br />I completed three books, two of which were partially funded by grants from the Romanian Department of Culture. The first&#151;<i>Chemarea m&#226;inilor negative /The Call of the Negative Hands</i>&#151;examines those films and texts by Duras that attest to the way in which intense reception of a work of art (such as the "negative hands" that appear in prehistoric caves of France/Spain, Moli&#232;re\'s Impromptu de Versailles, or Carn&#233;\'s Occupation film <i>Les Visiteurs du soir</i>) transforms it into the secret core of a new creation that is difficult to ascertain not only for the critic, but for the creator herself. This book contains a number of theoretical contributions to literary (or film) pragmatics, especially dealing with "cold" vs. "hot" reception and their formal correlates. I would connect it with an article on Sylvie Germain (also published in 2002), in which I examine the moving force behind Germain\'s writing.<br /><br />My other two publications were sociological books I edited: a massive volume by A. Golopentia and another on female charm-makers as personalities in a traditional Romanian village of the thirties. Because these authors, as well as the discipline of sociology, were practically suppressed in Romania for many years, editing these texts was a professional duty I felt happy to fulfill.<br /><br />Finally, I wrote four articles on the pragmatic approach to language/linguistics, in which I examined new ways of reading geolinguistic atlases and for defining the cultural identity of Franco-Americans in New-England, Romanian immigrants to the U.S., or Romanian minorities in Europe.<br /><br />In addition, in 2002 I was also at work preparing a book on the cultural identity of the Franco-Americans in New England. I spent the spring semester transcribing interviews and accumulating bibliographical information. I also took pleasure in giving invited lectures and interviews on the two books that have already appeared and on the "Carter emigrants" of the eighties, in reference to a special category of Romanian emigrants, among whom I situate myself.<br /><br />2003<br /><br />During my sabbatical I concentrated my efforts on a book examining the cultural identity of the Franco-Americans in New England. In the Fall semester 2002, I transcribed interviews and accumulated bibliographical information, while in the Spring 2003 I partially wrote two chapters, one dedicated to the parameters by which we define the cultural identity of a community, and the other presenting a number of Franco-American plays that have a polemic approach to the troubling issue of an unclear if not vanishing identity. <br />I gave a consistent number of lectures at the Centre National de la Recherch&#233; Scientifique (CNRS) and Sorbonne IV in France, at the Linguistic Institute of the Romanian Academy, and at The Transatlantic Project/Wayland Collegium. Specifically, these lectures dealt with the pragmatics of magic poetry, theater, and dialogue as well as with using informatic means to enhance our research and understanding in these domains. These lectures have been or will be published, and I hope they will lead to futher international cooperation in the future. During this year, I also enjoyed being invited to write entries on Benveniste, Caillois, Duras and Sollers for the <i>Companion to Modern French Thought</i>. <br /><br />In 2003, I also edited a book by Stefania Cristescu, dealing with female charm-makers as outstanding social and imaginary personalities in a traditional Romanian village of the thirties. Another editing project was my work on the first volume of a series entitled <i>The Epistolary Rhapsody</i> (over 600 p., from A to Crainic).  This volume, which contained letters received or written by Anton Golopentia between 1923 and 1949, gives a fascinating image of life in Romania and in Europe in between WWI and WWII. It combines letters by first-rank sociologists, demographers, anthropologists, or writers, with letters by young students, peasants, soldiers, and family that were addressed at various moments to sociologist and demographer A.G. The architectonics of this volume raised problems similar to those faced by novelists when they write large synthetic works aimed at summarizing a period. Meanwhile the contents of the letters made me better understand the pragmatics of the epistolary dialogue, on which I plan to write an extended study. <br /><br />2004<br /><br />During this year, I approached the subject of 20th-century French culture through a number of different works concerning E. Benveniste, Roger Caillois and Philippe Sollers. These pieces emerged from my work with the prestigious <i>Encyclopedia of Modern French Thought</i>, a study on the correspondence between Roger Caillois and Jean Paulhan about the avant-garde Coll&#232;ge de Sociologie, a study (and lecture) exploring the way in which being a sociologist and coming from a Francophile culture combined and/or conflicted in the careers of several young specialists of the 1930s, and a study of the fluctuations between the Romanian and the French cultural personas of Ionesco (entitled "Ionescu, Ionesco, Ionescu&#133;"). Together with Monique Martinez, I also initiated a project of electronic indexation for theatrical plays called DRAMA, for which I received a summer grant from the French University of Toulouse Le Mirail. The result of the project, which will be brought to technical completion by a graduate student at the University of Toulouse Le Mirail, will allow actors, directors and theater professors to affect a number of current operations on theatrical plays of their choice. To devise DRAMA we mainly worked on plays by Beckett and Sinisterra.<br /><br />In 2004, I also published two books, one self-authored (<i>Learn to Sing, My Mother Said</i>) and the other an edited edition (<i>The Epistolary Rhapsody</i>, vol. I), while working on another volume entitled <i>Romanians Beyond the River Bug</i>. All three volumes are what I call "polyphonic volumes" that give voice to diversified groups such as  women poets in a traditional Romanian village of the 1980s, intellectuals of various professions between WWI and WWII, and sociologists, demographers, and historians trying to account for the Romanians living in Ukraine since the 18th-century). All raise the problem of memory stratification (my research on female lyricism was conducted between 1970 and 1980; the letters in vol. I of the Epistolary Rhapsody were written between 1920s and 1950; and the Romanians in Ukraine were studied by scholars since the 19th- century and by a team of Romanian specialists in 1941&#150;1943). The last volume raises the problem of conflicting points of view since it contains the research of specialists who were later put to prison,  detainee declarations and reports by Securitate officers, as well as the memories and studies of the surviving researchers of the 1940s written fifty years later. Thus, while the substance of these books belongs to Romanian and Ukrainian cultures, their structure manifests and expands my theoretical interests in the pragmatics of culture and in the methods one can use to account for this cultural moment/setting and for intercultural relations.<br /><br />Stemming from my interest in cultural pragmatics were two studies and an invited lecture on the typology of love charms written in connection with the work of a Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique team (Langues&#150;Musiques&#150;Soci&#233;t&#233;s) in Paris and with a European group of researchers led by Jonathan Roper. These studies paved the way for an updating my database on Love Charms and putting it on the Web. For this project, I received a 2004/2005 Scholarly Technology Group (STG) Faculty Grant). I am currently engaged in this work, gathering unpublished material in various archives of oral literature. <br /><br />I have also published various articles on the American university (taking Brown University as an example, particularly with respect to the "Creative Writing" Program and Robert Coover\'s role in its development) in the prestigious review <i>Secolul XXI</i> (Century XXI). While cruising on the Danube with Brown Alumni, I also gave two lectures on the "Folklore of the Danube" and on the "Quests of Romanian Culture." All in all, my research in the pragmatics of culture was intensely connected with the quests of colleagues and teams in France, Romania, the U.S., and England and was focused on the encounters between French, Romanian, and Ukrainean cultures.<br /><br />2005<br /><br />Continuing my interest in theatre theory and criticism, I gave a lecture on Moliere\'s <i>L\'Impromptu de Versailles</i> (on the occasion of its presentation by the Trinity Rep Company) and I published a study on several unexpected ways to close a play in contemporary French Theater. The following week, I was invited to give a lecture on Jasmina Reza\'s theatrical endings in Canada at the University of Northwestern Ontario and another lecture on the theatrical Impromptu, viewed as a specifically French and Francophone development. During the summer, with the help of an Office for the Vice President for Research (OVPR) grant, I worked at the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale in Paris, accumulating a consistent bibliography for a book on Le Th&#233;&#226;tre de la Belle Epoque. I have by now, in draft form, two chapters (on Feydeau and on Claudel) as well as parts of the one on Renard and hope to conclude the work on the volume at the end of 2006.<br /><br />I also published a consistent study on the cultural encounter between French and Romanian sociologists at a moment (between WWI and WWII) when sociology experienced a prestigious, though strongly divergent development in the two countries. This is part of a new interest in Eastern European Francophilia that I share with a number of colleagues in the U.S.<br /><br />In a Colloquium dedicated to our colleague Inge Wimmers, I presented a paper on the multiple challenges one encounters when trying to translate oral texts. In the same pragmatic vein, I published an article on local variation at the level of speech acts based on my previous fieldwork in Maramuresh, Romania. I also gave a lecture and wrote an essay on "The Merry Cemetery of Sapantsa" with the occasion of an exhibition of photographs by Peter Kayafas at the Romanian Cultural Institute in New York. <br /><br />My research also included the continued devlopment of large-scale projects, such as the site of Magic Poetry (Romanian Love Charms) that I am developing with STG help, in addition to proof-reading and indexing a book on the Romanians between the rivers Bug and Dnestr. I also wrote essays for a special New York issue of the prestigious <i>Secolul XXI</i> review and for a volume on the communist fifties in Romania.'

S'A) Arithmetic algebraic geometry. Polylogarithms are the classical functions, which are at the same time the simplest period functions of variations of mixed Tate motives. They have many applications in arithmetic algebraic geometry: to special values of L-functions, motivic cohomology, motivic fundamental groups, etc.<br /><br />Investigation of the motivic fundamental groups of curves leads to generalizations of the classical polylogarithm functions, such as the multiple polylogarithms, and opens new directions.  <br /><br />In particular, we found a mysterious connection between the structure of the motivic fundamental groups of the projective line minus zero, infinity and N-th roots of unity and geometry of modular varieties for GL_m, for all m. <br />In the simplest nontrivial case, m=2, it is closely related to the Beilinson-Kato Euler system on the modular curves. <br /><br />The Hodge realization of the motivic fundamental groups of curves admits an explicit description via Feynman integrals, providing a first nontrivial application of the latter in arithmetic algebraic geometry. <br /><br />B) Higher Teichmuller theory and its quantization. Given  a pair (G,S), where G is a simple split real Lie group, and S a surface  (with a finite collection of marked points on the boundary), we defined and studied  a pair of moduli spaces  closely related to the moduli space of G-local systems on S.  <br /><br />The investigation of this pair of moduli spaces contains as special cases the following:<br /><br />i) when G=SL_2 and S is general -- the classical Teichm\\"uller-Thurston theory of surfaces, lamionations, etc.; <br /><br />ii) when S is very simple and G is general -- several aspects of the representation theory, e.g., Lusztig\'s theory of positivity and canonical bases,  Poisson-Lie/quantum groups.<br /><br />Thus, in a certain sense the emerging theory can be viewed as a marriage of the Teichm\\"uller  theory with representation theory. <br /><br />Using cluster varieties, we quantized these moduli spaces by using the quantum dilogarithm function. Our goal is to show that it delivers an infinite dimensional modular functor. <br /><br />C) Integral geometry. I worked on different aspects of this classical subject, e.g., suggested a D-module approach to integral gerometry.'

S'Inflammation, which is characterized by tissue infiltration by leukocytes, is a basic, yet complex biological reaction that is part of the innate immune response to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, antigens, damaged cells, toxicants and irritants. Inflammation is a protective attempt by the body to remove the injurious stimuli, as well as to initiate the healing process. An inflammatory response of appropriate magnitude and timing is crucial to tissue repair and homeostasis. Most inflammatory responses are acute and self-limiting; however, an excessive inflammatory reaction may result in critical and fatal conditions, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and acute renal failure. In addition, if the inflammatory response is prolonged or frequently relapsing, chronic persistent inflammation develops, which may promote fibrosis and loss of organ function. NSAIDs and immunosuppressants are widely used to treat excessive or chronic inflammation; however, no currently available therapy is completely effective. Moreover, a considerable number of patients suffer from the side effects of these treatments. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a novel therapy that could effectively control inflammation without significant adverse effect. Recent studies from our lab and other groups reproducibly proved that the potent anti-inflammatory action of hepatocyte growth factor and other growth factors and cytokines is mediated by the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 beta signaling.  <br /><br />The ongoing research of my lab centers on the regulatory role of GSK3beta signaling in the pathogenesis and development of inflammatory injury in diseased kidney. In addition, our research also focuses on the role of GSK3beta signaling in the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and renal fibrogenesis.  <br /><br />Other research interests of my lab include:<br /><br />1) Population genetics and epistasis in common kidney disease; <br /><br />2) Pathogenesis and corticotropin therapy for patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome;<br /><br />3) Immunopathogenesis of lupus nephritis; <br /><br />4) Mechanisms of acute kidney injury and repair;<br /><br />5) Pathogenic role of aldosterone in renal and cardiovascular injuries.'

S"The Scholarly Technology Group (STG) project:<br /><br />Katherine Goodman has been studying the 18th- century poet Luise Kulmus (Gottsched), as an exemplary figure of the German Enlightenment. Kulmus, born in Danzig, married Johann Christoph Gottsched, an important figure in the German enlightenment who was influenced primarily by French culture and reflected its style and ideas. To help counter this image of the German Enlightenment, Goodman will present Kulmus, who grew up in Danzig which was a major seaport with strong trading and intellectual ties to England and Holland. Luise Kulmus had access and was open to ideas from England much earlier than many in the interior of Germany. The advent of German interest in English literature is routinely dated at around 1750, but Luise Kulmus brought her interest into her marriage with Gottsched in 1735. Throughout the remainder of her life (until 1762) she worked full-time at his side and introduced works of the English Enlightenment (Addison, Steele, Pope) to German audiences (by translating them and reviewing them in her husband's periodicals).<br /><br /><br />This project will look at the young Kulmus through her and her husband's writing. It will contain short essays and notes by Goodman herself as well as images from the period. The Scholarly Technology Group (STG) is developing data structures for the text documents, and devising a hypertextual structure that will guide readers along Goodman's arguments, as well as allow them to explore the information on their own."

S"Much of Tom Goodwillie's work is connected with the circle of ideas called the calculus of functors. In one version, it seeks to describe the homotopy type of a function space, such as the space E(M,N) of embeddings of one manifold M in another manifold N, by using the overall structure of a functor E(-,N) whose domain is a category of subspaces of M. In another version, the objects of study are (values of) rather general functors in some larger setting &#150; for example, functors from the category of spaces to itself. In the latter version, the functors that take homotopy pushout diagrams to homotopy pullback diagrams play a key role; approximation of general functors by functors of this kind is analogous to the approximation of functions by linear functions. The first applications have been to Waldhausen's K-theory functor and to the identity functor. Goodwillie is currently exploring a larger pattern that includes these two examples."

S'Since completing his Ph.D. in Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965, Dr. Gould studied human cultural and behavioral adaptations to stress, risk, and uncertainty.  Initially these studies looked at living societies &#150; specifically, in NW California, in Australia\'s Western Desert, and in subarctic Finland &#150; and related the findings to archaeological remains.  This interest later extended to the study of shipwrecks and losses at sea, with underwater fieldwork in Bermuda and in the Dry Tortugas, FL.  He was Assistant Curator of North American Archaeology at the American Museum of Natural History, NY, (1965-71) and Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu (1971-81). He came to Brown University as Professor of Anthropology in 1981.  After the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, he led trial forensic recoveries at the WTC and full recoveries at "The Station" Nightclub Fire scene in West Warwick, RI, in 2003.  Most recently, he assisted with victim identifications and recoveries as a forensic anthropologist with the federal Disaster Mortuary Operations Recovery Team (DMORT) in Gulfport, MS, and in New Orleans/St. Bernard Parish, LA, immediately following hurricane Katrina.  Dr. Gould has published 12 books and monographs as well as 44 papers in peer-reviewed journals, 75 other articles (in Natural History, The Ecologist, Rhode Island History, Pacific Discovery, Masterkey, Archaeology, SAA Archaeological Record, The Encyclopedia of Underwater & Marine Archaeology, and the Oxford Companion to Archaeology), and 70 reviews and review articles.  He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and is a past-Chair of Section H (Anthropology) of the AAAS.  He was also a Fellow of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and past-Chair of the AAA Committee on Ethics.

S'We Cannot Remain Silent: Opposition to the Brazilian Military Dictatorship in the United States. Duke University Press, 2010.<br /><br />This political history of relations between the United States and Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s analyzes the various campaigns organized by clergy, exiles, and academics against the Brazilian military dictatorship. Linking activities in the United States to the political and social history of Brazil over two decades, this study argues that the different efforts to denounce human rights violations in Brazil prepared the groundwork for broader movements against authoritarian regimes in Central and South America in the 1970s and 1980s.<br /><br />New Research Projects:<br />"Gender, Sexuality, and Revolutionary Masculinity during the Brazilian Military Dictatorship."<br /><br />This project examines the interplay of shifts in gender and sexual norms in Brazil, as influenced by Brazilian and international cultural movements, and the student and revolutionary movements against the military dictatorship that ruled the country for two decades. Based on archival records, memoirs, and interviews with former student leaders, underground revolutionaries, and guerrilla leaders, this study analyzes the complexities of competing notions of gender and sexuality as countercultural values clashed with Marxist revolutionary constructions of appropriate masculinity. An article based on part of this research, "\'Who is the mach&#227;o who is going to kill me?\': Homosexuality, Revolutionary Masculinity, and the Brazilian Armed Struggle of the 1960s and 70s" will appear in Hispanic American Historical Review in 2012. <br /><br />"The Crossroads of Sin and the Collision of Cultures: Pleasure and Popular Entertainment in Rio de Janeiro, 1860-1920." <br /><br />This project is a social, cultural, and urban history of downtown Rio de Janeiro. My work examines the multiple layers of public sociability and everyday interactions that occurred in the city\'s public spaces before, during, and after the Brazilian belle &#233;poque in order to analyze how different social classes occupied and use similar public spaces and how race and gender influenced social interactions. This study should reveal larger patterns of urban sociability and, in turn, shed new light on our overall understanding of urban life in Brazil and Latin America. I have received competitive fellowships to work on this project from the Fulbright Program and the National Endowment of the Humanities. As an outgrowth of this research, I have also developed a collaborative project with Stanford University and the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) in Campinas, Brazil entitled "The Terrain of History: The Social and Cultural Geography of Nineteenth-Century Rio de Janeiro." This initiative combines past efforts and enables future collaboration among three urban history/geography research groups. All three projects focus on detailed reconstructions of urban spaces and histories in Rio de Janeiro during the nineteenth century. Through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) we have developed a combined mapping database and harmonized a common geospatial rubric in order to produce the most detailed and complete geohistorical archive ever assembled for a city in South America.

S'My focus is the pathophysiology and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). I use brain stimulation, cognitive probes, and neuroimaging to probe brain circuits implicated in symptom expression and in the response to treatment. Current neurobiological models propose that hyperactivity within circuits linking the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus is crucial to OCD symptoms. Our primary study attempts to reduce symptoms in patients with severe and treatment-refractory illness with electrical stimulation within these circuits, called deep brain stimulation (DBS). We also do PET imaging of regional brain function to determine if symptom improvement after DBS is associated with reductions in activity in these areas. Cognitive probes, some standard and some under develpment, are used to determine how information processing changes in the same brain circuits after DBS, and after stimulation of prefrontal cortex, using transcranial magnetic stimulation.<br /><br />Finally, a parallel study uses diffusion tensor MRI to develop detailed maps of brain fibers, to determine how brain connectivity changes after gamma knife capsulotomy, a neurosurgical treatment for people with intractable OCD. In capsulotomy, circumscribed lesions are made in white matter tracts connecting the thalamus to orbitofrontal cortex. Diffusion tensor MRI, capable of showing anatomical changes in these pathways at a distance from the primary lesion, may help define the anatomical changes most associated with therapeutic benefit after capsulotomy, and thus reveal more about the neuroanatomical underpinnings of OCD symptoms.'

S'Biodefense and emerging pathogens<br /><br />Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is one of the most infectious bacteria known to man, as few as 10 organisms can cause fatal disease.  Aerosolized F. tularensis represents a potentially dangerous biological weapon due to its high degree of infectivity, ease of dissemination, and capacity to cause severe illness.  No safe vaccine is presently available for general use.  Currently, our laboratory is conducting experiments to determine the factors that facilitate protective immunity to pneumonic tularemia using laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate relevant immune cell populations from the lungs of immune and non-immune mice infected with F. tularensis, and DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses to characterize gene expression.  The significance of specific gene products to host defenses will be determined by treating mice with sequence-specific siRNA to knock-down gene expression and product synthesis.  In response to an National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Biodefense initiative, experiments are also underway to develop a DNA-based vaccine and an immunization strategy to elicit protective mucosal immunity.  The efficacy of resultant vaccine candidates will be tested in "humanized," HLA class I and class II double-transgenic mice challenged with aerosolized F. tularensis.<br /><br />In addition to these studies, substantial effort in our laboratory is dedicated to delineating the factors that cause clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream and their elimination in the liver.  Previously, we reported that efficient elimination depends upon the complex interaction of resident tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) that line the liver sinusoids and bactericidal neutrophils, which accumulate rapidly in the liver in response to infection.   To our knowledge, these studies represent the first documented evidence to indicate that the critical function of Kupffer cells may relate far more to their ability to regulate the proinflammatory or antimicrobial activities of other cell types (e.g., neutrophils in this instance) than to their own capacity to ingest and kill microorganisms.  <br /><br />The ability of Kupffer cells to modulate the biological activity of other cells is supported by our recent studies demonstrating the Kupffer-cell-dependent abrogation of cholestatic liver injury in a mouse model.  Hepatocellular apoptosis and necrosis were exacerbated in Kupffer-cell-depleted or IL-6-deficient mice following ligation of the common bile duct.  Recombinant IL-6 administered at the time of surgery reversed the severe liver damage seen otherwise in Kupffer-cell-depleted animals, thus demonstrating the critical role of IL-6 in protection.  Similarly, invariant (i)NKT cells (a unique T cell population characterized by its ability to recognize glycolipids rather than peptides of host cell origin) alleviate liver injury in this model.  Relative to wild-type animals, iNKT cell-deficient mice exhibit increased liver damage following bile duct ligation.  This latter finding suggests the principal function of hepatic iNKT cells may be to moderate inflammation and suppress tissue injury rather than to mediate innate immunity to bacterial pathogens as broadly speculated in the literature.'

S"The ribosome is the central component of the universal protein synthesizing machinery, a highly cooperative 2.5 million Dalton RNA-protein complex that has been largely conserved throughout biological evolution. It is assumed that such conservation results from strong selective pressure against any structural changes which would have catastrophic consequences for function. Despite this conservation, the ribosome is surprisingly robust to mutation, capable of functioning with remarkable speed and accuracy even with base or amino acid substitutions at universally conserved residues. This paradox has yet to be resolved, in part because the structural consequences of such substitutions are not known in any detail. With the development of ribosome crystallography and genetic techniques, it is now possible to examine at high resolution the structural basis for the ribosome's robustness to mutation and address fundamental questions about RNA structure and ribosome evolution.<br /><br /><b>Mutational robustness of ribosome active sites</b><br />Many antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis by binding to ribosome functional centers, and antibiotic resistance can result from structural changes at these sites. Antibiotics thereby provide convenient genetic selections for targeting these highly conserved functional sites for mutation. We have developed the genetics of ribosomes of the bacterium <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>, the origin of a number of high-resolution ribosome crystal structures, and have identified many antibiotic-resistant mutants with base substitutions at conserved residues of either 16S or 23S rRNA. Such mutations create conformational distortions sufficient to influence ribosome-antibiotic interactions while maintaining ribosome structural integrity required for activity. In collaboration with the laboratories of Albert Dahlberg and Gerwald Jogl, we have begun to determine high-resolution crystal structures of these mutant ribosomes. Such experiments will allow us to ascertain how the ribosome accommodates structural changes into an active conformation and provide insights into the nature of the sequence conservation of ribosome active sites. <br /><br /><b>Compensatory evolution</b><br />Antibiotic-resistance mutations usually carry a substantial fitness cost, by virtue of their location in functionally important sites. This fitness cost implies that reversion to sensitivity should arise in populations after removal of antibiotic from the environment. Contrary to expectations, experimental evolution studies have shown that cultures of resistant mutants grown in the absence of antibiotics do not generally revert to sensitivity, but instead acquire compensatory mutations that improve fitness. Currently little is know about the nature of such compensatory mutations or the mechanism by which they improve fitness. To address these questions, we are applying an experimental evolution approach to identify compensatory mutations that restore fitness to antibiotic-resistant mutants of <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>. X-ray crystallography of such ribosomes is expected to explain the structural basis for fitness compensation. These experiments also have the potential to reveal previously unrecognized functional relationships between components of the ribosome."

S'Professor Grenander\'s research work involves inference for stochastic processes; insurance mathematics; probability theory on algebraic structures; nonparametric statistics; a general pattern theory and its applications to model-based image analysis.  His work also involves a broad range of seminal contributions within the area of Applied Mathematics, and upon the ongoing development of a remarkable Pattern Theory and its applications to image analysis.  He was among the first to show the utility of functional-analytic methods in the theory of inference for stochastic processes. Early work also includes fundamental contributions to the spectral analysis of time series and breakthrough developments in the application of mathematics to insurance.  He was among the first to extend probability and its associated limit theory to general algebraic structures, a recently rediscovered and exciting branch of modern probability and statistics.  In recent years he has pioneered the use of computers for experimental mathematics.  <br /><br />Grenander\'s most recent, and ongoing, contributions are among his most innovative and important.  Convinced that regularities of natural patterns reveal important common themes, he has devised an algebraic/probabilistic theory of regular structures.  This theory, substantive in its practical, computational and mathematical content, has inspired mathematical scientists throughout the world.  The term "Pattern Theory" was introduced by Ulf Grenander in the 70\'s as a name for a field of applied mathematics which gave a theoretical setting for a large number of related ideas, techniques and results from fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, image and acoustic signal processing, pattern recognition and its statistical side, neural nets and parts of artificial intelligence.  The problem that "Pattern Theory" aims to solve, may be described as follows - the analysis of the patterns generated by the world in any modularity, with all their naturally occurring complexity and ambiguity, with the goal of reconstructing the processes, objects and events that produced them and of predicting these patterns when they reoccur. <br /><br />Professor Grenander\'s current research interests focus on the the creation of a new theory of regular structure (pattern theory) and its application to the actual and man-made world.  Also of interest is the development of the theory of statistical inference on stochastic processes and abstract spaces, by functional analytic methods.  Work is directed toward the development of algorithms for medical image processing, and a unified theory of automatic target recognition.<br /><br />At present he is working on a model GRID intended to serve as a basis for the analysis of MRIs under growth conditions; also on a mathematical theory of the mind expressed in terms of pattern theory.'

S"Most of my efforts since moving to Brown in 1966 have gone into creating a mathematical theory of patterns, starting from algebraic considerations, based on which are probabilistic results (metric pattern theory) and methods of inference (pattern inference). The latter are implemented as algorithms and computer programs intended to analyze and understand patterns of various types: pictures, syntactic patterns, logical structures, social systems, and patterns of doctrines.<br /><br />Up to the early 1980's this work was of purely theoretical nature. Starting at this time I and my group in the Division of Applied Mathematics have tried to apply these ideas to practical tasks in pattern analysis, in particular to image restoration. The images can<br />have been acquired using different technologies such as visible light digital cameras, infrared, X-rays, tomographic techniques, and more recently laser radar.  Among current research topics that I am studying one can mention global models for highly variable shapes (such that occur in anatomy), 3-D recognition (restoration based on range data), and MRI and CT imaging based on mathematical models using background deformations. The main theme in this research has been to exploit the interaction between mathematics of a new type (pattern theory) and advances in high technology (computer architectures, languages, and new sensors)."

S"Our laboratory is focused on the mechanisms that regulate normal and abnormal cellular growth.  We use the liver as a model system to study the control of hepatocyte proliferation during normal liver development, liver regeneration and liver injury.  We do so based on the premise that understanding normal hepatocyte growth regulation will provide insight into abnormal growth (cancer) and the proliferative response of the liver's facultative stem cells to liver injury. We have concentrated on the following areas: developmental stage-specific alterations in hepatocyte mitogenic signaling, changes in translation control during the perinatal period, and hepatocyte cell cycle control during development. Our model system is the rat and mouse with a particular focus on the tripling of liver mass that takes place during the last several days of gestation. Our work employs both in vitro (primary culture and hepatic cell lines) and in vivo approaches. <br /><br />We have arrived at a rather unexpected picture of how hepatocyte proliferation is regulated through late fetal and postnatal development. Our data indicate that the stimulation for rapid fetal hepatocyte growth is largely independent of the signal transduction pathways that stimulate the proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes. A manifestation of this difference between fetal and adult hepatocyte growth control is the resistance of fetal hepatocytes to the growth (translation and cell cycle) inhibitory effects of the drug rapamycin.  Rapamycin resistance is a characteristic previously attributed to transformed cell types.  In pursuing this observation, we have identified translation control and cell cycle control mechanisms that appear to relate to the dysregulated growth seen in the liver's response to carcinogens and injury."

S'Preclinical evidence that targeting the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is effective in cancer treatment has been accumulating for almost two decades. Efforts to develop drugs began in the late 1990s, and initial data from clinical trials were reported in 2006. The biologic rationale for IGF-IR targeting has potential relevance to many tumor types, and early results have justified expanded programs to evaluate IGF-IR targeting agents in many areas of clinical need. More than two dozen drug candidates have been developed and clinical trials are underway for at least 12 of these. Early clinical trials reveal an acceptable safety profile together with pharmacodynamic evidence that the receptor can be successfully targeted. It is premature to draw conclusions regarding efficacy, but well-documented instances of single-agent activity were noted during phase I evaluations, and recent evidence from a phase II study suggests that co-administration of an anti-IGF-IR antibody with chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer improves objective response rate and progression-free survival. With more than 70 trials involving a variety of drug candidates, the IGF-IR is becoming one of the most intensively investigated molecular targets in oncology. Early results justify the continuation of ongoing research across a broad range of cancer indications.'

S'Mechanics of Energy Storage Materials<br />&#9;Developing lithium ion batteries with higher energy density is considered to be an important challenge of our times in order to enable electric vehicles that can compete and hopefully replace internal combustion engine driven vehicles. Developing  the next generation of Li-ion batteries requires designing new anodes, cathodes and electrolytes that can survive thousands of charge-discharge cycles with minimal capacity fading. Stresses in the electrode materials not only determine the mechanical integrity & cycle life, but also influence the electrochemical performance.  It is essential to understand the mechanics of damage evolution in the electrode materials in order to develop predictive models to help battery designers in arriving at optimal material designs. <br />&#9;Motivated by such practical applications, we pursue a number of exciting problems at the interface between solid mechanics and chemistry. For example, we recently demonstrated the role of plastic deformation on the energy recovery efficiency of silicon based anodes; coupling between stress and electric potential in silicon; and the evolution of mechanical properties of silicon as a function of Li concentration. A number of other related phenomena are under current investigation. Our effort in this area is currently funded by NSF (MRSEC), NASA and the State of Rhode Island.<br /><br /><br />Mechanics of Biologically Inspired Adhesion, Friction and Engineered Surfaces:<br /><br />&#9;The ability of small animals such as insects, flies and geckos to climb up vertical walls and to walk up side down on ceilings has been a subject of active research in biology for many centuries. There are a variety of mechanisms employed by these animals, including tiny claws, adhesive secretions, smooth and hairy adhesive pads, etc. Following the accumulation of a large body of anatomical and functional data on various natural adhesion systems, in the last few years biologists and engineers have been working together to develop a quantitative understanding of various natural adhesion and friction systems. This is a growing field of research with a rich set of challenging problems at the interface between biology, applied mechanics and micro/nano-fabrication, with potentially significant benefits if we can understand and mimic some of nature\'s optimized solutions to develop useful technologies.  <br />&#9;The focus of this research is on engineering the topography of surfaces at micron and nano scale in order to understand the mechanics of biological adhesion and friction systems; and to develop biomimetic strategies which implement nature\'s mechanisms for adhesion and friction. Such a study naturally leads to several basic mechanics problems in rough surface adhesion and friction of soft materials, which are currently being investigated in detail. Some of the specific problems being addressed are: Mechanics of direction dependent friction (Friction Anisotropy) exhibited by biological surfaces and implementing such strategies on laboratory surfaces; Mechanics of roughness induced instabilities at nano and micron scales; Optimal design and fabrication of nano-hairy surfaces. The common features that underlie this class of problems are fabrication of nano-structuree surfaces, coupling between adhesion and deformation of the surface nano-structures, and mechanical instabilities at nano and micron scale to dissipate energy and influence the macroscopic behavior. The key idea is to manipulate surface topography at nano and micron scale to tailor macroscopic adhesion and friction properties; not surface chemistry. This work is supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nanofabrication Strategies by means of Guided Assembly: <br /><br />Fabricating ordered patterns of controlled shape, size and spacing at nanoscale has been an important goal of nano-scale science and engineering during the past decade. Applications envisaged for such processes include quantum dot devices, nanocomposites, high density data storage devices, etc. Most of the existing nanofabrication techniques can be loosely described as either top-down type or bottom-up type. The top-down approach consists of examples such as photolithography, X-ray lithography, scanning probe/e-beam lithography etc. On the other hand, in the bottom-up approach, one tries to exploit certain configurational forces acting at nanoscale to drive a self-assembly process. However, there are a number of issues associated with the "self-assembly" route of fabricating devices of practical utility. For example, in case of strain driven quantum dot growth in semiconductor thin films, the resulting nanostructures usually do not possess any spatial order and also end up with a non-uniform size distribution. The objective of this project is to develop nanofabrication techniqes that combine the driving configurational forces that underlie self-assembly processes and the spatial control that can be achieved in top-down processes, in order to realize any desired spatial pattern and size distribution of nanostructures. Currently, we are exploring the use of "very strong" electric and magnetic fields at solid surfaces to induce diffusion and patterning. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation. <br /><br /><br /><br />Mechanics of Carbon Nanotubes:<br /><br />&#9;Research on the mechanics of carbon nanotubes has been dominated by modeling and computational simulations, primarily due to the extreme difficulty involved in performing controlled experiments on such small structures. The goal of this project is to develop new nanoscale experimental techniques to apply controlled force on individual nanotubes, measure the deflection at nanometer resolution and develop mechanics models to describe the experimental observations. We have recently developed an experimental technique to study shell buckling in individual multiwalled carbon nanotubes and showed that the measured buckling force is substantially higher than that predicted by the existing models. Motivated by these experimental observations, improved shell theories are being developed. Funding source: AFOSR.'

S'My research interests focus on basic learning processes, such as timing, choice, and appetitive and aversive conditioning, and on the application of these processes to human problems, such as masochism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<br /><br />While obtaining my clinical psychology license in Brazil, I felt the increased necessity to relate basic research to clinical problems. The clinical work provided me with interesting problems but few solutions. It was difficult to study these problems under the clinical settings, with limited control of relevant variables. My decision was to simplify; I decided to investigate behavior in well-controlled environments with organisms with a known history. Since then, the focus of my research career has been to understand basic learning processes with rats and pigeons. My basic research includes topics such as the dynamics of acquisition and extinction of conditioned behavior, temporally controlled behavior, and the relationship between timing, conditioning, and choice. I have also used different theoretical models of behavior such as the Rescorla & Wagner Model, Scalar Timing Theory, Learning to Time, and Packet Theory to explain these data. This research provided me the skills to work successfully with large amounts of data, in order to describe the behavior of individuals and groups of subjects, quantitatively fit theories to the data, and evaluate fits of different theories to the data using different criteria, such as a Turing test (Church & Guilhardi, 2005).<br /><br />The findings from my own research, as well as from others, have provided me with innovative procedures, stable behavioral measures, and theoretical explanations that can be used to study clinical problems in simple environments through the use of animal models. The general approach has made it possible for me to integrate topics, such as conditioning, timing, and choice, that were often investigated with different methods and theories. The focus of my current research has been to integrate those topics even further using an animal model of attention deficit disorder (ADHD). This direction of research will provide the identification of determining variables related to the etiology, symptom, and treatment. This identification promises to provide an outstanding tool that can be used with children. <br /><br />My early career training<br /><br />As an undergraduate I was awarded a research fellowship to investigate aversive control in rats; more specifically, to investigate mechanisms under which rats maintain high rates of responding even though responding was frequently and severely punished with electric shock. This research led to the conclusions that behavior that is frequently and severely punished is only maintained if the frequency and intensity of punishment is gradually introduced, and if the behavior is also reinforced. The underlying basic principles provided by this research had close relationship to human problems, such as masochism. In 1997, I was the recipient of a "Young Investigator Award" for my work in this area.<br /><br />This research provided me the opportunity to understand basic processes and relate them to applied human problems. The nature of the explanation, however, was based on qualitative descriptions of the relationships between the independent and dependent variables. In 1998, as a junior in college, I had the opportunity to conduct research with Dr. Armando Machado at Indiana University. Dr. Machado introduced me to the study of timing behavior and quantitative explanatory models of behavior. This research tested predictions of two influential theories of timing, Scalar Timing Theory (SET) and Learning to Time (LeT), and was published in the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior (Machado & Guilhardi, 2000).<br />Basic research: acquiring skills, developing methods, and fitting theories to data.<br /><br />A fascination for basic and applied research, the quantification of behavior, and the timing behavior led me to pursue the Ph.D. under mentorship of Dr. Russell M. Church in the Timing Lab at Brown University. During these years at Brown University, I have investigated how the temporal relationship between environmental cues (e.g. occurrence of stimuli such as noise) and reinforcements (e.g. food delivery) can be used to predict the learning of the pattern and rate of behavior of rats. A quantitative theory of timing and conditioning, Packet Theory, has been extended to account for the behavior trained under many procedures.<br /><br />In a paper published in Learning & Behavior (Guilhardi & Church, 2005), Packet Theory was extended to predict the dynamics of temporal discrimination. The theory predicted different patterns of results produced by different dependent measures of acquisition. The fits to these dependent measures with different patterns were based on a single set of parameters. These, and other, dependent measures of fixed-interval performance, as well as analysis tools, were published in Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers (Guilhardi & Church, 2004). This publication also provided a case study of the data archiving and secondary data analysis. <br /><br />Packet Theory was also extended to account for pattern and rate of responses under fixed and random interval schedules, and under schedules in which multiple time-markers are present and used as cues to the delivery of reinforcement. In addition, the theory was used to predict the tendency of behavior to occur in bouts of responses. This extension of the model was presented at the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior (SQAB) and published in a special issue on the "quantitative analysis of behavior" in Behavioural Processes (Guilhardi, Keen, MacInnis, & Church, 2005).<br /><br />In addition to acquisition, a series of papers addressed the response rate and pattern of temporal discrimination behavior after extensive extinction. Results showed that the memory for interval duration was preserved after extensive extinction when the conditions of acquisition and extinction were similar, learning of new intervals and context occurred during extinction when the conditions of acquisition and extinction differed (Guilhardi & Church, 2006). The dynamics of acquisition and extinction of temporal discrimination were also studied. The speed of acquisition was faster than the speed of acquisition. The Rescorla & Wagner model with the addition of a linear response-mapping rule was sufficient to account for the acquisition and extinction of response rate(Guilhardi, Yi, & Church, 2006). Another manuscript extended packet theory to account for the dynamics of extinction in addition to the dynamics of acquisition. An explicit solution of the theory has also been described (Guilhardi, Yi, & Church, submitted).<br /><br />Current and future directions: integrating basic and applied research<br /><br />I have reviewed the literature on animal models of ADHD and was dissatisfied with the current analogy of the hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attention deficit. Moreover, I was dissatisfied with a lack of studies exploring etiological and treatment aspects. At the same time, I found that my research (Guilhardi, 2005) had provided me with a behavioral procedure, behavioral measures, and theoretical explanations that could be directly used to develop and evaluate current animal models of ADHD. The procedure designed to relate timing, conditioning, and choice, provided independent measures of response rate, response pattern, and discrimination accuracy. These measures were directly related to the three symptoms described in ADHD: response rate was related to hyperactivity, response pattern to impulsivity, and discriminative accuracy to attention deficit. The development of this task along with a quantitative theory to explain the results, provide tools to study ADHD. As an Assistant Professor Research at Brown University, I am currently testing hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attention deficit in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), a strain often used as a genetic model of ADHD. <br /><br />In the future, I plan to try to isolate these measures and investigate effects of different independent variables on them. The study of the conditions under which the symptoms are exacerbated or eliminated in a simple laboratory environment will provide information about the processes underlying the etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of ADHD. Further development of the SHR model will provide a better understanding of the etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of ADHD. <br /><br />In addition to conducting research on ADHD with rats, I intend to collect data using similar procedures with children diagnosed with ADHD and controls. In fact, this research is currently being implemented at Brown University. In addition, details for future research collaboration with children are concurrently being discussed with two major universities (Universidade Federal de S&#227;o Carlos and Universidade de Campinas), and a clinical institute (Instituto de An&#225;lise do Comportamento de Campinas) in Brazil. <br /><br />Another direction of research has recently been established through collaborations with Dr. Mark Laubach at Yale University and Rebecca Burwell at Brown University. This research will provide pre-frontal cortex single unit recordings from rats while performing a task similar to the one I am currently using to evaluate and develop the SHR model of ADHD. Collaborations with researchers who have experience with clinical populations as well as collaborations with researchers investigating the neurobiological bases of behavior, combined with my research skills using behavioral procedures, provides an integrative approach that will certainly produce outstanding outcomes. Such integrative approach is ambitious but realistic.'

S'Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is one of the most common and preventable causes of birth defects. It results in a clinical condition known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the key findings. The pathogenesis of ethanol-induced IUGR is not fully characterized. Using in vivo and in vitro experimental models, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the ethanol-induced intrauterine growth restriction. We examine the effects of ethanol on placental morphology and trophoblastic cell function. We are particularly interested in invasive trophoblastic cells because they are important mediators of implantation and placentation. We demonstrated that aspartyl-asparaginyl beta-hydroxylase (AAH) has a key role in trophoblastic cell motility and that ethanol inhibits the expression levels of AAH. Since AAH is regulated by insulin and IGF signaling pathways, we are investigating the ethanol effects on insulin-IGF signaling pathways. We anticipate that these studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced intrauterine growth restriction and improve therapeutic strategies.'

S"Professor Guo's research is concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of partial differential equations arising in various scientific applications. More specifically, he has been working on PDE arising in<br />the kinetic theory of statistical physics, especially in connection with the nonlinear stability of their steady states.  Kinetic theory is concerned with the study of the dynamics of a large ensemble of 'particles'. Interestingly, such abstract 'particles' can be tiny<br />gas molecules, or enormous stars in a galaxy. The most fundamental equation in the kinetic theory for describing gas molecules is the celebrated Boltzmann equation.  Many fundamental macroscopic fluid<br />equations, such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, can be derived from the Boltzmann theory. He has been working on stability of Maxwellian states in the Boltzmann theory. In a kinetic theory of stars, collisions among stars are sufficiently rare to be ignored. Therefore, a galaxy or a globular cluster can be modeled as an<br />ensemble of particles, i.e., stars, which interact only by the gravitational field which they create collectively. The time evolution of a galaxy can then be described by the Vlasov theory. There are many well known steady state galaxy models. Professor Guo has been developing mathematical tools to analyze the dynamical stability of these steady galaxy models. Instabilities of equilibria in many physical and biological sciences has always attracted great attention.  It is important, from a scientific point of view, to understand the rate, time scale, structure, pattern and dynamics of various instabilities in a fully nonlinear setting. Professor Guo has been working on developing general mathematical framework to prove and characterize such nonlinear instabilities."

S'Dr. Haddow\'s research focuses in the general area of medical screening, with ongoing emphasis on prenatal screening for serious fetal and maternal disorders.  This work, by definition, falls under the heading of "clinical" or "applied" research and relies on promising discoveries at the basic science level, which are ready to be taken into a translational phase and assessed for feasibility in everyday practice.  This interest began in the mid-1970s, when the first biochemical marker (alpha-fetoprotein) for detecting a serious fetal disorder (open spina bifida) was discovered by David Brock, in Edinburgh.  Initially, measurement of alpha-fetoprotein was limited to amniotic fluid and could only be justified when a woman had experienced a previous pregnancy with spina bifida, or a related neural tube defect, such as anencephaly.  This seriously restricted the application of this important discovery, because fewer than 5% of spina bifida cases delivered in a given year were to women known to be at high risk.  A second follow-up discovery by Brock, in collaboration with Nicholas Wald, demonstrated that alpha-fetoprotein levels were also elevated in maternal serum during the second trimester in the presence of fetal open spina bifida.  These levels were not as clearly separated from those of unaffected pregnancies as in amniotic fluid, however, meaning that maternal serum might be suitable for screening, but not diagnostic, purposes.  A 19-center collaborative study was then begun in the U.K. to test the feasibility of this new screening process, and several investigators in the U.S., including Dr. Haddow, began to explore how this type of screening process might be made to work in a decentralized health care system.  This early work on both sides of the Atlantic led to initiating the era of prenatal screening, which now extends to include detection of a number of other serious fetal disorders (most notably, Down syndrome) and has substantially reduced the birth prevalence of these conditions.<br /><br />As a first step, it was necessary for Dr. Haddow to develop reagents for measuring alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), because none were available at that time from commercial sources.  This included isolating and purifying AFP from cord blood, producing antibodies to the isolate in an animal source, setting up a double-antibody assay using radioactive tracers, and establishing reference ranges.  Once the assay was in place, it became possible to design a model system for introducing the testing process via primary care physician offices throughout the state of Maine.  This was the first statewide pilot prenatal screening project in the U.S. and contained the prototype materials and protocols that are now a standard component of prenatal screening programs.  A major feature of the project\'s design was the outreach connection between laboratory and clinician, in which the laboratory provided informational materials for both health professionals and patients, included both interpretations and recommended actions on the laboratory report, and served as a central resource to answer questions arising at the office level.  The success of this design served as an example for others who considered introducing screening in the U.S. and demonstrated that prenatal screening could be successfully applied in a decentralized healthcare system. Three international conferences were organized by Dr. Haddow (1977, 1978, 1980) to bring together scientists, policy makers, reagents industry representatives, third party payers, patient advocates, and government agencies to examine the progress and potential of this rapidly emerging technology.<br /><br />All of Dr. Haddow\'s subsequent research is built upon this background, and selected examples follow:<br /><br /><ol><li>Studies involving smoking in pregnancy&#151;Dr. Haddow and colleagues became interested in the potential of using cotinine measurements to assess pregnant women\'s exposure to tobacco smoke. Once again, it was necessary to construct an assay for cotinine and then apply it to serum samples from a cohort of women in the second trimester. We confirmed the association between smoking and adverse outcomes, such as low birth weight, and then carried out a randomized intervention trial, using cotinine as the basis for persuading women to stop smoking. This study was superimposed on our statewide screening program for spina bifida.</li><br /><li>New biochemical markers to improve screening for Down syndrome&#151;As collaborators with Jack Canick and Nicholas Wald, we reported the discovery of unconjugated estriol as a new screening marker for Down syndrome and demonstrated that it could be successfully combined with two other markers to substantially improve screening performance. A subsequent intervention trial by us in Maine and Rhode Island demonstrated its feasibility in practice.</li><br /><li>Impact of maternal thyroid deficiency on fetal brain development&#151;Using sera stored in the freezer from a cohort of screened pregnancies, we retrospectively identified women with thyroid deficiency during pregnancy and tested their offspring at age eight years, documenting that untreated maternal thyroid deficiency was associated with lower I.Q.</li><br /><li>A new methodology for evaluating genetic tests&#151;As an extension of our ongoing interest in new test application, we designed a new assessment tool for DNA tests, called ACCE (Analytic Validity, Clinical Validity, Clinical Utility, and ELSI). This tool has now been applied to several candidate screening tests outside of the prenatal screening area.</li></ol>'

S"Dr. Haddow earned a B.A. degree from Harvard in 1957 and an M.D. degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1961.  He completed a rotating internship at Maine Medical Center in 1962 and a residency in Pediatrics at Boston City Hospital (BCH) in 1964.  From 1964 to 1966, he served in the United States Army as a Pediatrician at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and from 1966 to 1967 he had a fellowship in Pediatric Metabolism and Endocrinology at BCH.  From 1967 to 1974, he was an Assistant Director of the Pediatric Clinical Center and Director of Pediatric Endocrinology at BCH.  In 1974, he moved to Maine to take a position with the Rheumatic Disease Laboratory at the Maine Medical Center.  In that position, he became interested in the discipline of medical screening, initially in the specific area of prenatal screening.  In the following years, at the Foundation for Blood Research, he established an internationally recognized research program in prenatal screening and extended his interests to include other areas of medical screening, such as hemochromatosis, thyroid deficiency, and breast cancer.  He is now the Director of the Division of Medical Screening at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island.  He has written numerous chapters for medical texts and hundreds of scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals.  He is recognized as one of the world's experts in translating research into clinical practice in the area of medical screening."

S'The following research projects on airway and vascular smooth muscle cells are potentially significant for understanding the basic mechanisms of inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma, and prolifierative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.<br /><br /><b>Systems Biology of Inflammatory Gene Expression in Airway Smooth Muscle:</b><br />Airway smooth muscle cells produce multiple inflammatory products in response to multiple inflammatory stimuli.  This project tests the hypothesis that Erk1/2, p38, and JNK MAPK kinases, MAPK phosphatase, and COX enzymes are the core processes that regulate redundancy, robustness, and temporal dynamics in the system of inflammatory gene expression.   Experimental approaches include the measurement of inflammatory gene expression by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immuno-histochemistry.  Mathematical approach includes kinetic modeling using WinSAAM (Windows version of Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling).  <br /><br /><b>Regulation of Podosome Dynamics in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells:</b><br />Podosomes are cytoskeletal structures that regulate the release of metalloproteinase and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, podosomes are potentially important for proliferative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. This project tests the hypothesis that PKC, Erk1/2 MAPK, and caldesmon regulate podosome dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cells.  PKC and Erk1/2 MAPK are signaling molecules involved in the regulation of podosome dynamics.  Caldesmon is an actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal remodeling and contractility.  Erk1/2 MAPK and caldesmon are both regulated by phosphorylation.  Experimental approaches include cell culture, overexpression of mutant proteins by transfection confocal immuno-fluorescence microscopy, live-cell imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and Western blotting.'

S"Carcinoid tumors arise in the gastrointestinal tract from the neuroendocrine enterochromaffin cells of the intestinal epithelium and over the course of years metastasize to the liver and lung. The carcinoid syndrome is caused by the tumor's release of serotonin and other vasoactive substances.  As these are small tumors resection is impossible and other current treatments are inadequate. Damage to cardiac tissue is the leading cause of death associated with carcinoid syndrome.  Our goal is to determine the critical cellular factors involved in carcinoid tumor growth and secretion of bioactive amines that damage cardiac tissue. These cellular factors will be targeted using specific shRNA and/or other inhibitory factors. These molecules will then be specifically targeted to the tumors using a unique viral delivery method. <br /><br /><br />Biography <br />2006-present, Assistant Professor of Research, Brown University, Providence, RI <br /><br />2003-2006, Post-Doctoral Research Associate, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI <br /><br />2001-2003, Post-Doctoral Research Associate, Brown University, Providence, RI <br /><br />1995-2001, Graduate Student, Brown University, Providence, RI <br /><br />1994-1995, Graduate Student, Georgetown University, Washington DC <br /><br />1991-1994, Research Associate, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes <br />of Health, Bethesda, MD <br /><br />1987-1991, Assistant Research Scientist, GeneTrak Systems, Framingham, MA"

S"My current research includes work on children and youth during the mass civil rights movement with critical analysis on the nature of activism.  <br /><br />_Crossroads at Clarksdale_ (UNC Press, 2012) studies the civil rights movement in Coahoma County, Mississippi from 1951 to the present. Three points of inquiry frame this work. First, I reinstate women's roles as paramount to the successful maneuverings at the local level and I recast their own understanding of those roles in their own terms, using the trope of motherhood and motherwork to reinterpret leadership. Second, I track the movement of organizations in the local area, analyzing those that passed through and those that stayed in order to better understand when and how organizations succeed in their goals given the multitude of variables the members confronted, and I utilize my concept of flexible loyalties to describe how local people consciously used the groups to fulfill their own needs, Finally I reassess the difference that community activism and group cooperation made for the success of social programs. By ending the project at the eve of the millennium, I question the conventional periodization of the civil rights movement as has been memorialized by political, social and cultural historians. How do we calculate the success of a movement?"

Before arriving in Cambridge, she had studied Classics at the University of Michigan (B.A.) and the University of California, Berkeley (M.A.); she has also spent a brief spell at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. Much of her recent and current research is driven by an interest in the reception of classical (i.e. 5th century Athenian) tragedy in antiquity, as well as by the question of how it came to be that we have (only) the plays that we have today. (She sees those questions as very much connected.) She is also interested in Greek theatrical production, performance in classical Athens, and in the interrelated poetics and politics of the Great Dionysia and the Athenian <i> epitaphios logos</i>."

S'Having been trained as an architect and architectural historian, my research has always been involved with questions of space and spatiality, particularly the social production of space in the ancient Near Eastern world. I am however increasingly interested in questions of place and landscape, especially how archaeological and ethno-historical projects study culturally meaningful places. I am currently working on a monograph that attempts to develop what I call "an archaeology of place". <br /><br />Archaeological research is usually dependant upon rigorous fieldwork. In the summer of 2010, I initiated  the Brown University based and funded <a href=http://proteus.brown.edu/eventplace/Home>Yalburt Yaylasi Archaeological Landscape Research Project</a>, a five-year diachronic regional survey project in West-Central Turkey, in the environs of a Hittite (Late Bronze Age) sacred pool complex and dam. I am also currently involved with projects at Gordion and Ayanis in Turkey. At Gordion, a Phrygian site in Central Anatolia, I have been working on the Early Iron age building technologies and more recently the final publication of Middle Phrygian architecture from the site. At Ayanis, I have worked on the use of stone in the architecture of this Urartian city, located on the Eastern shore of Lake Van in Eastern Turkey. Starting in 2007, I have become affiliated with <a href=http://proteus.brown.edu/harmansah/4460>an ethnoarchaeological project at Ayanis</a>, where I took on the task of documenting architectural traditions and building technologies at the nearby village of Ayanis. My first monograph entitled <i>Cities and the Shaping of Memory in the Ancient Near East</i> will be published by Cambridge University Press.'

S'Disorders of esophageal motor function and competence of the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES), for instance gastroesophageal reflux disease, affect more than one in ten adults over 40 and one in four adults over 60 years of age.<br /><br />Our research is focused on the mechanisms mediating contraction of the smooth muscle in the esophagus and LES, in normal conditions and during inflammation.  We use human esophageal specimens from organ donors, when available, or the cat esophagus as a model for the human esophagus.  We study signal transduction mediating contraction of circular muscle from the body of the esophagus and LES and the sequence of events responsible for the onset and development of inflammation and for alterations in esophageal and LES motor function. <br /><br />We find that acid-induced esophageal inflammation begins with refluxed acid activating proton-sensitive vanilloid type 1 receptor or transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), present in the esophageal mucosa, resulting in production of the neurotransmitters substance P and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) and of platelet activating factor (PAF). PAF diffuses to the muscle layer and induces the production of several inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1&#61538;,  H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), and more PAF by muscle cells. These inflammatory mediators reduce esophageal contraction by inhibiting release of acetlycholine (ACh) from cholinergic nerves.<br /><br />These data suggest that esophagitis may begin from activation of TRPV1 receptors in esophageal mucosal epithelial cells, and that PAF may be an important factor contributing to alterations in motor function that are associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease.'

Interested candidates should email their CV and the names of 3 references to Elizabeth_Harrington@brown.edu***  <br /><br />Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of twelve serine-threonine kinases.   Each PKC isoform is thought to have its own discrete activators, cofactors, and substrates; however, few have been identified.   PKC activity has been shown to be critical in endothelial cell functions, including proliferation, migration, adhesion, apoptosis, barrier function, tube formation, and cell cycle progression.   Currently, we have two avenues of investigation underway.  <br /><br />The main goal of the first project is to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which PKCdelta regulates endothelial monolayer permeability.   We hypothesize that PKCdelta regulates endothelial basal barrier function by stabilizing adhesive forces of microfilaments and focal contacts through a RhoA GTPase-dependent signaling pathway.<br /><br />The main focus of the second project is to elucidate signaling pathways which are differentially activated in microvascular endothelial cells in response to oxidative stress.   Our hypothesis is that endothelial cells from pulmonary and systemic vascular beds differ in response to oxidative stress and subsequent induction of apoptosis.'

S'A few of Professor Harris\'s noteworthy results:                                         <br /><br />1."On the Homotopy Groups of the Classical Groups," <i>Annals of Math</i> (1961), and "Suspensions and Characteristic Maps for Symmetric Spaces," <i>Annals of Math</i> (1962). The Classical compact simple Lie groups come in four infinite series: SU(n), SO(2n), SO(2n+1), SP(n). In the mid 1950s, Bott had calculated their homotopy groups in dimensions i (Bott Periodicity), but only for i less than 2n. These groups are completely determined by their Dynkin diagrams (just dots and lines) which contain a complete set of assembly instructions, just like a chromosome. Two of the series, SO(2n+1) and Sp(n), have diagrams which are identical except for one wrong-way arrow. Based just on this observation, Serre made the surprising conjecture that their homotopy groups in all dimensions should be identical except for the prime 2 (the conjecture is mentioned at the end of a survey article "Topology of Lie Groups and Characteristic Classes " by A. Borel, <i>Bulletin AMS</i> (mid 1950s). This striking conjecture led many topologists to attempt a proof, but without success, until in the first paper above I provided a very short and simple-minded proof using Symmetric space concepts, at the same time going beyond the conjecture and including SU(n). Even after this proof, other topologists tried doing it again with their own methods, but still unsuccessfully. The second paper above brings in suspension and further symmetric spaces. Incidentally, Bott periodicity itself is given a very short and simple proof in my later paper, "Bott periodicity via Simplicial Spaces," <i>Journal of Algebra</i> (1980): If U is the infinite unitary group and BU its classifying space, the periodicity statement is that B(BU)=U. I show that this  fact is exactly the Spectral theorem of elementary linear algebra for unitary matrices.  Here is the <i>Math Reviews</i> review by Harold Hastings:  "The author gives a beautiful well-motivated proof of the complex Bott periodicity theorem using only two essential properties of the complex numbers (unitary matrices can be diagonalized; the Stiefel manifolds of k-frames in C^N are highly connected for large n), and the group completion theorem."                                         <br /><br />2. "K-Groups of Rings of Algebraic Integers" (with G.Segal), <i>Annals of Math</i>, vol. 101, 1975. The theorem here  gives a partial result on Quillen\'s higher K-groups of any ring of algebraic integers, in every odd dimension, namely a cyclic direct summand is constructed, but in certain cases its order is determined only up to a factor of 2 or 1/2. It turned out that Lichtenbaum conjectured at about the same time that this was the entire group (without the extra factor ambiguity). Later the complete result was more or less proved by several people, and in many of these papers the methods of this paper continued to be used. Even the ambiguous factor turned out to be necessary and has only recently been settled  by Weibel. The tools used in this paper include the Cebotarev density theorem and a simple transfer procedure from linear groups over a finite field to those over a ring of algebraic integers. Segal originally envisaged a greater use and development of the Transfer, but this only came to full fruition in his later work.                                                         <br /><br />3. "Harmonic Volumes," <i>Acta Mathematica</i>, Vol. 150 (1983), and "Homological versus Algebraic Equivalence in a Jacobian," <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</i>, Vol. 80 ((1983). The first paper uses Chen\'s Iterated Integrals on  Riemann surfaces to give an explicit formula for the Abel-Jacobi image of a certain cycle on the Jacobian (the image being in a higher intermediate Jacobian). Previously Griffiths had given a general theorem for the derivative with respect to parameters of the Abel-Jacobi images of cycles and so was able to show the existence in parametrized families of cycles with certain properties (homologous to zero but not algebraically equivalent to zero), but his method could not give explicit examples, e.g., defined over integers. The method of the first paper above can be used to give such explicit examples, in fact very simple ones that lend themselves to arithmetic computation (and such arithmetic computation was next done by S. Bloch and his students, C. Schoen and D. Zelinsky). The first paper also gives "generic" results in the sense of Griffiths for the cycle obtained from a Riemann surface in its Jacobian. Later results of Hain give further significance to this cycle for the moduli space of curves.  Here is the <i>Math Reviews</i> review by David Lieberman of the second paper: "The existence of cycles which are homologous to 0, but not algebraically equivalent to 0, was first shown (non-constuctively) by P. Griffiths (<i>Annals of Math</i>, 1969). In the present article the author produces the first explicit example of this phenomenon. If C denotes the degree 4 Fermat curve, J its Jacobian and C^- the \'inverse\' of C on J, then         X= C-(C^-) povides the example. To achieve this, the author gives formulae for calculating the Weil-Abel-Jacobi mapping, W, of X to the intermediate Jacobian of J and for checking that W(X) is not zero.  G. Ceresa (<i>Annals</i>, 1983) and the author (<i>Acta Math</i>, 150 (1983) have also shown for generic J, C that W(X) is non-zero, employing arguments in the spirit of Griffiths\'s earlier work."                               <br /><br />4."Height Pairings and the Heat Equation," <i>Topology</i>, Vol. 32, 1993, showed that the kernel of the Heat operator (on differential forms) on a compact Kahler manifold, and a related "linking kernel" were convenient for calculating height pairings of complex cycles. An analogous kernel on a real Riemannian manifold can be used for linking numbers of (real) cycles and further for defining a real-valued generalized linking number which reduces modulo the integers to the Abel-Jacobi image. This relation of the Archimedean Height pairing to the Heat Kernel aroused the interest of Lang and Jorgenson, and they included part of this paper in their survey article "The Ubiquitous Heat Kernel" (p.655-682 of <i>Mathematics Unlimited: 2001 and Beyond</i>, edited by B. Engquist and W. Schmid, Springer, 2001).                         <br /><br />5. Bin Wang\'s Ph.D. thesis (Brown, 1994) and further work with Bin Wang: Previous to Bin\'s work, the Archimedean height pairing (of complex cycles) required disjointness of the supports of the cycles. In a very original thesis, Bin Wang obtained a formula for the asymptotics of the height pairing as the cycles move in a 1-parameter family towards a position where they intersect - the leading term in the asymptotics involved as coeffient an integer which he showed to be a Chern number describing the intersection. (Previously Hain had used Hodge theory to obtain an integer coefficient but left its actual value unspecified.)  Barry Mazur then became interested in Bin Wang\'s result and formulated a conjectural "Incidence Divisor" on the Chow variety to describe pairs of cycles of "linking dimension" which intersect. Bin later proved these conjectures of Mazur and began applying the to important problems in Algebraic Geometry.             <br /><br />5. My book <i>Iterated Integrals and Cycles on Algebraic Manifolds</i> (<i>Nankai Tracts in Mathematics</i>, Vol. 7, World Scientific Publishing, 2004) describes some of the work in #3 and #4 (above) with further developments. The book is based on a course I gave at the Nankai Mathematical Institute during fall semester 2001. I will always be most grateful to Professor S.S. Chern for inviting me to give a lecture at the Nankai Conference in 2000 on the work of W.L. Chow and K.T. Chen, to give this course the following year, and to publish the monograph based on it.                                                <br /><br />6. Current work:  What may be called "Linking Integrals" occur in various parts of mathematics, ranging from arithmetic geometry to V. Arnold\'s work on "Asymptotic Linking" of streamlines in Fluid Mechanics (see the book <i>Topological Methods in Hydrodynamics</i>, by Arnold and Khesin, 1998), and I am exploring and trying to develop such ideas.'

S'Over the next several years I plan to continue existing collaborations and develop new collaborations with scientists studying biological and machine intelligence. Anticipating the specific research questions that will arise is di&#14;cult, but probability, statistics and computing will surely play important<br />roles. I expect neuroscience, information theory and computer vision to remain central to my work.<br /><br />Neuroscience<br /><br />Perception, cognition and behavior arise in part from the electrical signals among billions of neurons. The details of this process are still a mystery. Modern neurophysiological techniques permit the<br />simultaneous recording of the electrical activity of hundreds of individual neurons (and this number is quickly growing) or, more coarsely, the global activity of brain regions comprised of hundreds<br />of thousands of neurons. The high dimensionality of the resulting data sets, combined with the peculiarities of neural activity patterns, create challenging statistical issues. Methods for exploratory statistical analysis are crucial right now in neuroscience, and will probably remain crucial for years to come. This is not to say that statistical modeling is premature but rather, that models are typically used in an exploratory fashion. The conflux of rapidly changing technology, high-dimensional datasets, demand<br />for exploratory methods, and sustained scientific excitement (and funding) all combine to create a fertile environment for statistical creativity and novel methodology.<br /><br />Information theory<br /><br />Information theory provides a rigorous probabilistic setting for understanding the fundamental limits of digital coding and communication. Because of its tight connection to probability theory,<br />many results in probability and statistics can be interpreted from an information theoretic point of view. This new perspective has led to a variety of insights, such as the minimum description length<br />(MDL) approach to model selection and learning [1]. Information theoretic ideas and interpretations are becoming commonplace in several applied areas, such as the biological sciences. Typically these applications borrow ideas, like entropy, that are related to theoretical lossless compression. Theoretical lossy compression, on the other hand, is a much less developed field with few existing<br />connections to scientific applications. The rate-distortion function plays the role of the entropy and describes the optimal amount of achievable compression. Furthermore, practical lossy compression<br />lags far behind practical lossless compression in terms of approaching optimal compression performance. Closing this gap will likely require new mathematical and computational insights,<br />as will drawing tighter connections between lossy compression and scientific applications. (I am convinced such connections exist. For example, lossy compression (which attempts to preserve semantic content at the expense of precise detail) seems more analogous to biological learning and perception than does lossless compression (which must preserve every detail).<br /><br />Computer vision<br /><br />The gap between biological and machine vision is substantial. The technological impact of closing this gap and the potential benefits for society are quite profound. One place where this gap is<br />especially apparent is visual learning. A child can accurately learn a novel visual category (like "helicopter") with only a few examples (maybe only a single example). But a visual category is an<br />incredibly complicated, high-dimensional statistical object (think of the collection of retinal images that contain a helicopter). How is rapid learning possible? Knowledge sharing (or transfer) among visual categories is often suggested as a possible solution. Inheriting ideas from my PhD advisor, Stuart Geman, I believe that highly structured statistical models (in particular, compositional models) are required for efficient sharing and transfer of knowledge. In any event, visual category learning represents an incredibly difficult statistical problem for which we know a solution exists. Even partial progress will push the boundaries of statistical methodology, generate new technology and provide scienti&#12;c insights into biological<br />vision.'

S"Dr. Hart's research has focused primarily on neurodegenerative disease and neuronal signaling using the C. elegans nervous system. Currently, she and her lab members are working on 1) Spinal Muscular Atrophy and on 2) Notch signaling in behavior, development, and stress response.<br /><br />Dr. Hart uses forward and reverse genetic techniques to identify pathways critical for neurodegenerative disease and has established the utility of C. elegans for modeling these human disorders. In the last few years, her laboratory has primarily focused on delineating the cellular and molecular pathways that play critical roles in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) as part of a collaborative effort with Drs. S. Artavanis-Tsakonas and D. van Vactor. Having multiple C. elegans models of neurodegenerative disease on hand allows both intellectual and practical synergy in characterizing relevant pathological pathways. Dr. Hart's group is currently developing C. elegans models of other neurodegenerative diseases.<br /><br />     Dr. Hart and her laboratory also undertake behavioral, molecular, and genetic studies to understand how animals respond to changes in the environment. This resulted in the identification of a new family of conserved Notch co-ligands in C. elegans. Current research examines 1) the role of these Notch co-ligands in cell fate specification during development, 2) the role of the Notch pathway in stress resistance/longevity, and 3) the targets of Notch signaling in adult behavior. Dr. Hart's laboratory has demonstrated that OSM-11 and related proteins act as Notch co-ligands in vivo. They are now undertaking additional developmental analyses and biochemical validation of this model in vivo and in tissue culture studies.  Loss of OSM-11 increases the resistance of C. elegans to osmotic stress. This has lead the laboratory to examine the role of the Notch pathway in stress resistance and longevity in an on-going collaboration with Dr. D. Sinclair.  <br /><br />Dr. Hart's group originally identified OSM-11 as a protein required for normal adult behavior and they are now addressing neuronal roles for the Notch signaling pathway. The role of Notch signaling in the adult nervous system is poorly understood in any system. Highlights of these on-going studies include identification of a role for Notch signaling in sensory response and in quiescence, a C. elegans model of sleep."

S"Worldwide, most adults with HIV have been infected through sexual exposure to HIV-infected seminal fluid or cervicovaginal secretions. In addition, most perinatal HIV transmission occurs following exposure to infected maternal cervicovaginal secretions. Several studies have shown that antiretroviral therapy can decrease HIV-1 RNA levels in the female genital tract. Studies have also shown a good correlation between blood plasma viral load and male and female genital tract viral load. It is postulated that reducing genital tract HIV-1 viral load should lead to reductions in sexual and mother to child HIV transmission.<br />Several factors have been associated with genital tract HIV-1 shedding. From these studies, the strongest indicators of genital tract HIV-1 shedding include plasma HIV-1 RNA level, CD4 cell count, and genital tract infection. However, studies evaluating the factors associated with HIV-1 shedding among women in resource-poor setting who are often taking generic antiretroviral therapy are lacking. Plasma HIV RNA level is closely related to long-term survival and disease progression. Plasma HIV RNA however, is not always predictive of tissue-specific HIV activity and disease, and HIV replication may in fact be compartmentalized. Several studies have noted that genital tract HIV-1 RNA may be genotypically distinct from or present in higher copy numbers than that found in plasma. These data show that assessment of plasma HIV RNA, while important prognostically, may not be representative of the virus' activity in other body compartments. This is important when sexual and vertical exposures account for the majority of new infections, and our understanding of the biology of HIV in the genital tract is not well understood.<br />Several factors have been shown to be associated with genital tract HIV shedding, including contraceptive pill use, genital infections, cervical ectopy, and pregnancy. One study of genital tract infections in Nairobi, Kenya found that HIV infected women diagnosed with acute gonococcal cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease experienced a significant rise in plasma HIV RNA level and a fall in CD4 cell counts at the time of infection. Viral RNA levels and CD4 cell counts returned to normal following treatment of STDs. This is important, because it suggests that aggressive screening and treatment of genital infections may alter the natural history of HIV infection by maintaining lower viral loads and preserving immune function.<br /><br />We are interested in understanding the determinants of sexual and mother to child HIV transmission and to identifying ways to intervene to help prevent this transmission. One way we are doing this is through the study of cervicovaginal HIV RNA levels, particularly among women receiving antiretroviral therapy. Because the bulk of HIV infections occur outside of the United States, we have been developing programs to study these factors in clinical settings where HIV is highly endemic. In addition, to improve the quality of the care delivered, we have been studying some of the basic epidemiology of HIV-infected populations in these settings, including the spectrum of opportunistic infections and barriers to care."

S'My research draws on principles from different individual disciplines, bringing a novel set of skills to the challenge of understanding the impacts humans have had on the composition of the atmosphere, the biosphere and climate. My research is driven by questions such as: what is the impact of anthropogenic emissions on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere? What are the current impacts of acid deposition on streams, lakes, and the terrestrial biosphere? How has the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen changed through time? What are the connections and feedbacks between the air quality, the physical climate system, and the health of the biosphere? To address these questions, I am currently utilizing novel isotopic measurement and modeling studies in the present environment, as well as characterizing how the environment has changed though time based on the interpretation of ice core measurements. <br /><br />My recent focus has been on the reactive nitrogen cycle, with emphasis on nitrate deposition. Nitrate deposition in rain, snow, ice and aerosols is the main sink of reactive nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the atmosphere. My interest in NOx extends from its connection to the oxidizing efficiency of the atmosphere through its impact on ozone and hydroxy (OH) concentrations to the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in the earth system via formation of nitric acid (or nitrate), a major component of acid rain and a source of biologically available nitrogen. Using the isotopic composition of nitrate, I am investigating variations in the sources, chemistry, and transport of NOx. On short time scales, this has implications for studying air quality and acid deposition impacts. On longer time scales, I am interested in the natural variability of NOx sources, and the connection between climate, atmospheric composition, and the biosphere.<br /><br />Because humans have significantly altered the biogeochemistry of nitrogen in the recent past, I am especially interested in exploring this cycle in the modern environment. The isotopic composition of nitrate represents an exciting new tool that can be used to characterize anthropogenic versus natural sources of nitrate, as well as the oxidant composition of the atmosphere.'

S'The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) mediates synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, in peripheral autonomic ganglia, and in the central nervous system. The nAChR belongs to a super-family of ligand-gated channels which include the glycine and GABA-A receptors. In the case of the nAChR, receptor activation occurs after binding of the physiological agonist, acetylcholine (ACh), to the receptor complex leading to the transient formation of a cation-selective channel. Antagonists with relative specificity for the nAChR include tubocurarine and the snake venom-derived neurotoxins such as alpha-bungarotoxin (BGTX) and alpha-cobratoxin. Our major interest is in determining the molecular and structural basis for the specificity of drug-receptor interactions. To accomplish this we are carrying out protein and peptide biophysical studies of receptor fragments. These studies include determining the solution structure of toxin-receptor fragment complexes using modern multidimensional NMR spectroscopic techniques. We also are applying molecular biological approaches to this problem by using heterologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis of both receptor and toxin residues in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship in this system. Both approaches are complementary and will facilitate the complete structural determination of the ligand binding site in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Such information could provide the basis for the rational design of drugs selective for such sites.<br /><br />More recent efforts are directed to exploiting the binding determinants responsible for BGTX action by transplanting these into other subunits normally insensitive to BGTX.&#160; We have termed the peptide sequence with this property a "pharmatope".&#160; We find that in some cases BGTX binding to such a pharmatope produces functional blockade of receptor action through an allosteric as opposed to a competitive mechanism.&#160; One further advantage to a pharmatope-tagged receptor subunit is that the many commercially available derivates of BGTX can now be used to label and functionally inhibit receptor complexes containing the tagged subunit.&#160; We are now pushing this approach to the organismic level by preparing a mouse using the homologous recombination technique (i.e., knock-in) in which the alpha3 gene is replaced by one containing a five amino substitution rendering the mutant subunit sensitive to BGTX, whereas the wild-type alpha3 is completely insensitive to BGTX.&#160; This mouse was the pioneer mouse generated in the Brown University Transgenic Facility in collaboration with Dr. Jan Klysik.&#160; The heterozygous mice are completely normal and breed well.&#160; We are currently assessing the functional sensitivity of the neuronal nicotinic receptors in the peripheral ganglia from these knock-in mice.&#160; The aim here is to use these mice to explore the physiological function of the alpha3 subunit in the central nervous system utilizing a standard pharmacological dissection approach.<br /><br />Many drugs&#151;both those that are therapeutically useful and those that are not&#151;physically interact with receptor proteins found on the cell surface of neurons and other excitable tissue. I am interested in determining the molecular and structural basis for the remarkable specificity of drug-receptor interactions in the brain. In particular, I am interested in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which mediates synaptic transmission at the junction between motor nerves and skeletal muscle. The function of the neuromuscular junction can be completely blocked by alpha-neurotoxins derived from snake venom that work by binding to the receptor. The specificity and potency of the alpha-neurotoxins found in snake venom are so great that they represent an ideal toward which drug developers and medicinal chemists strive. The ideal is a drug extremely active at low concentrations that does not interact with irrelevant receptors, thus reducing the likelihood of side effects. Working toward that ideal, and to increase our understanding of how receptors work, I am pursuing a number of biophysical studies with other researchers involving receptor fragments. With more detailed structural information describing the toxin-receptor interface, it should be possible for us to engineer the toxin by mutagenesis so as to alter its specificity.<br /><br />I became interested in this line of research as a result of my interests in chemistry and in the functioning of the brain. Both of these areas of interest were satisfied by studies of drugs and toxins and their interactions with receptors important for brain and nervous system function.'

We also study the molecular basis for the highly specific recognition of muscle-type nAChRs by certain snake venom-derived toxins classified as alpha-neurotoxins. More recently, we have used homologous recombination techniques to construct a knock-in mouse in which the alpha3 gene encoding one subtype of neuronal nAChRs has been minimally mutated to impart pharmacological sensitivity to the classic nicotinic antagonist, alpha-bungarotoxin.  These mice should enable a systematic determination of the role of alpha3-containing nAChRs in behavior and nervous system function.'

S"Research in progress relates both to 1) understanding the fundamental physical aspects of geological processes operating on the planets and satellites and, 2) the application of this knowledge to deconvolving the complex signal of the history of the planet contained in the geological record. <br /><br />Recently, specific emphasis has been placed on the following areas:<br /><br /><b>1) Volcanism and the Earth's seafloor as a planetary environment:</b> Theoretical modeling of the ascent and eruption of magma in the high-pressure deep seafloor environment (equivalent to that of Venus) and understanding the transition to shallower submarine and subaerial volcanism; analysis of basic theory and comparison to images and topographic data obtained on oceanic cruises and deep submersible dives.<br /><br /><b>2) Interpretation of the tectonics of Venus and implications for Earth:</b> Documentation of the geological history of Venus and its tectonic and volcanic processes, assessment of possible catastrophic and episodic volcanic and tectonic activity, and analysis of implications for the formation of continents on Earth and the processes that might have initiated plate tectonics on our own planet.  <br /><br /><b>3) Crustal formation and evolution on one-plate planets:</b> How do crusts form and evolve? Analysis of secondary and tertiary crust  on Mars, Venus and the Earth's Moon and assessment of implications for Mercury and early Earth.<br /><br /><b>4) Volcanism and tectonics on outer planet satellites:</b>  Analysis of the characteristics and history of the Galilean satellites, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto with emphasis on volcanic and tectonic processes and comparative geological and thermal histories of these satellites.  Application of this knowledge to other outer planet satellites.<br /><br /><b>5) Geological evolution of Mars:</b> What are the major factors in the geological evolution of Mars, and how does Mars differ from the other terrestrial planetary bodies?  What role does volcanism play in the resurfacing of the planet and in crustal formation and evolution?  How does volcanism create shallow crustal situations (e.g., dike emplacement, heating, melting of ground ice) that might be conducive to the production of environments favorable to life?  Where might these sites be located on Mars?  How do volcanic processes interact with subsurface water, the cryosphere, and surface glacial and volatile-rich deposits?<br /><br /><b>6) The History of Water on Mars:</b> What is the nature of the martian hydrological cycle and how has it changed with time?  What is the evidence for the presence of large standing bodies of water in the history of Mars and what was the fate of any such water? What is the nature of the cryosphere and how has it changed with time?  What is the history of the water table?  How is the history of water linked to environments conducive to life?<br /><br /><b>7) Climate Change on Earth and Mars:</b> What is the recent and ancient history of the polar caps? Is there evidence for glaciation?  How do these compare with examination of terrestrial glacial environments in Iceland and to the Antarctic Dry Valleys?  What is the evidence for migration and deposition of ice on Mars and how does the record of the Antarctic Dry Valleys inform us of this?  What is the significance of tropical mountain glaciers on Mars and how do they relate to recent ice ages there?"

S'Professor Heck works on various aspects of Frege\'s philosophy. His first project concerned the question what, precisely, Frege proves in the little-read formal sections of <i>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</i>. He has also written extensively on Frege\'s philosophy of logic, in particular on the question how we should understand Part I of <i>Grundgesetze</i>, in which, as Heck and others have noted, Frege develops a semantic theory for his formal language and attempts to prove that theory\'s adequacy. His forthcoming book <i>Reading Frege\'s Grundgesetze</i> will cover these topics. <br /><br />More recently, Heck has been working on how Frege\'s characteristic semantic doctrines develop. He has written four papers on this subject with Robert May, of the University of California at Davis.<br /><br />Professor Heck has also worked on technical problems connected to so-called neo-Fregean foundations for arithmetic. In 1996, Heck published a proof of the consistency of the predicative fragment of Frege\'s formal theory. That paper inspired a good deal of additional research by several people, which has recently been summarized in John Burgess\'s <i>Fixing Frege</i>. In addition, Heck has also recently closed one of the few outstanding mathematical questions by proving that Frege\'s proofs of the axioms of arithmetic go through, with some changes, in ramified second-order logic plus a single axiom known as HP, induction being the sole exception. His book <i>Frege\'s Theorem</i> collects many of his papers on these topics.<br /><br />Professor Heck\'s work in philosophy of language proceeds along two lines. His earliest papers in the area were concerned with defending Frege\'s claim that proper names and other referring expressions have "sense" as well as "reference." More recently, he has been arguing that we cannot properly understand human linguistic behavior, even from a "philosophical" point of view, without attributing semantic knowledge to speakers. Heck regards that project as nearly complete and is working on a book based on several papers that recently have been or shortly will be published.<br /><br />In philosophy of logic, Heck has worked primarily on truth. He has a lengthy technical study of axiomatic truth-theories formulated over weak base theories in progress.<br /><br />Finally, Professor Heck dabbles in philosophy of mind. He has published two papers on the question whether perceptual content is \'non-conceptual\' and has worked on the question whether the contents of beliefs are intensional.'

S"My research is currently focused on investigating the differential effects of aging and neurological disease on semantic memory, attention, and sensory integration using a variety of methodological approaches including cognitive neuropsychology, electrophysiology (EEG), and functional brain imaging (fMRI).  In addition to studying patient populations as model systems for understanding the neural substrates mediating normal cognitive function, my research is also concerned with the development of novel neurocognitive markers and therapeutic approaches for detecting and treating Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.<br /><br />Some of my current research projects are:<br /><br />&#9679; Investigations of the Perceptual Basis of Semantic Memory<br /><br />A view of semantic memory as grounded in perception has emerged, based mainly on recent neuroimaging (i.e., fMRI) evidence that retrieval from semantic memory activates unimodal perceptual cortex. Current studies in my lab are investigating this issue through complementary high-temporal resolution behavioral and electrophysiological measures of online semantic processing.  Results from these studies are generally supportive of a distributed perceptual-feature model of semantic memory. <br /><br />&#9679;  Neuropsychological Substrates underlying Category Learning<br /><br />There are several lines of evidence to suggest that categorical information about objects can be acquired either through an explicit system that mediates the use of conscious strategies to categorize stimuli or through an implicit system that mediates unconscious categorization. However, the defining features of these different systems as well as the conditions under which they may interact and contribute to category learning remain unresolved.  Research in my lab addresses this issue by: 1) exploring the conditions under which explicit and implicit category learning systems are recruited in normal populations; and 2) examining patterns of category learning performance in patient populations with specific neurological damage to on or the other system mediating category learning.<br /><br />&#9679;  Arousal, Attention and Semantic Processing in Alzheimer's Disease<br /><br />Alzheimer patients' semantic processing impairments in general, and their semantic priming impairments in particular, may be attributable to several distinct factors, including: a) the presence of an actual disruption of semantic memory due to damage to neocortical association areas; b) the presence of selective attentional deficits due to damage within superior parietal regions; and c) the presence of modulatory deficits due to damage within the noradrenergic and cholinergic ascending projection systems.   We are currently looking at these different possibilities using a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological techniques that systematically examine how changes in attentional systems influence semantic memory processes in Alzheimer patients.<br /><br />&#9679; Feature Integration and Attention in Alzheimer's Disease<br /><br />We are looking at the relationship between object representation and visual attention in Alzheimer patients.   Although some recent studies suggest that Alzheimer patients possess specific object-based attentional deficits, the disruption of corticocortical connections within higher-order association areas in these patients may also produce impairments in integrating visual information into coherent object representations. Thus, the apparent deficits on tests of visual attention exhibited by Alzheimer patients may be influenced as much by impairments in object representation as by impairments in attention.  Identification of the ways in which object representation and attentional processes interact in Alzheimer's disease should not only provide a better understanding of the cognitive deficits associated with this disease, but should also lead to important information about the neuropsychological substrates mediating normal object perception and attention.<br /><br />&#9679; Interactions between Hippocampal and Striatal Memory Systems in ADHD<br /><br />Although the neuroanatomical underpinnings of ADHD are beginning to be identified, this emerging anatomical model has yet to be integrated with a model of cognitive dysfunction in ADHD.  What is critically needed at this time is the development of a coherent conceptual framework for understanding how dysfunction in specific brain networks translates into disordered information processing and thereby into the impulsive and hyperactive behaviors characteristic of ADHD.  A potentially fruitful, and as yet unexplored, approach is to view the neuropsychological manifestations of ADHD in terms of interactions between hipppocampal and striatal memory systems. While previous studies in both humans and animals have been successful in identifying and isolating distinct brain systems underlying different forms of memory, relatively few studies have addressed how these distinct learning mechanisms interact to produce coordinated behavioral adaptation to the environment.  For example, information acquired through one memory system may either complement or interfere with information acquired through the other memory system, depending on the particular demands of the learning task.  Children with ADHD may provide an ideal population to investigate the nature of interactions between distinct memory systems, since unlike other neurological disorders with specific dysfunction within either the hippocampal (e.g., amnesics) or striatal (e.g., Huntington's or Parkinson's disease) memory system, ADHD may best be characterized as a disruption in the normal balance in the activation and utilization of these two learning mechanisms."

S"Determining the molecular genetic underpinnings of the process of aging promises to be one of the next great frontiers in biomedical science. Despite our understanding of many of the intricacies of how a single fertilized egg develops into a mature individual, up until recently, we knew very little about the mechanisms by which we age--a subject of great scientific interest for several millennia.  We are interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development, maturation, and aging of adult animals using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model system.  In our laboratory we make use of a combination of molecular, genetic, cellular, neurobiological, pharmacological, immunological, and behavioral approaches to understand the process of aging and how life span is determined.  By combining the powerful molecular genetic techniques available in the Drosophila melanogaster with knowledge of the fly's physiology, anatomy, behavior, and life span altering interventions, we have helped develop an unparalleled model for studying the molecular genetic elements of aging.<br /><br />We discovered that mutations that decrease the activity of a single gene, Indy (I'm not dead yet), dramatically extends life span in flies without reducing reproduction, physical activity, or metabolic rate.  The function of the Indy protein as a transporter of Krebs cycle intermediates and its localization to regions of the fly important in uptake, utilization and storage of nutrients, suggest that reductions in the level of Indy protein alters the metabolic state of the fly in a way that favors life span extension.  We are studying how mutations in Indy extend life span in Drosophila and whether manipulation of Indy-like gene activity in mammals will extend healthy lifespan in mammals.<br /><br />A reduction in Indy activity induces the fly to assume a physiological state similar to calorie restriction, an intervention known to extend life span in mammals, invertebrates, and yeast.  But how does calorie restriction extend life span? We have shown that the histone deacetylatase enzymes Rpd3 and Sir2, known to deacetylate histone proteins as well as other proteins such as p53, are responsible for mediating the life span extending effect of calorie restriction in the fly.  The conservation of the calorie restriction pathway and the role of Rpd3 and Sir2 in mediating life span extension in a variety of organisms (yeast, nematode, fly) indicate that knowledge of this biochemical/genetic pathway should assist in the development of genetic and pharmacological interventions for the extension of life span.  In collaboration with Marc Tatar at Brown University and David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School, we used this knowledge to show that small compounds that enhance Sir2 activity, such as resveratrol, extend the life span in nematodes and flies through a Sir2 dependent calorie restriction pathway. We are continuing to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Rpd3 and Sir2 cause life span extension starting with studies on p53, the well-known tumor suppressor protein that is inactivated by Sir2.  Mice with hyperactive p53 activity are resistant to tumor formation, but surprisingly have a shortened life span with signs of premature aging.  Our recent results indicate reduction of p53 activity is one of the mediators of the Sir2/calorie restriction life span extending pathway in flies.<br /><br />Our studies have led to the proposal of a genetic/biochemical pathway for the life span extending effects of calorie restriction.  Mutations in Indy or other triggers that similarly alter the metabolic state of the fly decrease Rpd3 activity, increase Sir2 activity, reduce p53 activity, and extend life span.  Our success in predicting the life span extending effect on flies of the Sir2 activator resveratrol suggest that knowledge of this pathway will be valuable for identifying additional interventions for extending life span in flies and other species, including humans.<br /><br />Projects in the laboratory include: (i) the use of a newly developed rapid method for identifying genes and drugs that slow aging and extend life span; (ii) determining at a biochemical and whole animal physiological level how the single gene mutation, Indy, causes a near doubling of the life span of the fly without a significant tradeoff in physiological functioning; (iii) development of a biochemical/genetic pathway for the life span extending affect of calorie restriction, which includes delineating how alterations in the histone deacetylases rpd3 and Sir2 and sirtuin activator, resveratrol, mediate life span extension; (iv) developing modifications in metabolic activity through transgenic approaches that alter mitochondrial uncoupling and extend healthy life span; (v) defining the role of the well known tumor suppressor p53 in the life span determination; (vi) and the development of the fly as a model for studying disorders of human aging such as neurodegeneration, obesity, and diabetes."

S'How is high-level auditory information about our environment organized? There is a strong theoretical basis for connecting auditory perception with events rather than objects. It is a "tree falling in the forest" that is heard, not just the tree. Sound is generated by the physical interactions of objects, surfaces, and substances &#150; in other words, events. The sound waveform contains a great deal of potential information about its sources properties. However, no single acoustic feature specifies a particular object or action. Information about sound sources is complex and time-varying, and it is not known to what degree or in what form it is exploited by human listeners. My research examines the human ability to understand what events are happening in the environment through sound. Perceptual experiments address whether there are auditory prototypes (or central exemplars) that represent different event attributes, whether those prototypes can be used to predict psychological phenomena such as a preference for exaggeration or the ability to recognize caricatures, and whether audition plays a significant role in the perception of multi-modal events. This basic research will relate psychological performance to acoustic properties and high-level auditory information.The results of this research may have the potential to enhance processing for hearing aids and improve auditory displays, both for virtual reality and for visually impaired computer users. I believe that immersive and interactive human/machine interfaces of the future will need to make advances in auditory interfaces as well as addressing the interaction between audition and vision.'

S'Most of my current research centers on reconstructing two vital aspects of the past surface ocean: the distribution of temperatures and patterns of biological production. The ocean holds nearly all the heat at the surface of our planet, and therefore plays a crucial role in determining past global and regional temperatures. In addition, conditions in the ocean drive the cycle of water vapor in the atmosphere, and this cycle very much depends on ocean surface temperatures. The surface ocean also exchanges large quantities of CO <sub>2</sub> with the atmosphere. The net transfer of carbon into or out of the atmosphere depends on both the surface temperature of the ocean and on carbon synthesis in the upper ocean by plankton. Plankton activity in turn responds in a complex way to climate change; we do not yet understand how these feedbacks work between global climate, carbon cycle changes, and paleoecological changes in the ocean.<br /><br />Some of the exciting areas that my group is now investigating include high-resolution oceanographic reconstructions (decadal to century-scale) in the El Nino-dominated regions off the Peru and California coasts, and the evolution high and low latitude climate linkages as the Earth has moved from a warm state in the Pliocene (3-5 Ma) to its present heavily glaciated state. <br /><br />The principal tools for my work include:<br /><ul><br /><li> Alkenone paleotemperature determinations </li><br /><li> Alkenone and other biomarker determinations for estimating past ocean productivity </li><br /><li> Sediment Nitrogen isotope analyses for estimating the past intensity of oceanic anoxic zones (in collaboration with Mark Altabet, UMass Dartmouth) </li><br /><li> Oxygen isotope stratigraphy </li><br /><li> Non-destructive methods of sediment core analysis </li><br /><li> Time series analysis for extracting cyclic patterns from sediment data in order to develop paleoclimatic models </li><br /></ul>'

S"My major research thesis examines that the Moon and probably all the terrestrial planets underwent an initial differentiation from largely a completely molten state. The resulting cumulate products were gravitationally unstable, resulting in an additional solid state differentiation that reintroduced heat producing elements deep within the planets but also created a heterogeneous mantle with characteristic depletions in the highly incompatible elements. The latter is recorded in the isotopic systematics of basalts derived throughout geological history.<br /><br />The Moon, being the smallest planet, has preserved the stamp of the early differentiation because the vigor of thermal convection from a rapidly cooled planet was insufficient to rehomogenize the heterogeneous mantle. In contrast, the heterogeneities, particularly the isotopic anomalies, are more muted on the earth, presumably because plate tectonics as driven by the instabilities of the thermal boundary layers has effectively erased most, but not all evidence of the magma ocean.<br /><br />Interestingly, the isotopic composition of ancient and young Martian magmas make it appear that Mars is more like the Moon than the earth. The extraordinary heterogeneity is persevered in both young and old mantle; this fact coupled with the very old crust indicates that magma ocean processes followed by mantle overturn produced a compositionally heterogeneous but gravitational stable mantle operated at the very earliest epochs. The live 182W and 142 Sm anomalies show that this event characterized the first 50 million years of Mars history (Hess and Parmentier, 2001). These ideas, if verified, will significantly reshape our ideas about the primordial evolution of the terrestrial planets.<br /><br />Other topics of interest deal with the thermodynamic properties of thin liquid films at grain boundaries in large and nanoscale crystals. The results have application to the distribution and permeability of silicate melts in the earth's mantle and the stability of water/ice in permafrost in terrestrial or Martian environments (Hess and Longhi, 2001). Interestingly, the melt-crystal phase boundary can be depressed to significantly lower temperatures in thin films and crystal-liquid partition coefficients in thin and bulk films can be radically different."

S"CENTRAL RESEARCH INTERESTS<br /><br />A unifying topic of my research activities has been the development, analysis, and application of high-order accurate methods for the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations with a particular emphasis on conservation laws. The majority of my research efforts are centered around classic areas of the numerical analysis of such methods, i.e., problems associated with accuracy, stability, efficient solvers, robustness etc, as well as large scale applications of such methods.<br /><br />Until a few years ago, the use of high-order methods was restricted to a small community due to number of problems which have found robust solutions only in the last decade and in the development of which I have been involved. As evidence of the recent rapidly expanding interest in such techniques one can note that more than 250 people attended the last International Conference on Spectral and High-Order Methods (ICOSAHOM), co-organized by me and held at Brown in summer 2004. This is more than twice the attendance of the previous ICOSAHOM which took place in Uppsala in the summer of 2001.<br /><br />What separates high-order accurate methods from more classic computational techniques, e.g., finite element, finite volume, or finite difference methods, is the inherent assumption of global smoothness that allows one to very accurately approximate solutions using global expansions, i.e., Fourier series or high order polynomials are classical examples. This results in highly efficient computational methods for problems with smooth solutions and this was the original area where these methods were used, e.g., incompressible fluid flows. However, one easily shows that the benefits of using high-order methods become increases when one considers time dependent problems as they offer superior control over error growth.<br /><br />The classic concerns raised about the use of high-order and spectral methods are that the nature of the global expansion and the assumption of smoothness essentially restricts the use of such techniques to smooth problems in simple domains. Addressing these exact concerns has occupied me during the last decade and a number of techniques to overcome these restrictions have been developed.<br /><br />Geometric flexibility is most naturally ensured through a multi-domain ormulti-element formulation. However, this approach shifts the key question to how one develops and imposes proper patching conditions between the local solutions in a consistent, time stable manner, and computationallyefficient way for general conservation laws. The key developments here are found in the analysis of wellposedness of the PDE's at the continuous level to derive the correct boundary operators and the use weakly or asymptoticallyimposed boundary conditions, known as penalty methods in spectral methods,SAT methods in high-order finite difference methods and, as a very popularspecial case, discontinuous Galerkin methods. This results in fully general, discontinuous element methods on Galerkin or collocation method-of-lines form, well suited for general geometries, adaptivity, parallel implementations etc. Furthermore, the additional freedom recovered by relaxing the boundary conditions enables a constructive approach to stability, and the fundamental separation between the interior operators and the boundary operators offers exciting new opportunities to develop preconditioning<br />techniques etc<br /><br />In a number of papers, I have, with several co-authors, developed these techniques from a very basic initial idea in the late 1980'es to mature computational techniques for a variety of problems, e.g., compressible Navier-Stokes equations, Maxwell's equations etc, and analyzed such schemes for stability as well as accuracy. This has lead to schemes which have full geometric flexibility, a substantial stability theory, and with several examples of implementations. More importantly, they allow for the use methods at arbitrary order, thus enabling the choice of order best suited to solve a particular problem at a given tolerance in minimum time. In several papers we show how to make this trade off in the most appropriate way.<br /><br />While the early developments of these techniques were centered around the use of curvilinear hexahedra as the main geometric building block, such methods are somewhat restricted by the difficulty associated with automatic grid generation based on hexahedra.<br /><br />Thus, early on I began looking at computationally efficient high-order accurate ways of representing solutions efficiently on general element types, in particular simplexes. This lead to the development of high-order nodal elements based on genuine multivariate Lagrange polynomials in which the associated grid points are computed as a minimum energy solution to an electrostatic problem. With further developments, this has led to the formulation of high-order accurate families of computational methods for general conservation laws, discretized on fully unstructured grids. During the last few years we have demonstrated the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of methods for variety of problems, e.g., gas- and fluid flows, electromagnetics, and free surface flows.<br /><br />The development and analysis of high-order methods for solving conservation laws in complex geometries continues to occupy a cornerstone in my research efforts. However, in more recent papers I have also considered in some depth the questions of how to use high-order methods for problems of limited regularity. The standard technique here, both for stabilization and accuracy recovery, is that of filtering and we have recently offered the first thorough analysis of this for polynomial methods. Another technique which we have recently considered is postprocessing and filtering by Pade reconstruction.<br /><br />Along side these main activities, I have been involved in a variety of related efforts over the last decade. In particular, I have spend considerable effort on the analysis and further development of novel absorbing layers, known as perfectly matched layers, to accurately model problems in open domains. This has led to new methods for both advective acoustics and electromagnetics.<br /><br />Another interesting development is that of embedded finite difference methods, e.g., methods where one locally alters the stencil to enable the use of simple grids even for geometrically complex problems. The key concern here is how to accomplish this in a time stable manner and to the order of the interior scheme. In a few papers, we demonstrated how to accomplish this for Maxwell's equations in a 2nd order scheme, offering the first stability analysis of such methods. Recent work also includes attention to 4th order schemes although a general multi-dimensional approach for this remains an open challenge.<br /><br />Yet another activity is that of adaptivity and error estimation for dynamic problems. My work here has focused on the use of wavelets to provide reliable local error and smoothness estimators on which one can subsequently decide how do adapt the grid and/or the local order of the method. These methods appear promising although we are currently exploring alternatives also, e.g., adjoint based estimation.<br /><br />A glance at my CV will reveal that the research activity discussed in the above are the main ones but just a subset of activities. Further details can be found in the papers listed in my CV.<br /><br /><br />TYPICAL APPLICATION AREAS<br /><br />A quick glance at most of my papers will reveal that the are often composed in the same way -- a problem is stated, often driven by a particular class of applications, a solution is proposed and analyzed and the method is implemented and tested extensively, often on nontrivial benchmarks.<br /><br />This approach reflects that I strongly believe in the importance of demonstrating the usefulness of proposed methods for the applications originally motivating the work -- even if this requires substantial efforts in implementing and testing the algorithms.<br /><br />This also means that I, over the years, have been involved in a variety of application areas, e.g., geophysical flows, plasma physics, gas- and fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics etc. Lately, my main application area has been electromagnetics, mainly in the context of scattering and penetration into geometrically complex objects or the modeling of integrated/diffractive optics. Both areas are examples of applications where high-order methods excel, in the former case due to the size of a typical problem, e.g., an aircraft, and the need to propagate wave accurate over long distance, and in the latter case due to the inherent phase-sensitivity of such components.<br /><br />Currently, the main new directions of applications are found in kinetic plasma physics, used to model accelerator and microwave generators, and cosmology and numerical relativity, aimed at using high order methods to model binary black holes."

S'My 1991 book, <i>Sensations</i> (Cambridge University Press) defends a metaphysical theory of consciousness that identifies conscious experiences with high level brain states. My 2002 book, <i>Thought and World</i> (Cambridge University Press) defends a deflationary theory of truth, reference, and semantic correspondence. According to this theory, these semantic concepts can all be defined in terms of substitutional quantification. My current research in philosophy of mind is concerned with representational theories of qualia and with the representational contents of perceptual experiences. I am also working on a project in philosophy of language, the goal of which is to defend conceptual role semantics from the Quine/Fodor objection that there is no principled basis for distinguishing those aspects of conceptual role that are constitutive of meaning from other aspects.'

S'Both animal and human studies suggest that impaired in utero and postnatal growth can affect gonadal size and function into adulthood  thus  affecting reproductive outcome.  To study genetic factors that influence susceptibility, we study the Akt gene family which is important in cell growth, metabolism, and survival.  Akt1-deficient mice are born small for gestational age and are more susceptible to reproductive toxicants.  Thus, we hypothesize that the Akt gene family plays critical roles in gonadal development and sensitivity to reproductive toxicants. Studies in our laboratory  indicate that when the PI3K/Akt signaling network is targeted by environmental toxicants, it can result in adverse reproductive health outcomes in both the male and female reproductive system.'

S'Research in my laboratory is directed towards identifying the cellular targets of hepatocarcinogens and understanding the molecular events leading to the malignant conversion of hepatocytes and liver progenitor cells.  A long standing interest has been the role of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in liver regeneration and carcinogenesis.  We have restricted our investigations to two CAMs in the Ig super gene family:  CEACAM1 which is lost on liver carcinomas as well as carcinomas in the bladder, colon, and prostate;  Nectin-like protein 5 (Necl-5), a CAM that is not expressed by normal  resting hepatocytes but is dramatically upregulated following liver injury and is expressed constitutively at high levels  on hepatocellular carcinomas.  In the rat, there are two major splice variants of CEACAM1 designated CEACAM1-L (long) and CEACAM1-S (short) that differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domains.  The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-L, mediates signaling via the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its ITIM residues, signaling that suppresses the growth of tumor cells when expression is restored.   We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic domain is necessary and sufficient for tumor suppression, a finding we are trying to exploit for cancer therapy by developing a small peptide corresponding to the region of the 70 amino acid cytoplasmic domain determined to be necessary and sufficient for tumor suppression.  Although the short isoform does not display tumor-suppressor activity, it has been shown to play a role in glandular morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells.  In addition, we have found serendipitously that restoration of CEACAM1-S expression induces tumorigenicity in a non-tumorigenic clone derived from a rat hepatocellular carcinoma.  Current research is aimed at determining the role of two phosphorylation sites in the 10 amino acid CEACCAM1-S cytoplasmic domain in restoring tumorigenicity.  We are also examining the involvement in tumor suppression of three GXXXG dimerization motifs and two tyrosine residues in the transmembrane domain, the latter having been shown to be required for signaling mediated by surface IgM and several other signaling molecules.<br /><br />Another aspect of ongoing research is the identification of hepatic progenitor cells involved in liver regeneration and carcinogenesis.  Although there is compelling evidence for the presence of bipotent progenitor cells in the adult liver, the role of these progenitors in hepatocarcinogenesis is still a subject of debate.  Building on our past experience with cholangiocytes and oval cells, a bipotent biliary progenitor activated by most hepatocarcinogens, we have focused on identifying bipotent progenitors present in the biliary tree and ascertaining their role in hepato- and cholangio- carcinogenesis. Over the past 3 years, we have developed novel monoclonal antibody based isolation schemes for bipotent liver progenitors that persist in the newborn rat liver in relative high numbers.  We have examined the ability of fetal liver cholangiocytes, hepatoblasts, and non-parenchymal cells isolated from dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive rats to regenerate the liver of DPPIV-deficient host rats treated with retrorsine and partial hepatectomy (R/PH).  In this transplantation model, DPPIV serves as a marker for donor derived cells and retrorsine is used to compromise the ability of host liver cells to regenerate the liver after partial hepatectomy but has no effect on the regenerative response of transplanted liver cells. Results from transplantation of cholangiocyte marker positive fetal liver cells (CMP-FLEC) produced the unexpected finding that the capacity of CMP-FLEC for growth in the R/PH treated adult liver is much higher than that of fetal hepatoblasts and other nonparenchymal cell types.  In ongoing studies, we are using the retrorsine transplantation model to address the question of whether immature cholangiocyte marker positive newborn liver cells (CMP-NBLC) retain an ability to differentiate into hepatocytes and regenerate the liver of R/PH treated rats.  To assess the role of CMP-NBLC in hepatocarcinogenesis, we are employing a modified version of the resistant hepatocyte carcinogenesis protocol to test the hypothesis that neonatal treatment with diethylnitrosamine (DENA) generates initiated CMP-NBLC capable of progression to cholangiocyte marker positive hepatocellular carcinoma (CMP-HCC).  <br /><br />Another aspect of ongoing research is the delineation of changes in gene expression that are involved in the process of cholangiocarcinogenesis.  We have found that at high passage, bile duct epithelial cultures (BDEC) undergo spontaneous transformation, as evidenced by the formation in vivo of desmoplastic ductular adenocarcinomas, anchorage independent growth in vivo, and elevated expression of activated ErbB2 and COX-2. Growth on soft agar and tumor formation were also acquired by high passage but not by low passage anchorage dependent BDEC following stable transduction with an activated ErbB2 retrovirus, suggesting that ErbB2 was necessary but not sufficient for neoplastic transformation.  Functional genomic analysis with RNAi will be utilized in future studies to identify genes that cooperate with (high passage) or antagonize  (low passage) ErbB2 mediated spontaneous transformation of bile duct epithelial cells.  <br /><br />We have recently discovered that neoplastic progression of BDEC in vitro is closely associated with aneuploidy, a genetic abnormality appearing after as few as 30 passages.  Closely associated with the acquisition of  aneuploidy is the loss of a 170 kDa protein, designated BD.1, a cytoplasmic protein originally identified using hybridoma technology as an Monoclonal antibody (MAb) defined epitope expressed by cholangiocytes but not by oval cells,  stem-like liver cells that proliferate in response to a variety of carcinogens. We now have evidence that BD.1 is either identical to or complexed with one of two 170 kDa microtubule associated proteins, CLIP 170 and CLASP, a conclusion based on the down regulation of BD.1 during S phase and by co-precipitation and co-localization with CLIP 170.  Our current investigations are centered on determining the identify of BD.1 using mass spectrometry and on testing the hypothesis that the loss of BD.1 alters microtubule/kinetochore dynamics in a manner that promotes aneuploidy.   <br /><br />A long term goal of our liver progenitor research is to ascertain whether any of the lineage markers defined in the rat have human counterparts that can be used to isolate progenitor cells from human liver. Of the lineage markers we have identified to date, OC.10 is the only surface marker currently available that recognizes the cholangiocytes forming the nascent ductal structures in fetal rat liver.  MAb OC.10 has proven to be invaluable for isolating bipotent cholangiocytes from fetal and newborn rat liver. These valuable features provided a strong impetus to identify the protein bearing the epitope recognized by MAb OC.10. Using a variety of biochemical and immunochemical methods, we have determined that MAb OC.10 defines an epitope unique to a cell surface form of Hsc70 expressed by fetal, newborn, and adult cholangiocytes. Current efforts are focused on determining the structural basis for the selective reactivity of MAb OC.10 with Hsc70 on the surface of cholangiocytes but not with the cytoplasmic forms of Hsc70 expressed by hepatocytes.  The ultimate goal of this analysis is to establish a rationale basis for generating MAbs against the human cholangiocyte equivalent of OC.10. Most recently, we have shown by indirect immunofluorescence that the reactivity of affinity purified polyclonal anti Hsc70 antibodies is confined to the surface of both hepatocytes and bile ducts, suggesting that the surface forms of Hsc70 in rat liver carries both common (polyclonal anti Hsc70) and cell-type specific (MAb OC.10) epitopes.  In addition, we have preliminary data suggesting that the cell surface epitope recognized by MAb OC.10 is restricted to a small subset of CK19 positive ductules in human liver.  We are currently using confocal microscopy to obtain three dimensional reconstructions of these MAb OC.10 reactive ductules to determine if they have a morphology and localization consistent with the canals of Hering, a specificity that could be exploited for the isolation of bipotent cholangiocyte progenitors from human liver.'

S'Research in the Hoffman-Kim laboratory focuses on understanding axon guidance in complex environments and developing biomaterial and tissue engineering strategies for nerve guidance and repair. We apply engineering techniques to biological systems in vitro to challenge growing neurons with multiple guidance cues, including diffusible factors, substrate-bound molecules, electrical cues, and topographical surface features.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary: Axon Guidance by Permissive and Inhibitory Molecular Gradients</b><br />During development, correct guidance of growing axons is critical in order to establish the precise connections of the nervous system that are essential for proper brain function. Neurodevelopmental disorders that result from improper connections in the brain can lead to damaging disease states in humans. The interdisciplinary approaches of these studies, including microfluidics and chomophore-assisted laser inactivation, work toward a more quantitative understanding of axon growth decisions. We seek to assess how gradients of permissive and repulsive molecules guide axon decisions, giving particular attention to the complex situation of guidance by two contrasting molecules, a system that more closely approximates axon guidance conditions in vivo. We are testing the hypothesis that axons make growth decisions in multi-molecular gradients by integrating growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory factors&#151;including extracellular gradient parameters, receptors, and intracellular signaling pathways. This work, to advance a more complete comprehension of the mechanisms underlying axon navigation, is critical for elucidating the basis of improper brain development.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary: Axon Guidance by Multiple Cues</b><br />Nerves fail to regenerate after injury, and current medical practice is unable to manipulate effectively the process of nerve regeneration. This project seeks to solve this problem by quantifying how guidance cues, both individually and in combination, promote axon growth. This knowledge is central to understanding nerve development and promoting accurate and effective nerve regeneration. Our working hypothesis is that directed axon growth requires multiple cues, which must be well-defined and coordinated at the level of the local cellular environment. To test this hypothesis necessitates the fabrication of a new platform upon which to study neuronal growth. The platform (1) delivers a combination of cues in a controllable and quantifiable manner; and (2) provides a means by which to test their hierarchical and synergistic interactions. We are fabricating platforms with specific dimensions and spatial arrangements of multiple cues, to test how combinations of topographical and molecular guidance cues promote axon growth.  Our objective is to correlate axon growth and direction to specific quantities and ratios of cues, thus establishing the basis for new strategies for nerve regeneration.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary: Neurite Bridging Across Micro-Patterned Grooves</b><br />During development and after injury, growing axons must navigate complex, three-dimensional microenvironments. Topographic guidance of neurite outgrowth has been demonstrated in vitro with culture substrates that contain micropatterned features on the nanometer-micron scales. We are characterizing the ability of microfabricated biomaterials to support neurite extension across micropatterned grooves with feature sizes on the order of tens of microns, a size relevant to the design of biomaterials and tissue engineering scaffolds. Neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have been cultured on grooved substrates of poly(dimethyl siloxane) coated with poly-l-lysine and laminin. A subpopulation of DRG neurons displays an unusual capacity to extend neurites that span across the grooves, with no underlying solid support. Multiple parameters influence the formation of bridging neurites and underlying mechanisms are under investigation. These studies are of interest to understanding cytoskeletal dynamics and designing biomaterials for three-dimensional axon guidance.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary: Composite Biomaterials for Neurite Outgrowth in collaboration with Dr. Tayhas Palmore, Division of Engineering</b><br />Much of the previous research on biomaterial systems for nerve regeneration has examined the permissive capabilities of individual components or materials toward axon growth.  These studies seek to quantify how composite biomaterials guide axon growth, giving particular attention to the complex problem of guidance by more than one component.  Our working hypothesis is that composite biomaterials, presenting multiple growth-promoting cues, will enable axon growth to overcome a local environment that is inhibitory. Our long-term objective is twofold: to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie axon guidance during development and after injury, and to develop biomaterial platforms to support and enhance axon growth.  The important roles for glial cells, extracellular matrix molecules, and electrical stimulation in mediating axon growth have been established.  How they interact and how they can be used in combination to direct axon growth is not well understood, however. This work combines microfabrication, electrochemistry, and primary cell cultures to generate a composite biomaterial substrate that is electrically conductive, embedded with growth-promoting proteins, and adheres supportive glial cells.  Results from these studies will provide fundamental knowledge of how specific neural connections form during normal development and how they can be stimulated to regenerate following injury.<br /><br /><b>Project Summary: Nanoscale Biomimetic Materials for Nerve Regeneration</b><br />Successful nerve regeneration requires directed nerve growth. The goal of this project is to determine systematically the critical cues needed to guide nerves, thus providing essential information for new strategies for nerve regeneration. Dr. Diane Hoffman-Kim\'s group has developed a set of materials that are biomimetic and can replicate cellular shapes at the nanoscale. Significantly, the group can produce nanostructures "by design", where the design is motivated by and directly incorporates the biological structure. By systematically comparing Dr. Hoffman-Kim\'s biomimetic materials with the nanoscale, randomly patterned materials developed by the group of Dr. Thomas Webster, the team will elucidate the key pattern features required for nerve growth. By combining these materials with the cutting-edge drug delivery systems developed by the laboratory of Dr. Edith Mathiowitz, the research team will tailor materials to enhance nerve growth. In collaboration with Dr. Moses Goddard, a clinical and research surgeon, the team will evaluate the materials in vivo in a peripheral nerve injury model. This initial effort will ultimately result in an interdisciplinary research group with key areas of expertise that converge synergistically to develop and fabricate novel biomimetic biomaterial systems with drug delivery capabilities, to characterize these biomaterials in vitro, and to evaluate them in in vivo models of nerve injury, thus advancing work in the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and nanomedicine.'

My interests in the life course of American adolescents include educational attainments, finding secure employment, starting a family, and earning a living wage. I am particularly interested in the ways in which opportunities in local environments and resources of their parents are converted into the successful transition to adulthood. These influences are revealed in situations in which these transitions are limited for young people with health impairments or disabilities.<br /><br />More generally, I have focused on the health and disability of children and adolescents &#150; population prevalence, access and use of needed medical and supportive services, their educational and employment aspirations and experiences, and the effects of children with disabilities on the lives of other family members. Throughout my career I have been involved in studies of reproductive health and the well-being of mothers and children in developing county populations. My research interest in developing nations and on the lives of adolescents has resulted in a major on-going longitudinal study of young men and women in Ethiopia and current data collection and analysis with Palestinian researchers at Birzeit University, Ramallah. <br /><br />I teach the undergraduate courses: Perspectives on Societies, Populations in Danger, Race, Gender and Class, and Market Research. My graduate teaching involves seminars on sociological theory construction and research methods, and sociology of the life course, and demographic methods. I believe that the best way to teach sociology is through hands-on research experience in courses and seminars and through independent studies with undergraduate and graduate students.'

S"My overarching research interest is in the influence of the social and cultural environment on human development. Over the years, this interest led me to look at this dual process - internal psychological functioning and its cultural context - in a number of ways and in a number of places. The psychological processes I investigated include cognitive and linguistic development, social and moral development, the self in its cultural context, and adolescent identity formation. The focus on the social and cultural context most recently led me to examine those demographic processes which affect children's welfare and behavior. Specifically, I am looking at the manner in which fertility outcomes (the number of children a mother has) influence the context in which children grow up. One of the issues that I am examining is the concept of children in various cultural contexts and how this influences the way people treat children.<br /><br />In addition to the issues related to children, I am also interested in demographic processes, primarily fertility and marriage, that impact on women. For the past two decades my research has increasingly focused on the relationship between the status of women and fertility. I am currently examining how the power relationship between husbands and wives within marriage influences their communication about their desires to have more children and how this in turn determines their adoption of contraception.<br /><br />I have done work on these subjects in Eastern Europe (Hungary), East Africa (Tanzania) and West Africa (Nigeria).I have recently completed a book on a community in Hungary where I look at the town's history through the stories of several generations of three families, entitled <i>Scandal in a Small Town</i>. My most current research projects include: the examination of the lives of infertile women &#150; their difficulties and coping mechanisms &#150; in a Nigerian community; and a study of the conceptualization of children by families of different social groups in post-socialist Hungary.<br /><br />My teaching in the Anthropology Department is divided between my interests in psychological processes and in issues related to population, more specifically to issues of reproduction. I am a member of the Center for the Study of Human Development and of the Population Studies and Training Center."

S'Many current projects involve statistical methods for epigenetics, an exciting field of genome-wide biological inquiry. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function not involving changes in DNA sequence, the best examples of which are DNA methylation and histone modification. Because these processes help to regulate gene expression, but also may be affected by the expression of certain genes, miRNAs, and other molecular factors, their genome-wide study necessarily requires methods for integrative genomics, and thus provides a rich opportunity for challenging statistical work. In addition, because environmental factors can influence epigenetic processes, epigenetics may play a central role in gene-environment interactions, and thus provides additional interesting opportunities for epidemiologic research.<br /><br />The literature of DNA methylation emphasizes the "methylator phenotype", whose statistical description essentially involves clustering or latent class modeling.  Recent statistical research suggests that, in the context of epigenetics, model-based clustering may outperform metric-based and other nonparametric approaches.  My work has focused on finding computationally efficient solutions to model-based clustering problems in the context of DNA methylation, and the integration of DNA methylation data with other genomic data types.'

S'Professor Howitt was the first economist to demonstrate under general theoretical conditions that a central bank aiming to stabilize the rate of inflation must allow interest rates to respond vigorously to past changes in inflation. Specifically, with each percentage point increase in inflation, the central bank\'s interest rate must increase by more than one percentage point. This principle has proven to be of much practical value in the conduct of monetary policy throughout the world. In recent work with Professor Philippe Aghion of Harvard University, he has also shown how a country\'s long-run growth performance can be determined by policies and institutions that affect the incentive for firms to innovate. Lately that has led them to a theory of "Appropriate Growth Policy," according to which a country\'s institutions and prior state of development dictate which kinds of policies are likely best to promote growth. For example, more vigorous anti-trust policy is likely to promote growth in countries (and specific industries in a country) that are close to the world technology frontier, whereas the same policies are likely to retard growth in countries far behind the frontier.  Professors Howitt and Aghion developed this proposition theoretically and have found strong evidence for it using a rich firm-level data set covering all publicly listed manufacturing firms in the U.K. for about 20 years.'

She became fascinated with Latin America and that interest eventually led her to a Ph.D. in Latin American history. She has written two books on the Yaqui Indians, and is now engaged in a large research project on the Asian diaspora in Latin America and the Caribbean.<br /><br />The goal of Professor Hu-DeHart`s diaspora project is to uncover and recover the history of Asian migration to Latin America and the Caribbean, and to document and analyze the contributions of these immigrants to the formation of Latin/Caribbean societies and cultures. It should also contribute towards theorizing diasporas and transnationalism. The importance and timeliness of this research was most recently demonstrated by the election of Alberto Fujimori, son of Japanese immigrants, as president of Peru.

S'Professor Hurt\'s research focuses on nanomaterials and their applications and implications for human health and the environment.  Current research thrusts include the biological response to graphene-family nanomaterials, mechanisms of carbon nanotube uptake and toxicity, nano-silver and nano-copper transformations in the natural environment, safe material design, and the assembly and folding of graphene to make three-dimensional architectures for battery and supercapacitor electrodes<br /><br />Nanotoxicology<br /><br />A major thrust in the laboratory at this time is the study of the human health impacts of manufactured nanomaterials.  The nation has invested heavily in the  development of new nanomaterials, which are currently serving as a materials tool kit for the development of a vast array of new technologies.  The potential human health impacts of these nanomaterials is not fully understood and is an area of intense worldwide research at this time.  In collaboration with the biological laboratory of Agnes Kane, David Rand, and Diane Lipscombe laboratories, we are studying nanomaterial interactions with cells, cellular substractures (membranes and ion channels), and whole organisms (Drosophila). <br /><br />The group is synthesizing and characterizing model nanomaterials based on carbon, silver, and selenium, with precise control of size, shape, hydrophobicity, and metals form/content to identify those nanomaterial features ultimately responsible for toxic responses. The samples are subjected to cellular and molecular assays that include metal mobilization and redox activity, cell viability, DNA damage and antioxidant destruction.  The long term goal is to identify synthesis and purification proceedures that minimize human health impacts.  We are striving for "green" nanomaterials that have been co-optimized for human health impacts and material performance.    <br /><br />Current research includes a special focus on the biological responses to graphene-family materials, comprising monolayer graphene, few-layer graphene, and graphene oxide.  We hypothesize the biological responses are functions of lateral dimension, layer number, and surface chemistry.  We are studying adsorption and quenching artifacts associated with the ultra-high surface area of graphene materials, and their uptake and localization in cells in close collaboration with the pathology laboratory of Agnes Kane.  <br /><br />Biological and Environmental Applications<br /><br />The Hurt laboratory is developing a nanomaterial-based technology for capture of mercury release from compact fluorescent lamps.  The technology uses reactive barriers of unstabilized amorphous nSe for high efficiency room-temperature reaction with elemental mercury vapor.  The laboratory is also collaborating with the Kane laboratory to develop carbon-selenium composites for treatment of mesothelioma.   Recent work is addressing graphene-based environmental barriers, and composites made from folded graphene nanoparticles <br /><br />Carbon Nanomaterials<br /><br />Another activity in the laboratory is the synthesis and characterization of novel carbon nanoforms from liquid crystalline precursors. This laboratory has pioneered techniques for the molecular control of carbon structure using surface-directed assembly of disk-like polyaromatic compounds. Confining discotic liquid crystals in nanospaces yields unique supramolecular fluid structures that can be quenched into functional organic solids or polymerized into carbon materials. Choosing the template material and geometry gives precise molecular control of crystal structure and interfaces, and can be used to fabricate optimal nanocarbon forms for fuel cells, batteries, sensors, and nanocomposites. Additional projects focus on the assembly of chromonic liquid crystals into carbon nanotubes, nanoribbons, and optical aniotropic carbon thin films. The group is also interestesd in the order/diorder phase transitions, wetting, spreading, and surface anchoring of polyaromatic compounds to understand the fundamental molecular interactions that drive these directed assembly processes.  The newest topic in the group is the use of fine metal catalyst particles to etch complex patterns or pores in graphene and carbon thin films.  The work includes the use of magnetic catalyst particles whose etch tracks can be steered through the application of external magnetic fields.'

S"STATISTICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH<br /><br />There are several avenues of my statistical and methodological research:  (1) development of data structures: tracking individuals through health care settings and following nursing home characteristics over time [16, 17]; (2) development of models for informative censoring; (3) developments of tools for exploring and interpreting results of novel statistical methods [18-21]; (4) utilization of novel statistical methods in HSR. This includes selection bias in observational data [22-24], multilevel models for nested data [14, 25], and utilizing population average models for studying the effects of policies in longitudinal studies [26-31].<br /><br />&#9;As a researcher I have been acutely aware of the need for integrated quality data. This was necessary to allow the study of post acute care service provision and outcomes, to identify particular populations in data, and to monitor changes longitudinally. To study health care utilization by nursing home residents, I have developed the Residential History File (RHF) that combines information from the Minimum Dataset assessments of nursing home residents with Medicare claims to track individuals' health service locations continuously over time [16]. Currently I am in the process of validating the ability of the method to detect episodes of nursing home care by comparing with Medicaid information regarding nursing home use of dually eligible residents. The RHF has been used extensively in research at the Center for Gerontology including several studies of post acute care utilization [8, 10, 32], a study of intensity of health care costs at the end of life [22, 33, 34], and a study of feeding tube placement among nursing home residents. Recently, I have begun to incorporate part B provider claims into the RHF to provide additional information for tracking patients in nursing homes, and to study the provision of physician services in nursing homes.<br /><br />While studying inpatient utilization of HIV positive patients, I became acutely aware of the potential for confounding from informative censoring due to death. Consequently, in a collaboration with Tony Lancaster from the Economics Department at Brown University, we developed a method that jointly models hospitalizations and mortality, and disentangles the effects of the same factor on hospitalization and death. This novel method appears to have inspired a line of research for other statisticians with 8 citations in 2004 [11]. <br /><br />As a follow-up to the work on joint modeling of mortality and hospitalization, I examined health care costs at the end of life prospectively in a cross-sectional cohort. Till now, all analyses of costs at the end of life used a cohort of decedents, and examined their patterns of utilization and costs in the months preceding death. I was concerned that by selecting to study decedents, there was no comparable comparison group. In addition, the non-random selection of hospice, given an individual's proximity to death, had never been accounted for prospectively. I used a longitudinal model where for each time period the predicted probability of death and of hospice selection were used as inverse probability weights in a model for costs. This method was presented at several conferences, and is currently being written up for publication [22, 24]. <br /><br />NURSING HOME RESEARCH<br /><br />Nursing homes are complex organizations, providing services to residents from the community and from hospital, drawing from market resources, and regulated by local, state, and federal standards. Individually, and collaboratively, I have addressed many of these issues in my studies. With Jackie Zinn, I have mostly examined the relationship of institutions and markets [26, 31, 35]; with Vince Mor, I have primarily examined the effects of policy on nursing home behaviors, including hospitalizations [15, 26, 31, 36-40].<br /><br />I have been particularly interested in hospitalization from the nursing home, as it is a potential marker of quality of care and of increased costs. One aspect of my study has been to define the double-edges of this sword: hospitalizations are both necessary in some cases and potentially avoidable in other cases. Drawing upon work on ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations, I lead a collaboration with a colleague geriatrician, David Gifford, to determine which hospitalizations may, on average, be termed potentially preventable. The innovations of this study were the distinction of hospitalization of long-stay nursing home residents from community patients admitted to hospital, and the use of both admission and discharge diagnoses. A survey of leading experts, primarily from the U.S. and Canada, confirmed most of the definitions. Given this expertise, I was invited to participate in an expert panel that examined the same issues in the Canadian health care setting.  <br /><br />A recent avenue of research is the study of the provision of physician services in nursing homes. This work continues my interest in examining the availability of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in nursing homes, and the associated reduction in hospitalization rates, especially potentially preventable ones. Since 2001 I have been working with Paul Katz and Jurgis Karuza from the University of Rochester examining data that they collected from Medical Directors in nursing homes. This lead to an R21 grant to Dr. Katz with a subcontract to Brown, of which I am a PI. The focus of this grant is the development of a survey instrument and method to examine the organization of medical practice in the nursing home from the medical director's perspective. In the past year I have lead an effort to examine the organization of physicians in nursing homes from the director of nursing and administrator perspective. This effort is part of the PO1, and will have a survey component. In addition it adds a secondary data component to this study that is based on physician and NP billing for services provided to nursing home residents. <br /><br />I have recently received approval from CMS to obtain physician billing data from my collaborators at Dartmouth to study their utility to the development of the Residential History File, and in order to examine their utilization in developing measures of physician practice patterns in nursing homes. This research is state-of-the-art, in the way that it uses administrative data, and is supplemented by primary data. The particular project, as part of the PO1 was received with much enthusiasm by the reviewers in the reverse site visit this past July 2005.<br />&#9;<br />INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS<br /><br />As a fellow of InterRAI, an organization devoted to the development of standardized assessment tools for evaluation of care of the elderly world-wide, and to the conduction of cross-national studies, I continue collaborations with other Israeli members. We implement the MDS suite of instruments in various settings in Israel, and conduct research that assists in their improvement [41]. Currently, I am chairing an international committee of InterRAI members charged with redesigning the Delirium Client Assessment Protocol, a guideline for identification and treatment of delirium in various settings. As part of this initiative, I have been working with two geriatrician colleagues examining the current nursing home MDS based trigger for delirium, and devising better triggers using MDS items, while validating using information from MDS, residential history file, and hospitalization. The revised triggers will be adapted to other settings and MDS instruments, such as post-acute and acute care, and will later be validated in other countries.<br /><br />CURRENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA<br /><br />In 2003-2004, the Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research underwent a planning process, and identified 4 areas of research, including that of nursing home research. The Center formed working groups for each, and assigned leaders and co-leaders for each group. I was chosen to co-lead the Nursing Home Research Group at the Center alongside Vince Mor. This largest of the 4 subject groups at the Center currently includes about 15 investigators, postdoctoral students, and senior staff members. As the co-leader, I have been instrumental in the development of a PO1 program project proposal (PI Vince Mor) that includes 4 projects and 3 cores (submitted February 2005). In this effort, I am PI on the statistics and data management core. I am also PI on one of the four projects that examines the organization of physicians' practice in nursing homes, and participate in another project that examines market correlates of transitions in care settings of long-term-care patients. My involvement in many of the studies looking at state policies regarding nursing homes, and their effects on nursing home behaviors and resident outcomes will continue to inspire my future research.<br /><br />&#9;Since April 2004, I have been involved with the Providence VA Health Services Research and Development Targeted Research Enhancement Program (HSR&D TREP) as both investigator and center statistician. In that capacity, I have provided statistical consultation to several proposals developed by TREP investigators, and have also developed my own project proposal, to extend my work in nursing home research to the VA. The project that I have currently under review examines the differences in hospitalization rates for veterans served in VA and contract facilities. I am excited about this new avenue of research at the VA, and am planning to continue to establish this line of research in collaborations with other VA researchers.<br /><br />&#9;My future plans are to continue to study the organization of physicians and medical staff in nursing homes, their quality correlates, and policy and market factors impacting on their formation. On the methodological side, I plan to work on profiling providers controlling for selection bias, and on methods to estimate total (direct and indirect) effects."

S'Areas of interest: race and ethnic relations, Latino immigration, development. <br /><br />My work focuses on two areas. The first is identity and group formation, with a focus on processes of racialization, and ethnic and nation formation. I am currently conducting research on the racial and ethnic identity formation among first and second generation Dominican immigrants, on the formation of Latino/a communities and identities, and on the formation of immigrant transnational communities. I am also conducting comparative research on the forms of nationalism in Latin America.  <br /><br />My second area of interest is the political economy of inequality. I have conducted research on labor markets and the informal economy in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. Currently I am working on the employment strategies and trajectories of Latin American immigrants in the United States. I am also studying the recuperated factories in Argentina (factories that have been taken over by workers who run them as worker-owned cooperatives), assessing the conditions that sustain collective action and the organizational forms of the worker-owned factories.  <br /><br />I work within the world-system theoretical paradigm, but I am interested in the local variations within the world economic and political systems. I investigate how local and regional institutional forms and identity formation processes develop and interact with world-systemic trends. I am the author of <i>Developing Poverty</i> (Penn State Press, 2000) and numerous articles published in journals such as <i>Social Forces</i>, <i>International Migration Review</i>, <i>Ethnic and Racial Studies Review</i>, and <i>Radical Philosophy Review</i>.'

S'Several clinically important diseases and tumor-associated genetic alterations have been linked to human chromosome 9p. We are focusing our research on two different diseases whose causative genes are located on 9p. We are interested in identifying the mechanism by which mutations in the gene RMRP, RNA component of the mitochondrial RNA processing gene, cause the genetic disease cartilage-hair hypoplasia. This recessive genetic disease affects many body systems with the primary characteristics being the short limb-short stature and fine sparse hair that give the disease its name. We are using both cell culture and animal models to investigate the mechanism of this disease. A second locus of interest on 9p is that of a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Data from studying DNA deletions in tumors as well as in vitro cell culture indicate that there is a growth regulatory gene on 9p. We are trying to identify this gene using a cloning strategy that takes advantage of the information available from the Human Genome Project.'

S"I am no longer conducting laboratory research, but the major goal of my research was to understand the physiological mechanisms that adapt animals to stresses such as anoxia, acidosis, and variable temperature. The focus was on ectothermic vertebrates, such as freshwater turtles, that can survive long periods without oxygen and can function over a wide range of body temperatures. Studies were carried out on whole animals, on isolated organs, and on cell preparations.  My most recent research sought to understand the mechanisms that permit a freshwater turtle to survive prolonged submergence, particularly during its winter hibernation when ice cover prevents breathing. Experiments considered the ecological situations in which the animals are either in anoxic or oxygenated water. Specific objectives were to understand the role of the shell and skeleton in acid buffering, to clarify the fate of lactate during recovery from anoxia, to explore the response of heart and heart muscle to graded hypoxia, and to define the mechanisms and limitations of aquatic gas exchange.  My laboratory also had an interest in the comparative physiology of respiration and gas exchange. Work in this area included investigations of the metabolic cost of breathing in turtles, gas exchange and acid-base balance during torpor in the little brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, and the functional significance of aerial gas exchange in air-breathing fish.<br /><br />Since my retirement, I have continued writing and teaching.  My major activity has been writing a book entitled:  Life in a Shell: A Physiologist's View of a Turtle, which has recently been published by Harvard University Press.  I have also co-written two review articles and an article entitled: Academic genealogy and direct calorimetry: a personal account, which is currently IN PRESS in the American Journal of Physiology."

S'Margot Jackson is an assistant professor of sociology at Brown.  Her research interests focus on social stratification and health, with an emphasis on inequality among children and families.  Her work examines life cycle and intergenerational aspects of the relationship between social circumstances and health, with a particular interest in understanding the early life cycle origins of inequality and the role of child health in the production of social inequality.  One current project investigates how poor health in early childhood produces cumulative academic inequality, and whether parents\' educational behaviors compensate for or reinforce inequalities during the school years.  In related work, Jackson is studying how the timing and duration of early health investments&#151;specifically, U.S. childhood nutritional policy&#151;play a role in reducing educational inequality.  Finally, Jackson is extending her research to children in immigrant families to examine the emergence of a socioeconomic gradient in health among the second generation.  Jackson received her Ph.D. from UCLA in 2007 and is also an affiliate of the Population Studies and Training Center (PSTC) and Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences (S4).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://statcounter.com/" target="_blank" title="click tracking"></a>'

S'Current Project<br />One cannot truly master the Japanese language without understanding the intricate speech levels of the language and appropriately switching formal and informal registers.  In fact, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Japanese Proficiency Guidelines require test takers to "participate fully and effectively in conversations in formal and informal settings..." in order to pass the Superior Level proficiency test.  It is undoubtedly one of the most challenging areas of Japanese language learning.  Traditionally, with sound pedagogical reasons, we have focused on formal speech, which includes complicated honorific and humble polite words and grammatical patterns.  It is very common for students to have difficulties understanding and becoming proficient in using appropriate forms and degree of formality in given situations.  Over the years, I have observed that students of Japanese develop a certain degree of anxiety over making mistakes that could result in socially awkward situations.  This anxiety seems to grow stronger as students progress their proficiency level.  My intent is to develop a reference text that explains both linguistic and context appropriateness in various social and business situations with examples.'

S'In my research for the book, <i>Birders of a Feather: Stories of People, Birds, and Other People in Africa</i>, I am using people\'s interest in birds to examine race, gender, nationality, science, development, and conservation in sub-Saharan Africa. I am drawing on research in the U.S., the U.K., South Africa, and Zambia to encompass a range of topics: the impact on birds of human development in the past two centuries; traditional African relations with birds, both conceptual and material; ornithology conducted by white Euro-Americans in a colonial context; the participation of black collectors and taxidermists in ornithological research; and finally, the more recent attempts in conservation and ecotourist initiatives to integrate African and European ways of knowing about and relating to birds. This book is intended for a general readership in the United States, Europe, and Africa.<br /><br />My long-term project is to continue development of curricular materials on the history of twentieth-century Africa. I have compiled a broad collection of obscure primary sources for an introductory lecture course (AF16). These include memoirs by "ordinary" Africans, interviews with illiterate people whose perspectives might otherwise be forgotten, writings of colonial officials, and commentary by elite politicians and intellectuals. I have also collected photographs, artistic representations, and music that offer windows in past decades. I will continue my search for useful documents and hope eventually to edit them for publication as a book. I am also continuing to develop a web-based reference tool, the Animated Atlas of African History (AAAH), which is publicly available at http://www.brown.edu/Research/AAAH/.'

S'I hail from Holland, Michigan and received my BA from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the problems of apartheid South Africa captured my intellectual interest.  I received an MA in African Studies from UCLA and a PhD in History from Indiana University. South African historiography had a strong tradition of social history, but looking at rural areas, I felt that a stronger consideration of environmental factors was necessary to understand the decline of food production and increase in dependence on wage labor among black South Africans.  This was the subject of my dissertation research and of my subsequent monograph, Environment, Power, and Injustice: A South African History (Cambridge 2003).  The common theme between my first book and my current research on people and birds is that both probe the nexus between environment, social division, and power.'

S'The focus of my research has been on European and Israeli Hebrew writers who transformed biblical narratives, rabbinic legends, and hasidic tales into modern works of literature that convey the relationship of the author to the Jewish tradition and to issues of contemporary significance. My first book, Modern Midrash: The Retelling of Traditional Jewish Narratives by Twentieth-Century Hebrew Writers (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987), focused on adaptations of Hasidic tales by the European Hebrew writers Micha Yosef Berdyczewski and Y. L. Peretz, adaptations of rabbinic legends by the European Hebrew poet Chaim Nachman Bialik, adaptations of biblical narratives by the European Hebrew writer David Frischmann, and the role of biblical archetypes in the poetry of the European Hebrew writers Shaul Tchernichowsky and Yocheved Bat-Miriam and the works of the Israeli writers Amir Gilboa, Abba Kovner, Dan Pagis, Nissim Aloni, Moshe Shamir, and Amos Oz.<br /><br />In my second book, Does David Still Play Before You?: Israeli Poetry and the Bible (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1997), I focused on the role of Hebrew Bible in contemporary Israeli poetry and culture as reflected in poems by several Israeli writers: Amir Gilboa, T. Carmi, Nathan Yonathan, Matti Megged, Yehuda Amichai, Anadad Eldan, Nathan Zach, Dan Pagis, Haim Gouri, Aryeh Sivan, Moshe Dor, Yehudit Kafri, Dalia Ravikovitch, Asher Reich, Meir Wieseltier, Aliza Shenhar, Edna Aphek, Rachel Chalfi, Yitzhak Laor, and Maya Bejerano.<br /><br />My third book, Creator, Are You Listening?: Israeli Poets on God and Prayer (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006) focused on the relationship of six contemporary Israeli poets with a variety of Jewish cultural backgrounds to the experience of the absence and presence of God and to the nature of prayer. These poets include: Zelda MIshkovsky, Yehuda Amichai, Asher Reich, Rivka Miriam, Admiel Kosman, and Hava Pinhas-Cohen.<br /><br />My fourth book, Beyond Political Messianism: The Poetry of Second-Generation Religious Zionist Settlers (Brighton, Mass.: Academic Studies Press, 2011) is about the emergence of poetry among religious Zionists associated with the Israeli settler movement in the West Bank.<br /><br />I have also written on the portrayal of the Arab-Israeli conflict in contemporary Israeli fiction, the responses in kibbutz Passover haggadot to the conflict over Israel/Palestine by Jews and Arabs during the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939, and the retelling of the biblical Exodus narrative in a novel by Israeli writer Shulamith Hareven.'

Are surface sentences directly assigned a meaning (i.e., a model-theoretic interpretation) or are they instead mapped into a level of Logical Form, which is then interpreted? Just what phenomena should be accounted for in the syntax, and what phenomena should be accounted for in the semantics? Using techniques from both linguistics and logic, these general questions are approached by detailed investigation of areas such as pronominal binding, quantifier scopes, extraction, anaphora, and especially the interaction of all these phenomena. Additional interests include mathematical linguistics and the boundaries between semantics and pragmatics.'

S'My research focuses on the evolutionary history of large mammals, both in terms of their anatomy (and what this can reveal about past behaviors) and their community structure. My particular interest is in ungulate (hoofed mammals) evolution over the past 20 million years or so.  <br />    Mammalian community structure, especially that of large herbivores, has a high correlation with local habitats and environments, and change in community structure over time can reveal patterns of climatic change. In my role as senior editor for the volumes "Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of North America" (Cambridge University Press: 1998, 2008) I have accumulated a large amount of information on North American species over the past 65 million years, relating to both presence in fossil localities and ecomorphological characteristics.  <br />    I am currently collaborating with Mikael Fortelius and Jussi Eronen (University of Helsinki), who manage the NOW (Neogene Old World Mammals) database, to combine the North American data with that from the Eurasia. Work in submission shows that mammalian communities reveal very different patterns of rainfall and encroaching aridity over the past 20 million years between the two areas. Previous work with John Damuth (University of California, Santa Barbara) has shown interesting patterns in mid Miocene (~17 &#150; 12 million years ago) ungulate communities in North America, where the faunas appear to be "over-rich" in browsers, possibly reflecting an increase in levels of plant productivity (see Janis, Damuth and Theodor 2000, 2002, 2004). Our ongoing research suggests that this was a worldwide phenomenon, thus implying some hitherto unknown global climatic conditions during the mid Miocene, and we currently have funding to investigate these trends with the herbivorous marsupial faunas of Australia. John Damuth and I have recently published a large review on hypsodonty (high-crowned teeth) in mammals.<br />   Other current research focuses more on the functional morphology of individual fossil lineages. I originally focused on the use of dental and skull remains to determine diet, but more recently have become interested in the postcranial skeleton and evolution of locomotion, including a study of the evolution of the pacing gait in camels (see Janis, Theodor and Boisvert, 2002) and the mode of locomotion in sthenurine kangaroos (extinct giant browsing forms) (Work in progress). Previous work on the reasons for the evolution of cursorial (so-called running) adaptations in ungulates (e.g., Janis and Wilhelm 1993), is being extended by work in progress with my former graduate students, Andrew Clifford; our hypothesis is that cursoriality is more related to energy conservation at slow gaits rather than to speed.<br />  Current research with Fulbright postdoctoral fellow, Borja Figueirido, relates to large scale patterns in mammalian diversity over the past 65 million years, plus landmark morphometric studies on craniodental morphology of ungulate mammals (extending my work of several years ago with new types of statistical analysis). We have also recently published a paper on the postcranial anatomy of the thylacine (the so-called "marsupial wolf"), showing that it was not as cursorially-adapted as assumed, and so unlikely to have had wolf-like hunting behavior.<br />In addition to academic research I also write around 40% of the textbook "Vertebrate Life" (Pough, Janis & Heiser). I was involved in the 5th edition (1998), 6th ed. (2001), 7th ed.(2004), 8th ed. (2008), and am currently working on the 9th edition.'

S'I\'ve wanted to be a paleontologist from an early age, triggered by being taken to see "Fantasia" at age 7. That was the year that I also started riding horses, so I attribute my career (as an ungulate [hoofed mammals] paleobiologist) to having outgrown neither the horse phase or the dinosaur phase.<br />As great as is the diversity of life on earth today, the fossil record increases out knowledge of life\'s diversity by many orders of magnitude. The fossil record also adds something that is lacking from the study of the living world alone: the dimension of time, and the documentation of what actually happened during the history of organisms.<br />Although one cannot study the biology of extinct animals directly, there are ways by which once can make sound inferences about what they were like as living beings, such as qualitative or quantitative comparison with living animals of known biology and/or the use of principles of biomechanics. (The use of isotope geochemistry is a new development in this area, but as I am primarily a biologist this is not a technique that I use myself.)<br /> Mammals are especially good subjects for paleobiological investigations, as their bony remains provide much information about diet and mode of locomotion, and there is a large diversity of living mammals with which to compare the fossil ones. The structure of the communities of fossil mammals, in terms of diversity of body sizes, and dietary and locomotor types, can also provide excellent information about their habitat (in an entirely different fashion from evidence from fossil plants), and tracking changes in communities through time can provide information as to the tempo and mode of climatic and environmental changes.'

S'Over the last three years, Dr. Carole Jenny has had the opportunity to work with the Aprica Childcare Institute on the issue of shaken baby syndrome and other pediatric head injuries.  The experimental work at the Aprica Childcare Institute has been extremely productive.  A list of presentations, research papers, and published documents concerning shaken baby syndrome and our research on biomechanics is appended (Appendix 1).  <br /><br />The types of head trauma researched include abusive head trauma, shaken baby syndrome, unintentional head trauma, and subtle forms of head trauma that may occur in the everyday environment of the infant.  The research IS based on the infant anatomic testing devices (ATD) "Aprica 2.5" and "Aprica 3.4" at Aprica\'s research facility in Nara.  <br /><br />Data generated by the Aprica ATDs will be used to generate a finite element model of the effects of shaking on the infant retina.  Modifications to the ATDs to study biomechanics of eye injuries with shaking will be studied.<br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />Several factors make human infants particularly vulnerable to head trauma:<br /><br />n&#9;They have poor head control and weak necks.  They cannot use their neck muscles to protect their heads from excessive rotational and translational forces;<br />n&#9;they have softer brains than adults due to less myelination of their brain tissue;<br />n&#9;infants have more fluid around their brains, allowing movement of brain tissue within the cranium; <br />n&#9;they are physically weak and unable to protect themselves against assault or abuse or against environmental insults; and,<br />n&#9;they are entirely dependent on the adults around them to protect them from physical dangers.<br /><br />Injuries to infants\' brains reflect a continuum of forces applied to their heads leading to a spectrum of anatomic and physiologic results.  At one end of the continuum we see shaken baby syndrome and other types of abusive head trauma where violent forces are purposefully applied to babies\' heads by angry adults.  The types of injuries we see in these children are similar to the injuries seen in infants involved in automobile crashes or multi-story falls from windows.<br /><br />Some unintentional and inflicted head injuries can involve less injurious forces applied to the head, such as household falls or the hitting of the head with a bare hand.  At the mildest end of the spectrum are head injuries that occur inadvertently in the child\'s environment.  In my experience, I have seen significant head injury occurring in an infant riding in an \'off-road\' vehicle over rough terrain and in an infant in her parents\' \'back pack\' on a \'mountain bike\' traveling over a very rocky trail.  Whether or not other types of vibrational forces can actually injure the infant brain is unknown.  For example, can tossing a baby in the air and catching him cause subtle brain injuries?  Can vigorously bouncing infants in an effort to calm them cause brain injuries?  These questions continue to be asked.<br /><br /><br />1.&#9;We are examining the biomechanical forces applied to infants\' heads during violent shaking, violent impact, impact plus shaking, and other events using the Aprica 3.4 ATD.<br /><br />We have previously conducted a series of experiments to address the basic question comparing the biomechanical forces applied to the infant brain through shaking a child and impacting a child on a hard surface using Aprica 2.5.  During this phase we will repeat some of those experiments with the Aprica 3.4 ATD.  We will measure angular and linear acceleration during shaking and impact events.  We will measure applied load during impact events.  <br /><br />The events to be enacted will be:<br />&#9;Shaking alone<br />&#9;Shaking with impact to floor<br />&#9;Shaking with impact to sofa<br />&#9;Slamming ATD to tatami mat without shaking<br />&#9;Rolling ATD off sofa to carpeted floor<br />&#9;Hitting ATD on the side of the head in a high chair, causing rotation of the head<br />&#9;Throwing ATD up in the air in a playful manner<br />&#9;Bouncing ATD on a knee.<br /><br />In addition to recording the data from the internal accelerometers, we will again use accelerometers applied to the ends of the \'tibias\' and \'ulnas\' to measure acceleration of the ends of the long bone during violent shaking.  Measurement of thoracic compression will also be noted due to the advanced features of the Aprica 3.6 ATD.<br /><br />2.&#9;Compare the results of shaking and slamming experiments with the Aprica 3.4 ATD with results of simulated acceleration deceleration events in the laboratory.<br /><br />The forces experience by the infant head in shaking has been compared to the forces experienced in car seats by young infants riding over very rough roads.  Using the sled, we will simulate stops and starts at various speeds, and compare the acceleration experienced by the infant dummy head during driving events to the forces experienced by violent shaking of the dummy.<br /><br />3.&#9;Finish the analysis of data from experiments with Aprica 2.5.<br /><br />Because of concern over discrepancy between high-speed video recording of angular acceleration and calculations of angular acceleration derived from linear accelerometers, we have delayed the publication of results from the experiments with Aprica 2.5.  We will reinterpret the original data and compare the results with the results from the experiments using Aprica 3.4.<br /><br />4.&#9;Compare the linear and angular acceleration generated during shaking of the two ATDs and evaluate the effect of body weight on the results of violent shaking.  <br /><br />Many factors affect the amount of injury inflicted on infants during abusive head trauma events.  Using the same person to violently shake the 3.4 kilogram dummy who took part in previous experiments (Mr. Mori), we will analyze the differential effect of the infant\'s size in approaching injury thresholds.<br /><br />5.&#9;Work with the Aprica Childcare Institute to prepare an educational videotape on the dangers of shaking babies, featuring the video recorded during the laboratory research on shaking of the infant dummy, Aprica 2.5.<br /><br />We have made significant progress on an educational video on shaken baby syndrome, but several things have to be done to finish the project, including identifying some new visual components.  This project will continue to be a part of Phase III, with the goal of finishing the video within the first month of Phase III.<br /><br />6.&#9;Work with AAP on the production and distribution mechanism for the shaken baby video.<br /><br />7.&#9;Design database for evaluating free falls in infants and toddlers.<br /><br />During Phase III, I plan to design data collection instruments for the scientific evaluation of the biomechanics of accidental infant and toddler falls.  The instruments will be based on similar instruments used by NHTSA to evaluate car crashes.  Specifically, I will create a system for the <br />systematic study of falls from windows.  Thousands of American children fall from windows each year, often from multistory windows.  These events provide a mechanism to study the effects of easily calculated gravitational forces on the bodies of infants and small children.    Data collection instruments will include parameters such as the height of the fall, the position and attitude of the body on impact, the nature of the impacted surface, the body surfaces contacting the impacted surfaces, and the nature and severity of the resulting injuries.  This project will give us tools to collect data that cannot be obtained in the laboratory.  <br /><br />Part B:  Development of a Finite Element Model of the Eye and Orbit with Salient Features led by Dr. Levin and Dr. Ranga.<br /><br />Retinal haemorrhaging is a cardinal manifestation of the Shaken Baby syndrome.  Because of ethical concerns, it is impossible, however, to develop an understanding of the pathogenesis of retinal haemorrhage or a causal relationship between violent shaking and eye injuries through direct experiments with animals.  We propose to develop a surrogate for the paediatric eye and develop the causal chain using the surrogate.<br /><br />An initial planning meeting was held in Washington, DC on March 30, 2004 to discuss strategies to evaluate the link between shaking and eye injury.  The meeting was attended by Drs. Alex Levin, Carole Jenny, Robert J. Bigge, Tariq. Shams, and N. Rangarajan.  It was agreed that the following research strategy would be adopted:<br /><br />1.&#9;We should first develop a finite element model of the eye and orbit with salient features. Collaboration with other centers such as ALGOR, University of Virginia, and University of Alabama will be sought and encouraged.<br />2.&#9;This model should be validated using data available in the literature and also using data that can be collected by Dr. Levin from patients undergoing eye surgery (for example, tensile strength of muscles, and translation distance of globe in and out of orbit).<br />3.&#9;The validated model should be exercised using input from shaking experiments conducted with Aprica 2.5 kg and 3.4 kg infant dummies.  Sensitivity of model output to the following should be evaluated:<br />a.&#9;The presence or absence of various features in the eye model.<br />b.&#9;The level of detail of each feature in the model<br />c.&#9;The physical characteristics of each feature in the model (for example, strength of attachment of various muscles).<br />4.&#9;Conclusions from the finite element model sensitivity study should be used to decide on the features that are to be incorporated in the Aprica 2.5 and 3.4 dummies, and the measurements to be made using the dummies.<br />5.&#9;The enhanced dummies should be used in shaken baby experiments to evaluate the effect of shaking on various parts of the eye, optic nerve and orbital tissues.<br />6.&#9;Since this is a multi-year project it is hoped that more data will become available and it will be possible by the end of the project to draw the causal chain from shaking to eye injury, if such a chain exists.<br /><br />The following tasks will be accomplished in the initial phase of this research proposal:<br /><br />1.&#9;Study commercially available finite element calculation engines and make an appropriate choice to use in this project.  <br /><br />The choice of finite element models will depend on the availability of features such as solid/fluid interface, the range of material models available and any relevant experience of previous investigators.<br /><br /><br />Geometry can be obtained from non-invasive medical images.  Physical properties of structures can be obtained directly from the literature or scaled from available data using normally accepted scaling methods.'

S"Jiang investigated how demographic compositional changes affected energy consumption and carbon emission in the US, China, India, and Europe. Using household survey data, this research revealed that population aging was important to the changes of energy use in the US, while urbanization and household size changes accounted for a large proportion of China's recent decrease of per capita residential energy consumption. Adopting the ProFamy model, Jiang made household projections for the US and China. Integrated analysis of characteristics of cross-sectional household energy use and household projection results reveals that population aging will significantly drive energy consumption downward in the US, and in some cases will exert an even more important effect on carbon emission than technological changes.  <br /><br />Jiang pays close attention to electrification and use of renewable energy resource among rural households of China. His research finds that residential energy transition from biomass to modern fuel in China plays an important role in the local and global environment changes, yet it is at an early stage. He is now extending the analysis to improving understandings of the effects of urbanization on energy use in the developing regions, and to adopt an integrated assessment model on the impacts of urbanization on land use. <br /><br />To meet the increasing requirements for better understanding future household dynamics, Jiang is devoted to improving methodology of household modeling. He aims at developing a new household projection model which on the one hand, integrates knowledge about future changes of demographic events into household dynamics and provides sufficient information for the analysis of socioeconomic and environmental trends; and that on the other hand, significantly reduces the amount of data requirement, which is a key problem hindering application of the more complicated household models. Using the ProFamy model and US household projection input file, he further investigates the relative importance of various demographic events on household formation, and projects the possible ranges of future US household compositional changes.  <br /><br />Funded by the Wellcome Trust Foundation, Jiang studies the impact of population migration on land degradation in Xinjiang, China. This research provides a classic case of population-environment interactions, and contributes to the knowledge on the effects of population movement on environment changes, despite most of existing researches focusing on the environmental impacts on migration. <br /><br />Jiang's work on population and household dynamics and housing condition was funded as a National Key Research Project by China National Census Office. Exploring 2000 micro dataset, he conducted the first nationwide study on Chinese housing conditions, and projected housing demand under different scenarios of future demographic changes. Jiang paid particular attention to the housing conditions of floating population in urban China, and investigated the impacts of rural-urban migration on slum expansion. He found that massive rural-urban migration did not induce slum expansion in China (mainly due to institutional intervention), and indicated that migration enables rural population to share part of the rapid economic development output in the urban areas. Under this framework, Jiang is studying residential segregation in Beijing Municipality."

S'Bacterial ribosomes are a major drug target for treating infectious diseases, and more than half of all antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis. The ribosome is a large and complex cellular machine that translates genetic information into proteins, which in turn carry out most of the metabolic functions required for cellular life. Because this translation from nucleic acids into amino acids is a fundamental process, ribosomes are present in all forms of life. Many antibiotic drugs (eg. streptomycin, the first drug to treat tuberculosis) bind selectively to bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis, ultimately killing the disease causing bacteria. Mutations within ribosomes that disrupt antibiotic binding sites or enable ribosomes to function in the presence of these antibiotic compounds are one cause for the emergence of resistance against ribosome targeting antibiotics. Structural studies of ribosomes carrying these antibiotic-resistance mutations are a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanism of resistance. This, in turn, can provide new leads for the development of new or modified compounds, which are active against resistant pathogens.<br />Our studies of the ribosome are carried out in a close collaboration with Drs. Albert Dahlberg and Steven Gregory here at Brown University. We use the bacterium Thermus thermophilus as a model system because this organism is amenable to both genetic and structural studies. Ribosomal mutations that result in resistance to streptomycin or a number of other antibiotic compounds have been identified and characterized in the laboratories of Dr. Dahlberg and Dr. Gregory. Because of the powerful combination of genetic expertise in the Dahlberg and Gregory laboratories and of crystallographic expertise in our laboratory, we are in a unique position to systematically examine mutant ribosome structures.<br />With ongoing experiments, we currently explore two broad areas of research. For the first area, we investigate the mechanism of antibiotic resistance and the impact of mutations and post-transcriptional modifications on ribosome structure and function. For the second area, we study ribosome modifying enzymes and other multi-specific enzymes to understand the molecular basis for multi-specific enzymatic activity.'

S"Conrad Johanson studies how the immature and aging central nervous system (CNS) reacts to the stressors of arterial hypertension, reduced blood flow and cerebrospinal fluid formation, elevated intracranial pressure, dehydration, and hyperthermia. The choroid plexus-Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) nexus has a pivotal role in regulating the composition and volume of the extracellular fluid of the CNS, i.e., the microenvironment of the neurons. His laboratory delineates mechanisms of CSF homeostasis and how these transport and distributional phenomena are altered in various pathological states (forebrain ischemia, hydrocephalus, and Alzheimer's disease). The operative working hypothesis is that perturbations and dwindling of the CSF dynamics (reduced CSF turnover) lead to dementia states. Reduced clearance of the beta-amyloid peptide from the CNS, for example, due to attenuated CSF formation and reabsorption, can cause neurotoxicity. <br /><br />Models of rats and transgenic mice are being used to provide insight on how fluid balance mechanisms and solute transport at the blood-CSF barrier (choroidal epithelium) are integrated with corresponding phenomena at the blood-brain barrier interface (cerebral endothelium). The translational goals are to develop agents and regimens that will repair/strengthen the regulatory 'barrier cells' in the choroid plexuses and in the neurovascular unit (endothelial cells, astroglia, and neurons). By therapeutically stabilizing the choroid plexus and cerebral microvessels in aging and early disease states (e.g., mild cognitive deficit and normal pressure hydrocephalus), it may be feasible eventually to extend neuroprotection to the latest periods of the lifespan."

S'Interdisciplinary research and training:<br /><br />The things that I\'m most excited about currently is research that lies at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, statistics, and neuroscience. Computational linguistics and machine learning are good examples of topics that lie at this nexus. We\'re lucky at Brown to have received generous external support for research and training in these areas. I am principal investigator of a National Science Foundation (NSF) Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program in this area. I am also involved with the Brain Science initiative at Brown. <br /><br /><b>Why computational linguistics?</b><br /><br />My area of research is computational linguistics. Linguistic theory focuses primarily on the structures involved in natural language, but in my opinion the structures alone are just a small part of the story. Language is active and dynamic; the processes of language learning, comprehension and production are what really bring language to life. That is, I believe that modern generative linguistic theories of syntax, semantics and phonology are on the right track as far as they go, but that they are missing a large part of the story because they focus on static representations, rather than the processes that create and manipulate these representations. Put rather crassly: representations just sit there, processes actually do something.<br /><br />There are many different ways to study these processes, but to me one of the fascinating challenges is to develop theories that are consistent with and build on the structures that standard linguistic theory provides. I also think that we want theories of these linguistic processes, which are clear and explicit, in much the same way as certain generative approaches to linguistics formulate clear, explicit, and precise grammar fragments in order to present and test their hypotheses. Manipulating information-bearing symbols is what computation is all about, so we want to understand the processes of language in computational terms.<br /><br />Computational linguistics is a truly interdisciplinary subject. It is a scientific discipline with important industrial and engineering applications (just like some areas of physics or chemistry). Intellectually it draws primarily on linguistics and computer science, and these days it draws heavily on statistics. But it also has growing contacts with psycholinguistics (the experimental study of human linguistic behaviour) and language acquisition (the experimental study of how humans learn language), and I think it should also have more contact with neurolinguistics (how language is realized in the brain).<br /><br />Industrially, computational linguistics is currently booming (just look at the jobs for computational linguists advertised on the Web). As more texts are available on-line, we need effective ways of searching, summarizing, and translating it. The applied side of computational linguistics, called Natural Language Processing, develops methods for automatically manipulating and extracting information from natural language. Several major corporations have declared that natural language processing will be a key technology in 21st century information processing; this coupled with the exponential growth of the Web has fueled a similiar expansion in job opportunities for computational linguists in natural language processing.<br /><br />We have an active, rapidly growing group of Computational Linguists at Brown. BLLIP (the Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing) is a group of undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs and faculty that meets weekly to discuss current research: everyone is welcome to attend!<br /><br /><b>Research interests</b><br /><br />Traditionally computational linguistics has worked with boolean "all or none" divisions, like the linguistic theory it was based on. But beginning with engineering work in speech recognition, it has become clear that there is a tremendous amount of valuable information in the statistical distribution of words and other linguistic constructs. While we still don\'t know exactly what information is available to a child learning his or her first language or a person understanding a sentence, it seems that both anguage learning and comprehension can reliably occur even though the information available is incomplete, uncertain or noisy. For example, by tracking whether a construction is more likely or less likely in a particular context, the comprehension process can be guided to the correct interpretation. Most of my recent papers are about using statistical information to guide interpretation in this sort of way.<br /><br />The process of identifying the structure of a sentence is called parsing. My research attempts to answer questions such as: What kinds of parsing algorithms can construct the various kinds of linguistic representations posited by different linguistic theories? How does their performance vary on different constructions? Which kinds of parsing algorithms perform in a way that mimics human language understanding (and might actually be used by humans)?<br /><br />In addition to the "hard\'\' constraints of the kind posited by conventional linguistic theory, human language exhibits a variety of "soft\'\' statistical regularities. Even though their origin is usually unknown (e.g., pragmatic), it may be that the human language processing mechanism exploits these regularities. Johnson\'s research in this area is directed toward discovering parsing algorithms that can exploit all of the "hard\'\' and "soft\'\' constraints in a systematic way.'

S"HOW DO CELLS FIND TARGETS?<br />I use pollen tube growth and guidance as a model system to understand the mechanisms of invasive cell growth, guidance of cellular migration, and determination of cellular polarity.  I study the fertilization process in flowering plants because the success of this fundamental component of the life cycle depends on a lengthy and precisely guided cellular journey.   Flowering plants have immotile sperm that must be delivered to female gametes by a pollen tube: a single cell that extends at remarkable growth rates, penetrates floral tissues, and responds to multiple precise and discrete signals that guide its growth.  To understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate fertilization, I've taken a genetic approach in Arabidopsis thaliana and have identified a collection of about 30 pollen mutants that define genes involved in each of the critical steps in the pollen tube growth and guidance process.  The major goal of my lab is to understand the functions of these and other genes responsible for plant fertilization."

S"My current research examines the forced emigration of musicians and music scholars from Nazi and Fascist Europe from 1933 to 1945. It began with the assembly of a comprehensive database. The flight of Europe's music had an overwhelming impact on the transmission of a great musical tradition from Europe to America. The forced emigration redefined the terms of the production, performance, and dissemination of that tradition and redrew the musical landscape of the societies that provided its refuge, most notably the United States. Of course, musicians constituted only one group in a vast migration, but the classical tradition they brought holds a special place in western culture. The transplantation of that tradition within one decade overwhelmed the American musical scene; no significant college, conservatory, university, opera house, concert hall, concert agency, or music publisher was left untouched. The impact was felt in every movie house in the nation. Not even jazz remained immune; Blue Note, the record company that arguably did more to disseminate jazz in the 1940s than any other, was the project of two &#233;migr&#233;s. Two areas where the &#233;migr&#233; influence counted less were Broadway and the synagogue, though even here they made their influence felt. <br /><br />The prestige of the immigrant musicians would have guaranteed their impact on music in America, even if had they not taught a generation of eminent students. But most of them did teach, whether by habit or necessity, exerting enormous influence as pedagogues, and some went on to create music schools and summer festivals. Less visible but no less significant was the impact of the hundreds of lesser musicians who found work in metropolitan and provincial opera houses and orchestras, in concert agencies, in high schools and settlement schools, in conservatories and colleges. Quietly, unrecognized outside their communities, these people grafted their culture onto America's.<br /><br />While the &#233;migr&#233; impact was obvious, assessing their impact is another matter. To simply assert that that migration was for the good of music in America and leave it at that is to read history backwards, from the point of view of the victors. On the other hand, to assert that that movement stifled the development of a native American music is to retreat into an isolationist fantasy. For all the good the migration produced, there was also a cost, and the balance sheet remains to be drawn up. <br /><br />American musicology has followed a similar path. A fledgling discipline from the founding of <i>The  Musical Quarterly</i> in 1915 until the arrival of the first refugees, it cast a bold amateur net across the European continent, south to Latin America, and along the Pacific and Indian Ocean rims. By 1950 the &#233;migr&#233;s had established musicology as a profession in American research universities; but they had narrowed its focus, concentrating on the Central European tradition they had brought with them and studying it exclusively in terms of philology and style analysis. The critical editions that sit in the stacks of our research libraries bear silent witness to their program. The &#233;migr&#233; model remained dominant into the 1980s, long after the passing of their generation, thanks to the teachings and writings of their American students. Only in the past two decades have alternative critical models emerged, and with them acceptance of world and popular American repertories as legitimate subjects of scholarly investigation. <br /><br />Since tracing and evaluating the impact of the &#233;migr&#233;s on the culture and production of American music is a social study built on personal stories, so too is the impact of America on the &#233;migr&#233;s. Who adapted successfully to America, and on what terms? Who did not? Although we find many successes and signal failures, it is the gray area in between failure and success that is most instructive, particularly when considering those musicians who did well but never managed a successful personal transition, retaining instead their European identities and predilections. Many stayed in the United States, usually for financial and family reasons, while others returned to Europe, either for good or for long regular visits, after the war's rubble began to clear. <br /><br />Adaptation was related to personal factors, among them a person's age, personality, fluency in English, and, in the cases of performers and composers, their familiarity to American audiences and the influence of American publishers and agents. Here individual narratives play a vital role, and the canvas is a sweeping one. There are stories of every stripe, ranging from the inspiring to the heartbreaking, many of them buried in archives, obscure journals, newspapers, and memoirs.<br /><br />I am planning two books on focused aspects of this general subject. The first is a biography, much of which I have now written, of Kathi Meyer-Baer, the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in musicology (Leipzig 1915). Unable to find a position in the German academic world as a woman and a Jew, she earned a living as a music journalist in the 1920s, published as an independent scholar, and managed the largest private music library on the continent. In 1938 she fled with her husband and child to France, then to the United States two years later, where she encountered many of the same professional hurdles she had found in Europe. Nevertheless, she produced a large and varied output of books and articles, and maintained a lively presence in the American musicological community. A biography is long overdue. The second book, the research for which is also largely completed, will be an account of the involvement of the two great American and British academic rescue committees of the 1930s in helping &#233;migr&#233; music scholars establish themselves in their host countries."

S"Djuro Josic is a professor of medicine (research) at Brown and director of the Proteomics Core in the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence Center for Cancer Research Development (COBRE CCRD) at the Rhode Island Hospital. One of main goals of our Core is to engender young investigators with broad scientific capabilities, thereby optimizing their productivity and funding opportunities. To this end, the facility works closely with investigators to ensure experimental success by offering consulting, experimental advice, and help with reagent and protocol development. <br /><br />In response to facility user needs, we have developed the technology for isolation of highly pure organelles from cell homogenizates by use of monoclonal antibodies specific for particular organellar proteins. These antibodies can be immobilized onto magnetic beads or highly porous monolithic supports. Using this new system, we can fractionate whole cells and isolate highly pure organelles, with the final goal to characterize cellular proteins and enrich low abundance proteins for further separation and identification by use of mass spectrometry (MS). <br /><br />In cooperation with the Molecular Pathology Core also belonging to the COBRE CCRD Program (Murray Resnick and Patricia Meitner) and together with a COBRE CCRD Investigator, Steven Moss, we established a new method for the identification of proteins after extraction from formalin-fixed tissue samples. This method will make possible retrospective analyses and direct comparison of normal and malignant samples from the Tissue Bank in the Molecular Pathology Core. <br /><br />In cooperation with A. Grollman from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the University of Zagreb, Croatia, we are starting proteomic analyses of urine and serum from sensitive and non-sensitive animals after treatment with aristolochic acid. This substance is suspected of causing chronic kidney failure in men, known as Balkan Endemic Nephritis (BEN), that can result in the development of urothelial cancer.  This mouse model is further useful to better understand the kidney failure that is caused by this environmental agent and sometimes ends with kidney or urothelial cancer.<br /><br />In cooperation with Werner Reutter, Professor of Medicine at the Humboldt University in Berlin, we are developing methods for the isolation of plasma membranes from rat liver and hepatocarcinoma Morris hepatomas 7777 with minimal contamination from other organelles by use of monolithic supports and magnetic beads (see above). Additionally, methods for identification of hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins by LC/MS-MS were developed. These proteins are difficult to identify because of very low yield if routine protocols for tryptic digestion and LC separation of hydrophobic peptides and glycopeptides are applied.<br /><br />We also established a collaboration with G. Silverberg, professor of neurology at Brown University in order to identify biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Samples of treated and non-treated patients were compared by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. After statistical analysis of mass spectra of cerebrospinal fluids, possible biomarkers able to distinguish patients that respond to the treatment from non-responding patients were identified. Identification of biomarkers is the first step for fast and simple diagnosis of  Alzheimer's disease and for simple and rapid follow up of disease treatment."

S'Trained as a Middle Eastern archaeologist and involved in archaeological excavations for 35 years, I research the domestication of plants and animals, the advent of Middle East urbanism and the varied cultural developments in Anatolia (ancient Turkey), Syro-Palestine, Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq), and ancient Iran-from the earliest times to the Hellenistic and Roman periods.<br /><br />For 10 years the Brown University Petra Great Temple excavations in Jordan have been under my direction, thus my primary interests concentrate on researching Nabataean cultural history. Over 100 articles have been published about this astonishing site. Various aspects of the site research have been presented in four Brown University doctoral dissertations, three M.A. theses, and six undergraduate Senior Theses-four of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Several documentary films have included our project, including the Arts and Entertainment Network and the Learning Channel, which have been aired worldwide.<br /><br />Our research, beyond excavation, has included scientific applications including surveying with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), artifact studies and databases, and analyses including Instrumental Neutron Activation (INAA), fresco pigment analysis, palynology, marble isotopes, stone weathering, and dendrochronology. It should come as no surprise that all of these are techniques that are dependent upon the expertise of our team members.

S"Christopher Kahler's work has focused on three primary topics: (a) the contribution of personality, psychiatric conditions, and emotional processes to the causes and treatment of alcohol and tobacco addiction, (b) methods for assessing alcohol use, problems, and dependence, and (c) the etiology and treatment of the co-use of alcohol and tobacco. He has published extensively in these and other areas with over 140 peer-reviewed publications to date. His most recent publications focus on changes in depressive symptoms following smoking cessation, the measurement of alcohol use and problems, relations between smoking, personality and psychopathology, and the treatment of heavy alcohol use in the context of smoking cessation treatment. He is currently conducting an NIAAA-funded laboratory study that investigates cognitive, affective, and behavioral mechanisms through which alcohol, when consumed in the lab, contributes to difficulties in delaying smoking when delaying smoking is rewarded with money. He is also conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing naltrexone to placebo among at-risk and problem drinkers seeking smoking cessation treatment. The study tests the hypotheses that naltrexone, when added to nicotine patch and a smoking cessation treatment that incorporates a brief alcohol intervention, will result in a lower percentage of heavy drinking days and a greater odds of smoking abstinence compared to placebo. He is conducting a developmental trial to test the efficacy of incorporating positive psychotherapy into smoking cessation treatment.  Finally, he is Scientific Director of the Alcohol Research Center on HIV, in which he is conducting a randomized clinical trial to test the effects of brief alcohol intervention on drinking and HIV-related outcomes among MSM in an HIV primary care clinic."

S'MECHANISMS OF ASBESTOS CARCINOGENESIS<br />     Asbestos fibers persist in the lungs and cause chronic inflammation, pulmonary and pleural fibrosis, lung cancer, and malignant mesothelioma after latent periods of 20-40 years. Recent experimental evidence based on animal models using genetically-engineered mice have provided new insight about the mechanistic links between chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. Recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in response to biopersistent fibers is accompanied by release of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidant stress, DNA damage, and mutations. Inflammatory cells can release cytokines and growth factors that stimulate stromal remodeling and angiogenesis. It is hypothesized that reciprocal activation of tumor and stromal cells facilitates growth and invasion of diffuse malignant mesothelioma. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays using well-characterized, transplantable murine mesothelial cell lines will be used to test this hypothesis. Newly-developed technologies including laser capture microdissection, cDNA microarrays, and quantitative analysis of gene expression provide powerful tools for this experimental approach.<br /><br />NANOTECHNOLOGY AND NANOTOXICOLOGY<br />     Nanotechnology is an emerging discipline with promising applications for environmental remediation at Superfund and other toxic waste sites.  Airborne nanosize dusts are produced as combustion by-products and have been identified as a major contributor of adverse health effects of air pollution.  New engineered nanomaterials are being developed for use as environmental sensors, in-situ catalysts for detoxification of chemical wastes, and diagnostic and drug delivery devices.  The potential human health effects of occupational and environmental exposure to nanomaterials is unknown.  Agnes Kane, Professor of Medical Science, and Robert Hurt, Professor of Engineering, are collaborating on an interdisciplinary research project investigating the toxicology of nanomaterials.

S"Rami Kantor, an Associate Professor of Medicine, studies the evolution of HIV drug resistance to antiretroviral medications in patients who are taking those drugs, which jeopardizes treatment success. He investigates HIV diversity and its potential implications on the evolution of drug resistance. HIV researchers in the past 20 years focused on HIV-1 subtype B, the predominant variant in resource-rich setting such as North America, Europe, and Australia. However globally, non-B subtypes and recombinant forms predominate, and are responsible for >90% of HIV infection. The main research question is whether knowledge of drug resistance in subtype B can be implemented in non-subtype B infected persons. The research hypothesis is that the enormous diversity among HIV types, groups, subtypes, and recombinant forms has an impact on the evolution of drug resistance.  Kantor's research incorporates bioinformatics, sequence and phylogenetic analyses, databases and data management, creation and improvement of various analysis tools, as well as basic laboratory research. He is focusing on the study of the evolution of drug resistance in HIV variants that predominate in resource-limited settings and in developing countries, where the majority of the AIDS epidemic is located."

S"The following summarizes the broad themes of this laboratory:<br />1.  Molecular bases of major psychiatric disorders.<br />(a)  Pathological aging in schizophrenia.<br />&#9;We recently observed that greater telomere shortening occurs in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls.  Telomeres, which are specialized DNA repeats located at the ends of chromosomes, progressively shorten with age.  There is general agreement that increased telomere shortening in medical conditions is indicative of accelerated aging.  These findings are consistent with clinical findings suggesting that rapid aging may be occurring in schizophrenia.  Our laboratory is currently investigating the molecular bases and implications of these findings.<br />(b)  Expression profiling in major psychiatric disorders.<br />&#9;The search for laboratory tests to establish the diagnosis of major psychiatric disorders has a long history spanning decades.  The difficulties inherent in such a search include the challenges of psychiatric diagnoses, the limitations in examining the living brain non-invasively, and the subtlety of findings observed outside of the central nervous system.  Nonetheless, advances are being made through the use of sensitive molecular techniques that delve into protein or gene expression profiles from a variety of tissues.  We are currently using a proteomics approach to search for biomarkers to differentiate schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and individuals with no major psychiatric disorder.<br />(c)  Is it possible to detect evidence of psychiatric dysfunction in experimental animals?<br />&#9;To advance research into psychiatric disorders it is desirable to have animal models, which have considerably advanced our knowledge in other fields of medicine.  We are currently studying synapsin III knockout mice to examine behaviors linked to psychiatric disorders.  Synapsin III is a presynaptic phosphoprotein that is a member of a family of presynaptic proteins known as synapsins.  The rationale for examining this particular mouse is because levels of synapsin III have been shown to be decreased in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia, specifically in regions implicated in this disorder, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.  Synapsins have also been implicated in the coordinate regulation of presynaptic protein levels, which as a group are downregulated in schizophrenia.  Moreover, there is genetic evidence supporting a potential role for synapsin III in schizophrenia.<br />&#9;Among the current investigations that may have implications for psychiatric disorders are: (i) a functional polymorphism within the human synapsin III gene that occurs more frequently in individuals with schizophrenia compared to matched controls, and that disrupts MAP kinase signalling; (ii) regulation of adult neurogenesis by the synapsin III gene; and (iii) behaviors consistent with dopaminergic dysregulation in synapsin III knockout mice.  Investigations are ongoing to extend these original observations and to relate them to other phenomenon known to occur in schizophrenia and other major psychiatric conditions.  In addition, other animal models are being investigated.<br /><br />2.  Signal transduction in neurons.<br />(a)  Synaptic vesicles as scaffolds for cellular signaling.<br />&#9;This project originated from the unexpected finding that synapsins, a family of synaptic vesicle associated proteins, regulates neurodevelopment.  Our subsequent investigations revealed that synapsins regulate signal transduction, probably by affecting the composition of signalling complexes anchored to vesicles.  The concept that vesicles serve as a platform for signal transduction is particularly important for retrograde neurotrophic signalling and other pathways initiated by receptor activation.  Vesicle-mediated signal transduction potentially relevant for schizophrenia, major affective disorders, and Alzheimer's disease.  Very little is known regarding the mechanism by which signalling is regulated on vesicles.  These investigations, using synapsins as a tool, will enable us to better understand this important facet of signal transduction.<br />(b)  Novel biosensors for cellular signaling.<br />&#9;The principal means by which cellular signaling is achieved is by protein phosphorylation pathways.  Typically, activation of these pathways is monitored using either radioactive compounds or phosphorylation-state specific antibodies.  Since the discovery of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), from Aequorea victoria many investigators have exploited this protein as a tool to detect physiological changes within the cell.  A long-term goal of this project is to use these proteins to develop fluorescent biosensors for the detection of protein phosphorylation within living cells.  Towards this goal, we have cloned a diverse collection of fluorescent proteins from marine life derived from the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, the Belizean Great Barrier Reef, and other locales.  We are in the process of engineering these proteins to create new probes for the detection of protein phosphorylation."

Her first book, Impressionist Subjects: Gender, Interiority, and Modernist Fiction in England (Urbana: U Illinois P, 2000), examined late-19th- and early-20th-century literary impressionism; it analyzed the way representations of consciousness took up broader cultural debates about private and public spheres, which changed as middle-class women moved into public life. <br /><br />She is currently working on a book project tentatively entitled City Memories: Modernism and Urban Nostalgia. This book focuses on writing about New York City to rethink modernism\'s association of urban culture with the new. It analyzes early-twentieth-century representations of demolished buildings and vanished public spaces, to analyze the way that the city has been defined through perpetual loss. Chapters include "Urban Nostalgia and the Historical Novel," "Documentary and the City," "Public Space, Private Memory," and "Journalism and the Anecdote."'

S"My major research focus for many years has been on synaptic plasticity, the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections between neurons. Synaptic plasticity is a basic property of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and is used in distinct brain regions for neuroadapations to various environmental stimuli. My lab's work has been focused in two regions of the central nervous system and we have recently added a third: 1) the hippocampus where synaptic plasticity is required for new memory formation, 2)the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), where we have been testing the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity is an early change that occurs during stress and is essential for addiction to drugs of abuse, and 3) the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where synaptic plasticity contributes to the development of persistent pain. My lab uses electrophysiological recordings from neurons in acutely prepared slices. We have also utilized viral transfection, transgenic mice, and other tools to manipulate the protein environment in neurons to probe the roles of particular molecules in synaptic function.<br /><br />In the hippocampus, our recent work was at the circuit level, comparing synaptic plasticity at hippocampal excitatory synapses on excitatory pyramidal cells and on inhibitory interneurons. The two behave entirely differently in response to the same afferent stimulation. In 1997 my lab discovered a form of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at excitatory synapses onto interneurons. Our recent work demonstrated the surprising requirement for TRPV1 channels in LTD. TRPV1 is an ion channel activated by noxious heat and capsaicin (the pungent ingredient in chili peppers) - and can also be activated by endogenous brain lipids. Ours was the first report that any TRP channel is required directly for synaptic plasticity. <br /><br />My lab has been one of the first to examine the relationship between synaptic plasticity and drugs of abuse. We and others have found that after even a single exposure to a drug of abuse in vivo, synapses in the VTA are potentiated. Amphetamine produces this potentiation within two hours of administration, consistent with an LTP-like mechanism. We have also demonstrated that a form of LTD at the same synapses is entirely blocked by brief exposure in vitro to low doses of amphetamine. We believe that the block of LTD by psychostimulant drugs may promote LTP of the same synapses and contribute to the development of addiction. <br /><br />We currently have two major directions in the VTA. First, we have discovered an entirely novel form of plasticity at VTA synapses. Little has previously been known about plasticity of inhibitory GABAergic synapses, and indeed many inhibitory synapses do not exhibit plasticity like their excitatory neighbors. We now find that inhibitory GABAergic VTA synapses express robust LTP mediated by an entirely novel intracellular signaling cascade. This LTPGABA is entirely blocked by morphine, suggesting a novel site of action for this drug in the reward circuit. Our recent work demonstrated that not only morphine but also other abused drugs and a brief stressor block LTPGABA and potentiate excitatory synapses. We know that stress can precipitate drug-seeking in animals that have undergone drug withdrawal, suggesting the idea that when LTPGABA is blocked (by stress), an individual may be more likely to relapse to drug use. We are working to understand how brief stress causes this alteration in the VTA and to define its relationship to addiction.<br /><br />We have recently begun work characterizing synaptic plasticity at synapses between afferents carrying pain information and neurons in slices of spinal cord. We plan to examine different dorsal horn neurons to see which cells are involved, and we will also test synaptic function in slices from models of neuropathic pain.<br /><br />Overall, our work in synaptic plasticity demonstrates that multiple signaling pathways are utilized at various CNS synapses to bring about changes in synaptic strength. Furthermore, our work in the reward system underlines the idea that changes in synaptic strength contribute to neuroadaptations of many brain systems beyond those used to store memory per se. The interactions of drugs of abuse and of pain fibers with LTP and LTD mechanisms illustrate this idea: distinct environmental inputs may modify or perturb existing CNS systems to bring about long-lasting behavioral changes. My work thus is relevant both at the basic level, describing the building blocks of the nervous system, and at the translational level, suggesting targets for therapeutics that may enhance memory or combat addiction or chronic pain."

S'Karl Kelsey, M.D., a new professor of community health, brings a unique set of skills to these questions. Kelsey is a molecular biologist who studies substances in blood or tissue that signal that cancer is present or progressing. Kelsey has identified several of these disease-flagging features, known as biomarkers, for breast, lung and other cancers.<br /><br />But Kelsey doesn\'t stop in the lab. He takes the knowledge gained there and applies it to people, overseeing large studies that compare people with cancer to a very similar group of people without cancer. Then Kelsey and colleagues study the medical and lifestyle histories of people in each group to learn what factors may have caused them to get sick. His work has led to critical and sometimes surprising findings, such as the role human papilloma virus has in increasing risk for head and neck cancers.<br /><br />Kelsey also studies how toxic substances behave in the body, influencing gene activity and forming tumors in ways that differ from tumors created by genetic defects. For example, on the cellular level, the lung cancer tumor of a smoker looks different from the lung cancer tumor of a nonsmoker.<br /><br />"I like taking basic biology tools and knowledge and applying them to people," he said. "This combination of science and medicine suits me."'

S"Dr. Karl Kelsey, MD, MOH, is Professor of Community Health and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Brown University.  He is Director of the Center for Environmental Health and Technology, home to the Brown University Superfund Basic Research Program.  Dr. Kelsey is interested in the application of laboratory-based biomarkers in environmental disease, with experience in chronic disease epidemiology and tumor biology. The goals of his work include a mechanistic understanding of individual susceptibility to exposure-related cancers. In addition, his laboratory is interested in tumor biology, investigating somatic alterations in tumor tissue from patients who have developed exposure-related cancers. This work involves using an epidemiologic approach to characterize epigenetic and genetic alteration of genes in the causal pathway for malignancy. Active work includes several studies of individual susceptibility to cancer. Dr. Kelsey's laboratory is investigating susceptibility to smoking-related lung cancer, studying multi-racial and ethnic populations. In addition, the laboratory is also studying inherited susceptibility to brain tumors and pancreatic cancer. Major case control studies that are ongoing in the laboratory include studies designed to understand inherited and acquired susceptibility in head and neck cancers. The laboratory is also involved in a case control study of asbestos-associated mesothelioma, and arsenic exposure, cigarette smoking and bladder cancer. Considerable work is being devoted to understanding the mechanisms of action of both asbestos and arsenic including their ability to effect promoter methylation and gene silencing in carcinogenesis. Recent work in the laboratory includes an interest in reproductive outcomes; Professor Kelsey has partnered with Dr. Stephen Buka (Epidemiology Division Head in the Department of Community Health) and Dr. Maureen Phipps (Director of the Brown University/Women & Infants Hospital National Center of Excellence in Women's Health) to initiate a Rhode Island birth cohort, now termed the Generations Project. Dr. Kelsey received his MD from the University of Minnesota and Masters of Occupational Health from Harvard University."

Before arriving at Brown, she was at Harvard Medical School where her original focus was on developing innovative approaches for investigating placebo effects. In 2006, she received a K01 award  from the NIH to investigate attention, somatosensory cortical dynamics and mindfulness, resulting in numerous publications including a report (Kerr, Jones, et al 2011) on the  effects of mindfulness meditation on the ability to use attention to regulate a localized measure of cortical responsiveness (alpha rhythms recorded in primary somatosensory cortex). In 2011, she joined the Department of Family Medicine and the Contemplative Studies Initiative (for which she is Director of Translational Neuroscience) at Brown University. Her work has been published in Journal of Neuroscience, BMJ, Brain Research Bulletin and other journals, and has been covered in the New York Times, Technology Review and Forbes.'

S'Daniel Y. Kim\'s primary research field is 20th-century U. S. literature with a particular focus on the Asian American and African American traditions, ethnic studies, gender studies, and the Cold War.<br /><br />He is the author of <i>Reading Manhood in Black and Yellow: Ralph Ellison, Frank Chin and the Literary Politics of Identity</i> (Stanford University Press, 2005). This book examines literary representations of racialized masculinity, and it is the first study to do so in a comparative &#150; African-American and Asian-American &#150; context. Through detailed analyses of two exemplary figures, it identifies a gendered and sexualized rhetoric that both black and Asian male writers have drawn upon to depict the violent psychic effects of white racism on men of color; it also brings into focus the persistent and seductive belief that the domain of literature provides a measure of mobility from the repressive constructions of minority identity that prevail in a racist order. This study &#150; like much recent work that has been generated at the intersections of feminist, gender, gay/lesbian and ethnic studies &#150; illuminates the intimate relationship between the various modalities of identity that exert an essentializing power in the production of modern subjectivity: race, gender and sexuality. Its particular contributions to this body of work stem from its comparative scope and the specific emphasis it places on literary ideology &#150; its exploration of how a sexual and racial politics of identity becomes articulated as a literary politics.<br /><br />He is currently working on a book provisionally titled <i>The Korean War in Color</i>. In it he examines US cultural representations of the Korean War in an interracial and transnational framework, focusing on depictions of Asians, Asian Americans and African Americans. One of its primary aims is to work against the seeming historical erasure of this event by returning us to a range of texts from the 1950s (novels, films and journalistic accounts), thereby bringing into focus the watershed role that the war played in the framing of dominant liberal narratives of race and empire. This study also addresses the psychic and political issues raised by recent American authors (Clarence Adams, Susan Choi, Chang-rae Lee, John A. Williams) whose works suggest the afterlife of this conflict in American articulations of race.<br /><br />There are two parts to this study, the first of which focuses on texts from the 1950s. Emergent in the films, novels and journalistic texts I examine are two larger cultural narratives that comprise the dominant interpretive framework for the war. These I call screen narratives, for they provide a kind of screen onto which the war\'s events are projected, framing certain explanatory possibilities while screening off others. The first I address in chapter one: It interprets the conflict as being about the domestic problem of black-white race relations, and it takes shape in popular texts that emphasize this war as the first fought by a wholly integrated military. Chapter 2 addresses the second screen narrative which emerges in a sizable body of popular cultural works from the 1950s that center on the Japanese and Japanese Americans. I suggest how these texts attempt to manage racial anxieties that were exacerbated by the Korean War, an event that radically disrupted the relatively stable Orientalism of an earlier war. This cultural narrative ends up recapitulating a prior erasure: the period of the Occupation, when all Korean subjects were regarded by the United States as legal subjects of the Japanese Empire.<br /><br />Part II turns to the strategies of remembrance (and non-remembrance) that structure the novels of Susan Choi, Nora Okja Keller, Chang-rae Lee. These recent texts all engage with the two screen narratives I refer to above, suggesting their continuing cultural presence. I show this influence to be, however, both disabling and productive. The third chapter reads how their novels engage with the black-white racial binary that played a crucial role in the national process of forgetting the Korean War; the fourth examines how they suggest the continuation of a pattern whereby "Korea" is only legible through an association with "Japan." I demonstrate how the persistent influence of these screen narratives &#150; which can suggest the erasure of Korean or Korean-American concerns &#150; can also facilitate the emergence of a powerfully expansive and novel script for telling the story of how present identity might be shaped by past trauma. For the Korean-American narrative script emergent from these novels is a motley one &#150; stitched together from narrative conventions that have been associated with other racial groups &#150; and therein lies its capacity to gesture toward a much more expansive and agile sense of political subjectivity than might emerge from a more monologic and monoracial remembering of the Korean War.<br /><br />The book opens with an introduction that lays out the conception of cultural memory it elaborates: one that draws from Holocaust studies and African-American studies. It engages most extensively with Marianne Hirsch\'s conception of postmemory, which refers to a second-generation cultural memory belonging not so much to the surviving witnesses of past atrocities, but to their descendants; postmemory also signifies a collective relation to past suffering that moves away from ossified conceptions of ethnic identity toward ones that are more ethically supple. The book closes with an analysis of the works of Mexican-American author and Korean War veteran Rolando Hinojosa. His writings make visible the nexus of imperial endeavors that have shaped U.S. racial politics, both domestically and internationally, by drawing parallels between the violently imposed borders that are the legacy of U.S. imperialism in the Americas and in Asia.'

S"[1] Iron-Sulfur Clusters in NO Signaling.   <br />Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is involved in cell-cell communication, blood pressure regulation, neurotransmission, and antimicrobial activity, as well as pathologic effects such as DNA damage.  Over the past ten years, several iron-sulfur containing regulatory proteins have been identified as the targets of NO, where gene transcription can be initiated upon reactions with NO.  However, at present, little is known about how this modification occurs and what the modified products are.  Using small synthetic molecules, we will elucidate the relevant chemistry of [Fe-S] clusters with NO in order to better understand a central dogma of [Fe-S] mediated NO signaling.<br /><br />[2] Carbon Dioxide Reduction.  <br />Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an excellent source of carbon and nature has ways to use it very wisely, e.g., production of glucose from CO2 by plants.  However, an increased amount of CO2 can act as a harmful green house gas, much of which is constantly produced in urban countries, causing serious environmental problems.  Inspired by metalloenzymes' structures and functions in dealing with CO2, we are developing biomimetic catalysts, i.e., synthetic compounds which can mimic the functions of enzymes, which can convert CO2 to useful forms of fuels such as methane and methanol."

S'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major primary malignant tumor of the liver.  Although viral etiological factors have been identified, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to tumor progression during hepatocarcinogenesis remain largely unknown.  There is increasing evidence that alteration of the Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway is a common early event in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and is associated with tumor development and/or progression.  Recently, we have made several observations: 1) a specific human Frizzled 7 (FZD7) receptor was overexpressed in human HCC cell lines, tumor samples, and HCC tumors derived from transgenic models.  The expression levels of FZD7 were functionally correlated with increased cell motility and invasion.  In addition, accumulation and nuclear translocation of &#223;-catenin was observed in HCC cell lines and tumor samples as the result of FZD7 overexpression.  2) Up-regulation of FDZ7 was also associated with downstream activation of this pathway in both dysplastic tissue and tumors.  3) More importantly, we have recently identified human Wnt-3 and Wnt-11 as the probable natural ligands for FDZ7 receptors.  These findings suggest that up-regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway contributes to the development of HCC.  Moreover, identification of Wnt-3 and Wnt-11 provides an opportunity to study general molecular mechanisms involved in murine and human hepatocarcinogenesis.  Based on our findings we are currently focusing on 1) the role of Wnt pathway activation during hepatocarcinogenesis, 2) Wnt ligand expression and subsequent activation of downstream components of the &#223;-catenin pathway in human tumors, adjacent dysplastic tissue, and uninvolved liver, 3) determining if blocking Wnt ligand action has anti-tumor effects in animal models of hepatocarcinogenesis, 4) the expression profile of FZD receptors and the mechanisms of the canonical Wnt pathway activation in HCC, 5) TCF transcriptional factor isotypes and their target gene(s) in HCC.  Since the identification of secreted Wnt ligands and how they signal through FZD7 receptors to downstream components is unknown, the relative contributions of canonical versus non-canonical pathways to HCC tumor formation may now be explored in some detail.  These investigations may provide novel molecular targets for this devastating disease.'

S"Professor Kimia's research interests are in the areas of computer vision, image processing, medical imaging, perception, and psychophysics. A focus of his program is the problem of object recognition from shape. Free-form shape is represented by the geometry of its skeletal structure and the dynamics of flow of singularities along it-together referred to as the shock set. A natural grouping of shocks gives rise to a hierarchy represented as a graph, thus translating the recognition problem into graph matching. Notions of edit-distance in the shape space, categorization of shapes into classes, and their representation by a prototype or exemplar play a key role in successful indexing by shape into large image databases.  Medical imaging is another focus of this research program. Three-dimensional datasets from computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) and other modalities are analyzed to extract relevant medical structure (segmentation), to register images over different scans, different modalities, and different patients (registration), for treatment follow-up, to create computational atlases, etc. The visualization and measurement of these structures can provide key clinical information to the physician.  The generalization of the 2D shape representation to 3D is significant in applications requiring a notion of surfaces and volumes. We have classified the local forms of the 3D shock set, and the central skeletal sheets representing object symmetry. The mathematical classification of the transitions of the shock set order deformation is now established [Giblin-Kimia] in 2D but is open in 3D. Shape is completely reconstructable from its shock set, leading to a growth model of shape. We have built a language and a framework for creating and editing 2D free form and are now exploring its extension to the design of 3D form objects.  Digital color halftoning is the problem of arranging colored dots, as produced by a modern printer (laser, inkjet, thermal, etc.) such that the perceptual effect is that of a continuous tone image, e.g., a photograph. This project involves the use of mathematical techniques in image processing, an understanding of the industrial use of color, and an examination of the perception of halftones."

The large sample validity of statistical inference is, however, often a misconception for economic models that contain endogenous variables. Endogeneity is a commonality of many economic variables. Kleibergen is involved in the development of statistical procedures that remain trustworthy in such instances."

Professor Knopf ascended the academic ladder, earning tenure in 1975, full Professor in 1978, and being named in 1992 as the first Charles A. and Helen B. Stuart Professor of Medical Science.  He was the first chairman of the newly created Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology in 1994 and served until 1997.  In 1998 Prof. Knopf was honored as "Teacher of the Year" (Life Sciences, Brown University) for his teaching undergraduate courses in Immunology.  He currently holds the title of C.A. & H.B. Stuart Emeritus Professor of Medical Science.  <br /><br />Among his research awards, he has received an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation travel grant to conduct research at Max-Planck-Institute fur Molekular Genetik, Dr. Fritz Melchers\' lab, Berlin, Germany (1969); a Fulbright Fellowship (1978-1979) to conduct research in Dr. Graham F. Mitchell\'s lab, Melbourne, Australia; and a Fogarty Fellowship (1986-1987) for research in Dr. Diane McLaren\'s lab, London, England, and Dr. Donato Cioli\'s lab, Rome, Italy.  He maintained continuous grant support from 1966-2001 for his research from NIH-NIAID, Rockefeller Foundation, E. M. Clark Foundation, World Health Organization, NIH-NS, Multiple Sclerosis Society, American Cancer Society, and The Brain Tumor Society; plus local grants from the Rhode Island Foundation and Brown University (Solomon Award). <br /><br />Professor Knopf has conducted basic science research in protein biosynthesis (hemoglobin and immunoglobulin, IgG); surface expression and secretion of IgG; development of humoral immunity to infection by the parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni; blocks in schistosome development in nonpermissive hosts; immune privilege in the brain; behavioral changes induced in rats by micro-infusion of antibodies to brain cell proteins.  Among his major contributions are: <ol><br /><li>Co-discovery (and naming) of polyribosomes (or polysomes, for short) as the functional unit in hemoglobin synthesis in rabbit reticulocytes.</li><br /><li>Development and first reporting of the reticulocyte lysate cell-free protein synthesizing system plus using exogenous mRNA as the template.</li><br /><li>Contributing to the understanding of IgG biosynthesis by demonstrating that the variable and constant region segments of the molecule are not synthesized on separate templates despite being encoded in separate genetic loci on the same chromosome, requiring a process for uniting the genetic information; and delineating the intacellular process leading to secretion and surface localization of IgG.</li><br /><li>Demonstrating that an excess of schistosomula (migrating larval schistosomes) are trapped in the lungs of previously infected rats, and not the skin (as proposed in the then existing reinfection paradigm of immunity), by using a passive immunization protocol on different days post reinfection, later confirmed by a radiolabelled worm migration assay.</li><br /><li>Identification of candidate vaccine antigens and cloning of a schistosome gene by differential screening using antisera from resistant and nonresistant rat strains of the same species.</li><br /><li>Demonstrating that protein antigens introduced into the rat brain lateral ventricle (by micro-infusion via an indwelling cannula after healing of the BBB [blood-brain barrier]) induce a strong humoral immune response, mainly through stimulation of cervical lymph nodes that received antigen exiting the brain by existing fluid drainage along channels leading to cranial nerves.</li><br /><li>These and related studies on survival or rejection of a brain tumor allograph redefined immune privilege as induction of a Th2 response-dominance that muted/suppressed Th1-induced cell-mediated (CTL) anti-tumor responses; similar immunosuppressive responses were demonstrated using the rat EAE model and then exposing such immunized rats to a standard EAE challenge.</li><br /><li>Demonstrating that micro-infusion of antibodies behind an intact BBB cross-reactive with brain cell antigens can lead to behavioral changes on locomotive activity.</li><br /><li>Investigating the possible role of complement fragment C3d as the source of co-signal 2 in the primary humoral immune response that stimulates naive B cells to multiply and differentiate.</li><br /></ol>'

S'As an immunologist, I am intrigued by how the immune system responds to challenges. I first took an interest in biology as an undergraduate majoring in physics at MIT. After going on to receive a doctorate in biophysics from MIT, I completed post-doctoral training at the Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Biology in England, and the Salk Institute. I came to Brown in 1972.'

S'Dr. Knopik\'s primary area of interest is the joint effects of genetic and environmental (specifically prenatal and early postnatal) risk factors on childhood externalizing behavior and associated learning and cognitive deficits.  In 2002 and 2003, she was recognized as a finalist for the Enoch Gordis Research Recognition Award by the Research Society for Alcoholism for some of her work in this area.  In 2004, Dr. Knopik was awarded a NIDA-funded K01 award entitled, "Externalizing Behavior:  Genetics x Prenatal Nicotine," in which she examines externalizing behavior in siblings discordant for prenatal nicotine exposure.  This study is a quantitative and molecular genetics study designed to investigate the role of prenatal nicotine exposure in the etiology of externalizing behavior and to identify genes (both maternal and offspring) that may affect childhood outcomes of substance use during pregnancy.  <br /><br />An R01 offshoot of the above project entitled, Prenatal Tobacco Exposure:  Effects on Neuropsychological Outcomes and ADHD" was funded in September 2008.  This is a large family study designed to consider the role of pre- and postnatal tobacco exposure on child and adolescent neuropsychological outcomes, such as executive function, language, memory, as well as ADHD.<br />&#9;<br />Dr. Knopik was also awarded a NIAAA-funded pilot project grant in 2004 entitled, "ADHD in Children of Mothers Who Smoked during Pregnancy:  Does the Effect Interact with Paternal Alcoholism?" This pilot study will assess relative effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on ADHD in 200 \'high genetic risk\' children (100 sibling pairs with alcoholic fathers) and 200 \'low genetic risk\' children (100 sibling pairs with no history of paternal alcoholism).  Thus, the samples are chosen for environmental risk for ADHD from the maternal side (maternal smoking during pregnancy) and genetic risk for ADHD from the paternal side (those with history of DWI/alcohol problems).'

S'PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH EXPLORING ETIOLOGIC ISSUES IN MENTAL ILLNESS<br />1.&#9;Stress, trauma and health: I have conducted research and continue to do so in a number of aspects of this issue with an epidemiological focus. <br /><br />A.&#9;Natural Disasters: In 1990 (Kohn and Levav 1990) I wrote a review of the literature on this issue and provided a model on how to conceptualize this issue, which has been updated recently following work on Hurricane Mitch, a category 5 hurricane that impacted on Central America (Kohn R, Levav I, Donaire Garcia I, Machuca E, and Tamashiro R 2003; Kohn R, Levav I, Donaire Garcia I, Machuca E and Tamashiro R 2005).  In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, I conducted a household survey of 800 adults and 200 children from high and low impacted neighborhoods.  In an analysis of those aged 15 and older we found that 10.6% developed PTSD in the two months following the disaster.  The risk was highest for women and those with the greatest exposure to the hurricane.  Individual exposure was a better predictor than residing in a high impact area.  In addition we found that the elderly had a similar risk of developing PTSD (Kohn R, Levav I, Donaire Garcia I, Machuca E, and Tamashiro R 2005).  Data on the children is currently being analyzed.  In addition, a two-year follow-up study was conducted and that data is under analysis.<br /><br />B.&#9;Terrorism: Two studies have been conducted on terrorism.  One examines exposure to terrorism among settlers removed from the Gaza Strip in Israel and settlers in the West Bank.  An initial report on anticipatory distress prior to removal from the Gaza Strip has been published (Billig, Kohn, and Levav 2006).  This study found that those settlers had no more psychological distress than other stressed populations based on historical controls.  The data on terrorism exposure is currently being analyzed.  A follow-up study of these settlers is planned.  The other study explores the body handlers in Israel following a terrorist attack and how religion might protect them from negative psychological outcomes.  Data on this study is currently under analysis.<br /><br />C.&#9;Intergenerational effects of trauma: Using data from an earlier Israeli epidemiological study we have taken issue with previous research that has not been epidemiologically based on the question of whether children of Holocaust survivors are at an increased risk for psychopathology (Levav, Kohn, and Schwartz 1998).  The Israel epidemiological study only found an increased risk during childhood and that the risk disappeared after becoming an adult.  Further research on this issue is being revisited in my work on Hurricane Mitch.<br /><br />D.&#9;Relationships and psychological functioning: Using a representative sample of American couples from the National Survey of Family and Households (n = 6,451), greater depressive levels of depressive symptomatology based on the CES-D were associated with increased levels of physical victimization (Zlotnick, Kohn, Peterson, and Pearlstein 1998).  Interestingly there were no significant interactions involving gender.  The rate of physical victimization in this study was low, 4.3% in this national sample.  A five-year follow-up of those who were victims of intimate partner violence from that study showed that those with intimate partner violence were at greater risk for depressive symptoms, functional impairment, lower self-esteem, and less life satisfaction (Zlotnick, Johnson, and Kohn 2006).  This line of research is continued with secondary analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey where we showed that respondents with current major depression had fewer positive interactions with their spouse and reported more negative interactions (Zlotnick, Kohn, Keitner, and Della Grotta 2000).  Earlier I was involved in several studies that examined issues of family functioning and the outcome of major depression (Keitner, Ryan, Miller, Kohn, and Epstein 1991; Keitner, Ryan, Miller, Kohn, Bishop and Epstein 1995).<br /><br />E.&#9;Interviewing traumatized populations: In a study of Holocaust survivors compared to a non-Holocaust population the acceptability of telephone interviews involving mental health surveys was demonstrated (Fenig, Levav, Kohn, and Yelin 1993).<br /><br />F.&#9;Do stressful life events result in poorer health outcomes?  To examine this issue I completed a study on the risk of stress and the development of cancer (Levav, Kohn, Iscovich, Abramson, Tsai, and Vigdorovich 2000).  This was a cohort study of 6,284 Israelis who lost an adult son either due to war or an accident between 1970 and 1977.  This cohort and the general Israeli population of 1973 matched for similar demographic variables were followed for 20 years.  In this study we showed that the only increased risk for cancer were in hematopetic tumors (leukemias and lymphomas), supporting a psychoneurohumoral hypothesis.  In the future I plan to take this study a few steps further, to examine whether surviving a prior major stressful life event (the Holocaust) can protect/immunize or enhance the risk of developing cancer or other adverse medical outcomes.<br /><br />2.&#9;Immigration and Mental Health: <br />A.&#9;To explore the role of the host country in influencing positive or negative mental health outcomes on immigrants, I conducted a study on Soviet immigrants to the United States and Israel (Flaherty, Kohn, Golbin, Gaviria, and Birz 1986; Flaherty, Kohn, Levav, and Birz 1988).  274 immigrants were interviewed in two neighborhoods in Chicago using a quota sampling method and 412 immigrants in Israel by stratified random sampling from immigrant roles in two cities, Jerusalem and Beersheva.  Both groups completed the PERI-Demoralization Scale, the Social Network Inventory, and the Rotter\'s internal/external locus of control.  This study found that&#151;after adjusting for age, gender, marital status, place of origin in the former Soviet Union, and number of years in the host country&#151;those immigrating to Israel were significantly less demoralized despite that the fact that those immigrating to the USA were financially better off.  Having a Jewish identity seemed to decrease demoralization and enhance social networks.  We hypothesized that the differences were due to decreased marginalization, greater acceptance of the immigrant, and stronger social ties in Israel.  This study also found that it took approximately seven years after immigrating for levels of demoralization to drop substantially.<br /><br />B.&#9;In addition, two other studies were conducted with these samples.  First, in the USA sample, I explored the role of somatization in 55 older immigrants using the SCL-90 (Kohn, Flaherty, and Levav 1989).  When compared to a depressed sample the Soviet immigrants had significantly higher scores on the somatization subscale and significantly lower scores on the depression subscale than the depressed sample and higher rates of distress than normal general population controls.  This study suggested that expressing depression through somatic complaints may be culturally and social specific.  The second study was one of mental health attitudes and practices among the Soviet immigrants using case vignettes and examining help-seeking patterns conducted in Israel (Levav, Kohn, Flaherty, Lerner, and Aisenberg 1990).  The purpose of the study was two fold: 1) to provide a proxy window at that time to Soviet psychiatry and 2) to allow those working with the immigrants to gain a better understanding of their attitudes toward mental illness.  The immigrants were able to detect abnormal behavior, but did not label it as psychopathology.  The overall tolerance for abnormal behavior was low.  Their attitudes about mental illness or the mentally ill did not change with time and was not influenced by reported abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.<br /><br />C.&#9;Research in immigration and mental health has continued by examining immigrant groups in Rhode Island.  A small study looking at family functioning among Azorean Portuguese immigrants to the United States and Brazil is being submitted for publication.  Another study on Liberian immigrants, stress, and PTSD is being analyzed.  A number of review articles on immigration have also been published (Ekbald, Kohn, and Jansson 1998; Kohn 2002; Kohn in press).<br /><br />3.&#9;Gender and Major Depression: By examining affective illness in Jews I was able to provide support for the hypothesis that the gender differences in major depression could be attributed to alcohol abuse/dependence in men (Levav, Kohn, Golding, and Weissman 1997).  Secondary data analysis was conducted on the Epidemiological Catchment Area study using the Los Angeles and New Haven sites.  Rates for major depression were found to be significantly higher for Jewish men compared to Catholics or Protestants (12.5% vs. 5.4%), while rates for alcohol abuse/dependence were significantly inversed (2.8% vs. 14.1%).  There were no significant differences between females.  As a matter of fact, the rate for Jewish men were similar to Jewish women, 1.0:1 instead of the 2.1:1 found in the other groups.  The results suggested that societies that have sanctions against developing alcohol abuse/dependence seem to have similar rates of major depression in both men and women.  Therefore if men do not have the avenue to develop alcohol abuse/dependence there will be no gender difference in major depression.  Another piece of evidence in this study to support such a hypothesis was that in the more acculturated site, Los Angeles, the men had lower rates of major depression, higher rates of alcohol abuse/dependence, and a greater gender difference in major depression than New Haven.  To provide further support for the idea that Jews do have a higher rate of affective disorders historically and it was not limited to this one study, I conducted a meta-analysis of the literature dating back into the 1800\'s (Kohn, Levav, Zolendek, and Richter 1999).  43 studies were found that could be analyzed using Cohen\'s d statistic for summarizing a meta-analysis and a Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratio.  Jews did have higher rates of affective disorders than non-Jews and a weak overall risk was found for males.  Further, support for the inverse relationship between alcohol abuse/dependence and major depression resulting in a 1:1 male female rate for major depression is also evident in the Israel community based epidemiological survey  (Levav, Kohn, Dohrenwend, Shrout, Skodol, Schwartz, Link, and Naveh 1993).<br /><br />4.&#9;Is the "clinician\'s illusion" a serious issue in examining etiologic issues in mental illness?  The "clinician\'s illusion" suggests that clinically based research to examine etiologic issues is flawed as it does not take into account the biased introduced by the majority of individuals who do not enter treatment settings.  In order to examine this issue I examined the ethnic risk factor for major depression in Israel.  In the first study I conducted a meta-analysis of all treatment-based studies in Israel to examine the ethnic risk for affective disorders (Kohn and Levav 1994).  Statistical reanalysis of these studies was consistent with rates being elevated for Ashkenazim.  The second study used data from the Israel epidemiological study (Kohn, Levav, Dohrenwend, Shrout, and Skodol 1997).  I compared the untreated versus the treated rates for major depression.  Ashkenazi Jews had significantly higher rates in treated settings, but in fact it was the North African Jews who had significantly higher risk for affective disorders in the community.<br /><br />5.&#9;Stigma: A small study examining whether the Hebrew term for mental illness was stigmatizing was conducted among health professionals.  The results were mixed (Levav, Shemesh, Kohn, Baidani-Auerbach, Boni, Borenstein, Dudai, Lachman, and Grinshpoon in press).  Another study, which is under analysis, examines Mayan indigenous people without access to health care, those with access to health care, and Ladinos in Guatemala to see how stigma towards mental illness differs.  In addition, this National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) study also explores schizophrenia in Mayan\'s without access to health care.  <br /><br />6.&#9;Social Selection and Social Causation: Mental illness is found more frequently among those in the lower social classes (Levav and Kohn1996; Kohn, Dohrenwend, and Mirotznik 1998; Saraceno, Levav and Kohn 2005).  I have a NARSAD grant to investigate further why those with schizophrenia are more prevalent in the lower social classes.  This study involves using the Israeli psychiatric case register and studying probands and their first-degree relatives.  In addition, this study will yield further information on cancer risk and schizophrenia, as well as mortality.<br /><br />PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION<br />1.&#9;Mental Illness in Chile: A national household mental health survey of Chile using the Composite InternationaI Diagnositic Interview was conducted.  The overall six-month prevalence of mental disorders was 19.7%.  The five most common disorders were simple phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, major depression, and alcohol dependence.  (Vicente, Rioseco, Saldivia, Kohn, and Torres 2002; Vicente, Rioseco, Saldivia, Kohn and Torres 2003; Vicente, Kohn, Rioseco, Saldivia, Baker and Torres S, 2004; Kohn, Rioseco, Saldivia, Levav and Torres S in press).  Service utilization in Chile was also investigated (Vicente, Kohn, Saldivia, Rioseco, and Torres, 2005).  Interestingly the use of native healers is not as common as originally believed.  Of those who had mental illness, 62% did not use mental health services in a six-month period, and only 5.6% used specialized services (Saldivia, Vicente, Kohn, Rioseco, and Torres 2004).  The Mapuche indigenous people were not found to be at higher risk (Vicente, Kohn, Rioseco, Saldivia, and Torres, 2005).  A number of cross national comparisons have also been conducted on the rates of mental illness using this data; Chile has lower rates than many other countries (Andrade, Caraveo-Anduaga, Berglund, Bijl R, de Graaf, Vollebergh, Dragomirecka, Kohn R et al. 2003; Bjil, de Graff, Hiripi, Kessler, Kohn et al. 2003; Kohn, Levav, Caldas de Almeida, Vicente, Andrade, Caraveo-Anduaga, Saxena, and Saraceno B 2005).  Further analysis of data from this study is underway.<br /><br />2.&#9;Mental Illness in Israel: This was a nation-wide study of a ten-year birth cohort (1949-1958) of 4,914 Israeli-born offspring of Jewish immigrants (Levav, Kohn, Dohrenwend, Shrout, Skodol, Schwartz, Link, and Naveh 1993).  A two-stage design was used with the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview as a screen, followed by all positives and a fifth of the negatives undergoing the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia administered by psychiatrists using Research Diagnostic Criteria.  The completion rate for participation was over 90%.  This study is unique in the psychiatric epidemiologic literature in three ways: it is a prototype for the two-phase design, it used a semi-structured diagnostic interview schedule administered by psychiatrists rather than lay interviewers, and it is a birth cohort which takes into account individuals who are institutionalized.  Generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder were the most common.  Alcohol and drug use disorder were exceedingly rare.  The rates for major depression were unusually similar between males and females.  Intraethnic differences in the rates of disorders were found with North African Jews having higher rates of major depression, phobic disorder, alcoholism, and drug use disorders compared to European Jews.  More recently, we conducted a study on psychological distress comparing elderly Arabs and Jews, finding the later to be at higher risk (Shemesh, Kohn, Blumstein, Geraisy, Novikov, and Levav 2006).  This household survey included 5055 respondents using the General Health Questionnaire.  Currently, I am an investigator with the Israel World Mental Health Survey.<br /><br />3.&#9;Risk of Child and Adolescent Suicide in Israel: This study examined sociodemographic correlates and temporal trends in suicide (1975 through 1989) among young Jews, Moslem Arabs, Druzes, and Christian Arabs in Israel (Kohn, Levav, Chang, Halperin, and Zadka 1997).  The number of suicides by year of death, age, gender, religion, and ethnicity were obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics.  As annual population estimates are produced in Israel, it was possible to examine risk factors by using logistic regression and plotting regression lines to examine temporal changes.  The study examined ages 0 -14, 15-17, and 18-20.  Gender, national/religious, and ethnic origin as risk factors did not follow those in adults.  Male Jews and Druzes of army age had an increased risk for suicide.  The trend of increasing risk for suicide was only found among the 15-17 year olds.  Compared to the rest of the world rates of suicide in the young are low in Israel and increasing risk for suicide in the young is only partially present.<br /><br />4.&#9;Mental Health Care in Belize: This study was a field study using anthropological and epidemiological data to determine the mental health needs and the resources available in Belize (Bonander, Kohn, Arana, and Levav 2000).  An anthropology graduate student was stationed in Belize for a period of about six months to observe the mental health system in process, and secondly I conducted a treatment prevalence study of all individuals in the private and public mental health sector.  The epidemiological arm of the study showed that 63% of individuals with schizophrenia did not receive formal mental health care, and approximately 89% of individuals with an affective disorder had no mental health contacts.  The prevalence of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use was the highest in Central America but less than in the USA.  Psychiatric nurses are the primary mechanism of all mental health care delivery, but are not yet fully accepted by medical officers or other nurses.  Alliances with traditional therapeutic resources have not been utilized.<br /><br />5.&#9;Psychological Distress in Uruguay: A household survey of 387 adults over the age of 15 found that 23% of the population had clinically significant psychological distress based on the PERI-demoralization scale and 10% had alcohol use disorders.  Risk factors for demoralization included younger age, being female, medical comorbidity, and poorer social supports (Kohn, Alterwain, Levav, Ruocco Murillo, Contrera, Carzoli, Della Grotta, and Kim 2001).  In addition, 115 children were examined for demoralization.  Emotional and behavioral problems were noted in 53% of the children.  Higher demoralization was associated with father\'s self-perception of emotional problems and mother\'s feeling of being demoralized (Kohn, Levav, Alterwain, Ruocco, Contrera, and Della Grotta. 2001).<br /><br />6.&#9;Attitudes, Ethics, and Psychiatric Practice: <br />A.&#9;Ethics in Psychiatry: Using an instrument that I developed several countries have conducted survey research on their psychiatrists around ethical issues.  The first study was conducted in Sweden (Kullgren, Jacobsson, Lyn&#246;e, Kohn, and Levav 1996, 1997).  That study, like the others, found that psychiatrists were influenced not only by the severity of a patient\'s disorder, but also family pressure.  Sexual misconduct was a frequently reported form of abuse in psychiatry.  A second study examining the treatment of blacks compared to whites in South Africa has been conducted (Szabo, Kohn, Gordon, Levav, and Hart 2000).  Other studies were conducted in Spain (Desviat Mu&#241;oz M, Gonz&#225;lez C, Gonz&#225;lez Rodr&#237;guez A, Moreno P&#233;rez A, P&#233;rez P&#233;rez E, Ponte Vel&#243;n N, Rodr&#237;guez Calv&#237;n JL, Kohn R, and Levav I 1999) and Ethiopia (Alem, Jacobsson, Lyn&#246;e, Kohn, and Kullgren 2002).  <br /><br />B.&#9;Psychiatric Treatment Post-Apartheid: Along this theme we did a study of the practice of psychiatry in South Africa post-apartheid that showed that inequality in the care of blacks remained and that overall the quality of mental health care had declined for all races (Kohn, Szabo, Gordon, and Allwood, 2004).   <br /><br />C.&#9;A number of studies have been conducted on the general population as to their attitudes about mental illness including on Soviet immigrants (Levav, Kohn, Flaherty, Lerner, and Aisenberg 1990).  A sample of 135 from general population of the island of Dominica and 67 community leaders were survey (Kohn, Sharma, Camilleri, and Levav 2000).  The community leaders which included nurses, teachers, and police officers did as poorly or worse in identifying mental illness than the general public.  A study of two kibbutzim in Israel to examine if privatization impacted attitudes and knowledge about mental illness found no effect (Levav, Shemesh, Grinshpoon, Aisenberg, Shershevsky, and Kohn 2004).  Attitudes toward corporal punishment in Israel have also been examined (Gofin, Levav, and Kohn 2004).  A sample of 1000 adults found that 57% had undergone corporal punishment while growing up.  There was skepticism that a new law banning corporal punishment would be followed among the respondents.<br /><br />7.&#9;Primary Care and Depression:  A survey of Rhode Island primary care physicians found that they had poor recognition of major depression (Penn, Boland, McCartney, Kohn, and Mulvey 1997).  A large multicenter study of 6174 patients and 107 physicians in five countries in Latin America was undertaken to see if their knowledge, attitudes and treatment were altered after undergoing a one-day training program developed by the World Psychiatric Association.  There was improvement in knowledge and attitudes but not in actual clinical practice.  There was no change in frequency of diagnosis of major depression or use of psychopharmacological agents (Valentini, Levav, Kohn, Miranda, Mello, Mello, and Ramos 2004; Levav, Kohn et al. 2005).  Additional analysis of this dataset is still being undertaken.  A similar study was conducted with nurses in Panama and showed an improvement in clinical care (Moreno, Saravanan, Levav, Kohn, and Miranda 2004).  Internationally in a meta-analysis a wide treatment gap exists in mental health (Kohn, Saxena, Levav, and Saraceno 2004).<br /><br />GERIATRIC AND NEUROPSYCHIATRY RESEARCH<br />Although my research career is doing psychiatric epidemiology, I have integrated my clinical work in geriatric psychiatry into my research agenda. <br /><br />1.&#9;Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in the Elderly: I authored the only research-based study on the presentation of OCD in the elderly (Kohn, Westlake, Rasmussen, Masland, and Norman 1997; Kohn, Yip, and Mancebo in press).  I found that elderly patients had a later age of onset compared to younger patients.  However, there were no differences in the severity of symptoms using the YBOCS.  Elderly patients did have fewer concerns about symmetry, need to know, and counting rituals.  Hand washing and fear of having sinned were more common.<br /><br />2.&#9;Caregiver Burden in Alzheimer\'s disease: I conducted a study comparing Alzheimer caregiver burden across two countries, Guatemala and USA (Salguero, Kohn, Salguero, and Marotta 1999).  The data suggested that Guatemalans have less institutional and more informal support available.  Guatemalans, however, had poorer perceived health than USA subjects, suggesting a higher level of caregiver burden.<br /><br />3.&#9;Risk for Falls in the Elderly: Two studies have been conducted: One study showed that falls on a psychiatric inpatient unit were highest for those who received ECT, had Parkinsonism, were female, received mood stabilizers, were on antiarrhythmics, and had dementia.  Those who fell also had longer length of stays (DeCarle and Kohn 2000; DeCarle and Kohn 2001).  The second, limited to ECT, suggested that increased monitoring for falls was necessary during later shifts.<br /><br />4.&#9;Course of Depression in the Elderly: Analysis of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study was conducted comparing older and younger age groups (Mueller, Kohn, Leventhal, Leon, Solomon, Coryell, Endicott, Alexopoulos, and Keller 2004).  The elderly in this 15-year follow-up study were found to have higher risk for reoccurrence.  In addition, there were no predictors for remission or recurrence for the elderly compared to younger populations.  A review updating literature on the course of depression in the elderly was recently published (Kohn and Epstein-Lubow 2006).<br /><br />5.&#9;Suicide among the Elderly: We have conducted secondary analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on self-harm and suicide.  We have found that there is an exponential function related to mortality and age (Friedmann and Kohn 2004).  Analysis of rates of suicide attempts and associated factors in the elderly is underway.<br /><br />6.&#9;Elderly Mentally Ill Homecare: Several studies have been conducted on delivering psychiatric treatment to homebound elders (Kohn, Goldsmith, Sedgwick, and Markowitz 2004).  In a study conducted in Manhattan 93 mentally ill homebound elders were followed for up to five years.  A multidisciplinary treatment team approach showed evidence of decreasing psychiatric disability.  More recently (Zelzter and Kohn, 2006), we surveyed 53 nursing and home health care agencies to evaluate how they managed behavioral problems, dementia, and undiagnosed mental illness (Kohn, Goldsmith, and Sedgwick 2002).  The data suggested a lack of psychiatric services, a reluctance to address behavioral problems, and a failure to identify undiagnosed illness.<br /><br />PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING<br />1.&#9;Psychiatry Residents and Hospital Strikes: Given that hospital strikes were an increasing phenomena affecting psychiatry residents, I took advantage of several situations that presented at Butler Hospital to examine this issue (Kohn and Wintrob 1991; Kohn and Wintrob 1997).  Both studies showed that older residents behaved more like attendings and that younger residents sympathized more with those on strike.'

S'We hypothesize that targeting of channels to particular membrane microdomains and their organization in macromolecular complexes allow cells to increase the efficiency of their response to extracellular signals.  We plan to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and turnover of Kv1.5 and KV2.1 potassium channels in the heart.  We will characterize the macromolecular complex (channelosome) that modulates the function of a delayed rectifier potassium channel, Kv1.5.  To this end, we will use a combination of biochemical and molecular tools, patch-clamp analyses, and in vivo mouse models to determine the mechanisms that regulate trafficking of Kv1.5 polypeptide to caveolae, specifically to characterize the interactions between Kv1.5 and caveolin-3 (Cav-3) and SAP97.  In addition, we plan to examine the role of posttranslational modifications on the trafficking, assembly, and stability on Kv1.5/Cav-3/SAP97 macromolecular complex.  We will map the site of interactions between SAP97 and Cav-3 and prove that this interaction contributes to the targeting of Kv1.5 to caveolae.  We also plan to study a second voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv2.1).  We plan to characterize the role of N-terminal cysteines of Kv2.1 and their posttranslational modifications in regulating the assembly, trafficking, and gating of Kv2.1.  The work outlined in this application should greatly increase our understanding of the regulation of expression of Kv1.5 and Kv2.1.<br /><br />Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is associated with delayed cardiac repolarization, prolonged QT intervals, recurrent syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death.  Since mouse models for both LQT1 and LQT2 have failed to mimic the arrhythmias in human LQT1 and LQT2, we created transgenic rabbit models deficient in voltage gated potassium channels (IKs and IKr) by overexpressing either KvLQT1-Y315S in the heart in order to attenuate IKs, or HERG-G628S to attenuate IKr. We next plan to analyze and compare the phenotype of these models with surface ECG; monitoring of alert, free-moving rabbits; and programmed electrical stimulation (PES) of the right ventricle of anesthetized rabbits. In addition, we plan to characterize the biochemical and electrophysiological phenotype of rabbit cardiomyocytes derived from the epicardial, mid-myocardial, and endocardial layers of the left ventricle of KvLQT1-Dn and ERG-DN rabbits.  Specifically, to characterize and compare the expression of native potassium channel polypeptides, the APDs, the inward and outward potassium currents, and the inward calcium currents expressed in these cardiomyocytes.  We will evaluate the effect of the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and transmural distribution of transmembrane action potential characteristics across the ventricular wall in KvLQT1-DN and ERG-DN rabbit models using a wedge preparation.  We will assess the contribution of transmural electrical heterogeneity induced by isoproterenol to the development of long QT intervals, broad-based T waves, transmural dispersion of repolarization, and the development of spontaneous as well as programmed electrical stimulation (PES)-induced TdP in the two models.  These rabbits will likely provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie the ventricular arrhythmias and the electrical remodeling detected in LQT1 and LQT2. These models may also enable drug screening for acquired LQTS, and the development of gene therapy for congenital LQTS.'

S'My research program is aimed at the understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias.  Our approach involves three main lines of investigation: 1) Elucidation of transcriptional program(s) that regulate the expression of membrane polypeptides involved in determining the duration of cardiac action potential; 2) Investigation of the trafficking and localization of voltage-gated potassium channels in the heart; and 3) Creation of genetically modified animal models for studying sudden cardiac death.'

S'Professor Krause\'s first book,  <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/KRALIB.html">Liberalism with Honor</a> (Harvard University Press, 2002), explores the sources of spirited -- but principled -- political action in liberal democratic societies.  Why do men and women sometimes risk their necks to defend their liberties?  What motivates principled opposition to the abuse of power? <i>Liberalism with Honor</i> shows the sense of honor to be an important source of such action and a spring of individual agency more generally. Although often dismissed as a vestige of old world aristocracy, honor still matters for liberal democratic societies today and is an important support for individual freedom.  It combines self-concern with principled higher purposes and so challenges the disabling dichotomy between self-interest and self-sacrifice that currently pervades both political theory and American public life. Moreover, while most of the time liberal democracy can get by with good citizens, occasionally it needs great ones -- men and women of unusual courage and extraordinary ambition who distinguish themselves by rising (when others will not) to the spirited defense of individual liberties.<br /><br />Professor Krause\'s second book, <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8814.html">Civil Passions</a> (Princeton University Press, 2008), examines the relationship between reason and passion within political judgment and public deliberation. Must we put passions aside when we deliberate about justice?  Can we do so? The dominant views of deliberation rightly emphasize the importance of impartiality as a cornerstone of fair decision-making, but they wrongly assume that impartiality means being disengaged and passionless. <i>Civil Passions</i> argues that moral and political deliberation necessarily incorporate passions, even as it insists on the value of impartiality. Drawing on resources ranging from Hume\'s theory of moral sentiment to recent findings in neuroscience, the book offers a systematic account of how passions can generate an impartial standpoint for deliberating about justice. This new account of affective but impartial judgment requires us to reconceive the meaning of public reason, the nature of sound deliberation, and the authority of law. It also demands a fundamental rethinking of who we are, both as citizens and as persons. By illuminating how impartiality <i>feels,</i><i>Civil Passions</i> offers not only a truer account of how we deliberate about justice but one that promises to engage citizens more effectively in acting for justice. <a href="http://www.rorotoko.com/index.php/article/sharon_krause_book_interview_civil_passions_moral_sentiment_deliberation/">More on Civil Passions</a><br /><br />Professor Krause\'s current book project, <i>Freedom Beyond Sovereignty</i>, asks the question: What does it mean to be free? The informal constellations of power manifest in racism, sexism, religiously-based discrimination, and other norms that perpetuate systematic relations of domination and oppression pose a serious challenge to individual freedom today, even in ostensibly free societies such as the U.S. To meet this challenge effectively, we need a better understanding of the complex dynamics of human agency that underlie freedom. This book develops a view of human agency that diverges sharply from the usual accounts of agency in liberal political theory today, which associate agency with mastery and sovereign control. The model of agency as sovereignty obscures from view the deep and disabling conflicts that plague the agency of politically oppressed and socially marginalized persons. If agency is non-sovereign, however, it is not impotent. History shows that human beings do have the capacity to act in ways that not only break with existing relations of power but sometimes even change them. The existence of political activists such as Martin Luther King, Jr. or Aung San Suu Kyi demonstrates human agency\'s ability to generate novel aspirations and to affect the world in unexpected ways. <i>Freedom Beyond Sovereignty</i> combines a philosophical theory of agency with perspective gleaned from empirical literatures on social movements and political mobilization. It aims to advance knowledge of the foundations of human freedom, and to illuminate the social, political, and personal conditions necessary to make freedom real for a wider range of persons.'

S'Born in New York City, educated at Yale (B.A.), Oxford (B.Litt.) and Harvard (Ph.D.), Shepard Krech III is professor of anthropology and environmental studies, and director of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, at Brown University. He has received major fellowships and grants from the National Humanities Center (twice), Woodrow Wilson International Center, NEH, Canadian Embassy, and Wenner-Gren Foundation. He has written over 150 essays and reviews, lectured widely, and is the author or editor of 11 books and monographs, including Praise the Bridge That Carries You Over; Indians, Animals and the Fur Trade; A Victorian Earl in the Arctic; The Subarctic Fur Trade; Collecting Native America, 1870-1960; The Ecological Indian (1999); Encyclopedia of World Environmental History (ed. with J. R. McNeill and C. Merchant, 2004), Spirits of the Air (2009); and Indigenous Environments (MS ed. with David Gordon). <br /><br />The Ecological Indian: Myth and History (W. W. Norton, 1999) was discussed on radio coast-to-coast and reviewed or featured in over 100 publications in more than one dozen languages, including The New Yorker, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The New Republic, New York Review of Books, Times Literary Supplement [TLS], Chronicle of Higher Education, Times Higher Education Supplement, Der Spiegel, NRC Handelsblad, and others. Reviewers remark that the book "teaches us everything we have wanted to know about American Indians and the environment" (New York Times), is "ground-breaking and myth-busting" (Wisconsin Public Radio), and "is what good science should be" (Detroit News). The book was the subject of a session at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, a conference in Laramie, Wyoming, and the edited collection, Native Americans and the Environment (eds. M. Harkin and D. R. Lewis [U. Nebraska Press]). <br /><br />Critics refer to the three-volume Encyclopedia of World Environmental History (Routledge, 2004) as edited with "great insight and skill" (James G. Speth) and "the most ambitious effort yet to offer a comprehensive overview of the long-term history of human interactions with the natural world on a truly planetary scale" (William Cronon). <br /><br />Early comments from anthropology and environmental history on Spirits of the Air (University of Georgia Press, 2009) include "superbly researched and splendidly illustrated" (Raymond Fogelson), "insightful" (Carolyn Merchant), and "exhaustive" (Charles Hudson); and from ornithology and the professional birding world a "landmark work" (Kenn Kaufman) and "thought-provoking."

She is now taking this exploration of social identity and British visual culture into the domain of the Black Atlantic. In her recently published book, <i>Slavery, Sugar and the Culture of Refinement</i>, she examines various forms of visual imagery (natural history illustrations, genre paintings, graphic satire, topographical prints) that pertain to the colonial exchange of goods and people between Britain and its West Indian colonies. In preparation is an article on race, caricature and J. M. W. Turner\'s "Slave Ship."

S"&#149; The Hyphenated Self: Self-Esteem, Self-Enhancement, and Self-Effacement<br /><br /><br />. . . and all the children are above average. &#151;Garrison Keillor<br /><br /><br />Most people have positive self-images. According to findings from a variety of research programs, these self-images are inflated in the sense that many people irrationally enhance their egos. But no single measure is yet accepted as the best index of self-enhancement. Do people see themselves more positively than they see the average other person, do they see themselves more positively than they are seen by their peers, or do they see themselves more positively than they really are according to objective measures (e.g., test scores)? As a fourth measure, I have proposed that people self-enhance by judging their own traits&#151;whatever these might be&#151;more positively than these traits are judged by those people who do not claim to possess them (Krueger, PSPB, 1998). My colleagues and I have explored the differences and dependencies among these alternative measures (Krueger & Mueller, JPSP, 2002;  Sinha & Krueger, JRP, 1998). Just how self-enhancement is being conceptualized and measured can have surprising implications for studies seeking to understand whether this bias is beneficial or detrimental to mental health and adjustment. A psychometric analysis of this issue is under way.<br /><br /><br />Self-esteem? Nein danke?! Most people report high self-esteem (and they think their own self-esteem is higher than that of the average person). Is high self-esteem good for you, aside from the triviality that it feels good to feel good about yourself? The American Psychological Society convened a Task Force to review the literature on this question. Our report (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003) appeared in Psychological Science in the Public Interest. In short, we found that low self-esteem is associated with fewer risks and high self-esteem is associated with higher risks (e.g., aggression) than is commonly assumed. On a lighter note, you can check out an essay on why self-esteem may constitute a social dilemma when we depend on others for affirmation of our selves (George Street Journal, 2003).<br /><br />&#149; Social Projection, Categorization, and Stereotyping<br /><br /><br />We don't see things as they are; we see things as we are. &#151;The Talmud<br /><br /><br />Social projection leads to&#151;sometimes exaggerated&#151;perceptions of similarity between the self and others. This phenomenon cannot be fully understood without considering the moderating role of social categorization. Our research, and that of many others, shows that people generalize their own thoughts, behaviors, and feelings primarily to others who belong to the same social group (i.e., ingroup members). Projection to outgroups is far more limited (Clement & Krueger, JESP, 2002). This asymmetry in projection can explain the much older finding of ingroup bias. Because most people have highly favorable self-images (see above), selective projection to ingroups yields a fairly positive set of beliefs. By not reaping the benefits of projection, outgroups end up being described less positive. Currently, we are studying whether the ingroup-outgroup asymmetry in projection is further moderated by the majority or minority status of the group.<br /><br /><br />NB: Perceptions of similarity (projection) and perceptions of difference (self-enhancement) only seem to be contradictory (see Krueger, 2000, in Handbook of Social Comparison if curious).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Men are from Mars, but then, aren't we all? My current work on stereotyping focuses on the dual question of whether people overestimate gender differences in descriptions of personality (they do) and whether these perceived differences uniquely predict whether a particular attribute is perceived as typical of the target gender (not really; see  Krueger, Hasman, Acevedo, & Villano, PSPB, 2003). We are following up this work by exploring the effect of conversational norms (and violations of these) on expressions of stereotypes.<br /><br /><br />&#149; Going Overboard on Bias?<br /><br /><br />To study psychology is to study the limitations of human thought. &#151;Mick Rothbart (paraphrased)<br /><br /><br />The interest in biases and errors is characteristic of research in social psychology. Recently, I have begun to question the wisdom of equating negative, or undesirable, phenomena with interesting phenomena. My first approach to this problem has been to examine the effects of the typical study design and data analysis on substantive conclusions concerning the quality of social perception. It seems to me that in a typical study, rational (or unbiased) social perception is equated with the truth of a null hypothesis (Krueger, AP, 2001). Because most studies are designed to reject null hypotheses, rationality cannot be demonstrated in the standard paradigm. When, for example, p > .05, we do not conclude that perceptions are unbiased, but rather that (a) we cannot tell whether they are biased, that (b) we have insufficient statistical power to conclude otherwise, or that (c) our data merely contain statistical noise. Some reflections on this topic have appeared (Krueger, Psycoloquy, 1998), and a more comprehensive analysis will appear in the Behavioral and Brain Sciences (Krueger & Funder, BBS)."

S'I received a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Oregon in 1988, and I have been at Brown since 1991. My research interests focus on inductive reasoning in social context. This includes the areas of self-perception, intergroup perception and relations, as well as behavior in social dilemmas. I am particularly interested in the processes of social projection, which determine how and when people assume that others will behave as they themselves do. I have found that social projection can increase the accuracy of social perception, and make people more willing to cooperate with others. However, social projection also contributes to ingroup favoritism and conflict between groups. I regularly teach a laboratory course in social cognition (PY154). At intervals, I teach topical courses to graduate students and seminars to advanced undergraduates.'

S"Dr. K&#252;laots' research team investigates bio-wastes, which clearly pose a risk to the environment if disposed in open dumps. These carbonized biomaterials, with a high network of super-micropores, micropores and mesopores offer great opportunities for use in various environmental applications. Our early results suggest that these bio-waste chars are likely candidates for sorbent materials for few EPA top list pollutants.<br />       Dr. K&#252;laots collaborates with Dr. Suuberg in his research on oil shale byproduct semi-coke, coal combustion and coal byproduct fly ash. The majority of oil shale literature focuses on oil shale retorting processes, quantifying extractable oil, and general characteristics of the oil derived from shale. Only a scant amount of the oil shale literature focuses on the characterization of oil shale semicokes, and even less investigates semicoke organic char. The current widely used technology for oil shale oil retorting process negatively impacts environment, since it produces vast amounts of organic rich oil shale semi-coke. Most of this semi-coke ends up in open dumps, and therefore poses threat to the environment. The organic matter of this semi-coke can be as high as 18 wt-%, and the specific surface area around 550 m2/g. The question is, what can be done with this organic rich semi-coke material besides just blending it with other fuels and feeding it to municipal scale boiler systems? In addition, we are looking into oil shale semi-coke contamination with significant levels of phenols, PAHs, or harmful heavy metals.<br />&#9;Dr. K&#252;laots is also actively involved in a nanomaterial project in collaboration with Dr. Robert Hurt. At the moment, we are investigating Graphene oxide - a single atomic layer Graphite oxide. The unique physical properties of this material offer opportunities for application in a wide spectrum of energy and environment projects."

S"Professor Kumar's research interests include structure-property relationships in structural metals and alloys, intermetallics, metal-matrix composites, physical metallurgy, phase transformations in metallic materials, and deformation behavior. Current research activities focus primarily on intermetallic materials, nanocrystalline metals and alloys, refractory alloys of Molybdenum, and high-strength steels. Professor Kumar is actively researching the structure of Laves phases in Cr-based alloys and their stability as a function of temperature and composition.  In this, he has collaborated with scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory to understand the atomic structure in the core of dislocations and how the local structure may facilitate the motion of dislocations.  In the project on nanocrystalline metals and alloys, he collaborates with faculty members at MIT to understand the deformation mechanisms in these materials by employing in-situ straining techniques in the transmission electron microscope. In the project related to Molybdenum alloys (alloys for the next generation aircraft engine components), strength and crack growth resistance in monotonic and cyclic loading over the temperature range from room temperature to 1400C are being measured and the role of the underlying microstructure on the properties are being understood.  In addition, dominant deformation mechanisms are being elucidated using a combination of experiments and computations.  In yet another project, the basllistic penetration responses of novel high strength steels are being assessed and the evolution of microstructure in the dynamic deformation regime is being characterized using a range of state-of-the-art experimental techniques that include focussed Ion Beam and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. These techniques enable detailed characterization of microstructure within the narrow adaibatic shear bands and provide evidence for features that were until now hypothesized."

S'Stochastic dynamical systems, whether controlled or uncontrolled,  are ubiquitous in applications.<br /><br /> In the mid-1960s, Kushner established much of the basic theory of stochastic stability, based on the concept of supermartingales as Lyapunov functions. Extension to non-Markovian and infinite-dimensional systems followed, and he developed a full stochastic analog of the LaSalle invariance theorem, which is essential for application to distributed and delay systems. Such results, which are analogous to the theory for deterministic systems, are essential for the analysis of the long-term behavior of complex stochastic systems arising in control, economics, recursive algorithms and elsewhere. Because proof of stability is often required before any further analysis can be done, these have been fundamental tools for the analysis of stochastic systems ever since. It was Kushner who, in the mid-1960s, provided the first rigorous development of nonlinear filters for diffusion-type processes with white observation noise. This is the analog of Kalman filtering for nonlinear systems, and concerns the tracking of systems with nonlinear dynamics or observations. He also developed many practical algorithms for approximating optimal filters, adaptations of the theory for dealing with robustness and for systems that are only "approximately" Markovian or have only widebandwidth noise, as well as extensions to distributed systems.<br /><br />  Numerical methods for problems arising in stochastic control have always been a challenge. The optimal value function formally solves the Bellman-Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Even when the derivation is formally justified, the equation can be a highly nonlinear (even in the highest-order terms) elliptic or parabolic partial differential equation, an integral-differentia1 equation, or a variational inequality. The equations tend to be degenerate and to have serious singularities; moreover, the reflections on the boundaries are often not continuous. The solutions, even when they   are known to exist, might not be differentiable or even continuous. Generally, there is little theory concerning regularity or even existence. So  the use of classical numerical methods can be problematic. Kushner\'s Markov chain approximation method is the current approach of choice for such problems. The algorithms are robust; they are intuitively reasonable and have physical meaning because the approximating Markov chains represent systems similar to the one being approximated. The convergence theory is purely probabilistic, using methods of stochastic control, so that the analytical difficulties are avoided. Kushner is the author of ten  books and more than two hundred papers. In his 1984 book he developed a comprehensive approach to approximation and weak convergence methods for random processes, with emphasis on problems that arise in control and communications, e.g., systems driven by wide-band noise, perhaps appearing nonlinearly in the dynamics. The original physical models are often not Markovian; but for purposes of analysis or numerical approximation, approximation by a Markovian model is important. The book presents powerful methods for obtaining such approximations, as well as for proving stability of the original physical systems. The ideas are widely used in the analysis of stochastic recursive algorithms, for the approximation of stochastic networks under general conditions, and for obtaining "nearly optimal" controls for systems driven by wide-bandwidth noise; recently, they have been applied to the development of scheduling algorithms for mobile communications with rapidly varying connecting channels.<br /><br />  His 1990 book sets out a complete theory of singularly  perturbed stochastic control systems and nonlinear filters, with multiple time scales and white or wide-band noise processes. Most recently, his 2001 book presents a thorough development of the theory of heavy traffic analysis of both controlled and uncontrolled queueing and<br />communications systems.<br /><br /><br />With his work in stochastic approximation and recursive stochastic algorithms, Kushner put in place  a large part  of the current  framework. The theory concerns the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the paths of a large class of stochastic difference equations. Such equations model a large number of adaptive processes in control and communications, learning in neural networks, market-adjustment algorithms in economics, and processes in other settings. They are ubiquitous in current applications. Kushner established powerful methods   for the analysis of convergence and rate of convergence under very weak conditions on the noise and dynamics.'

He is a former director of that center  as well as a former chairman of the Applied Mathematics Department, and  is currently  a University Professor Emeritus.<br /><br />Since then, in ten books and well over two hundred papers, he has<br />established a substantial part of modern stochastic systems theory.<br />These include seminal developments of stochastic stability for both<br />Markovian and non-Markovian systems, optimal nonlinear filtering and effective algorithms for approximating  optimal nonlinear filters,  stochastic variational  methods and the stochastic maximum principle,  numerical methods for jump-diffusion type control and game<br />problems (the current methods of choice), efficient numerical methods for Markov chain models, methods for singularly perturbed stochastic systems, an extensive development of controlled stochastic networks  such as queueing/communications systems under conditions of heavy traffic, methods for the analysis and approximation  of  systems driven by wideband noise, large-deviation methods for control problems with small noise effects,  stochastic distributed and delay systems, and nearly optimal control and filtering for non-Markovian systems.

S'My primary research work is in philosophy of science, philosophy of physics, and metaphysics as informed by physics.<br /><br />I am currently engaged in two research programs. The first is an examination of some traditional metaphysical issues, using contemporary physics to give a scientific explanation for why it profits us to use our particular folk concepts (or their philosophical refinements). Causation is one of the many important concepts that has been resistant to successful analysis, and I believe that a few conspicuous physical facts can explain why causation has previously defied all attempts at reduction. In brief, this difficulty arises because causation is a conglomeration of several incompatible principles that operate at different levels of conceptualization (i.e. the microscopic level of fundamental physics and the macroscopic level of ordinary objects and events). Our folksy use of causal concepts simplifies reality by mixing up these levels of description. What I show, however, is that this simplification is, at a deep level, unjustifiable, so that the widespread failure of causation theories is no surprise. Nevertheless, the simplification of the world into "causes" and "effects" gives us a useful folk physics for use in many simple cases of physical interaction, so that it turns out to be pragmatically rational that we meld together the conflicting principles constituting causation. That is, even though nothing in fundamental reality corresponds to our naive conception of the cause-effect relation, the physics of our world typically rewards people who guide their action by using various principles associated with causation, principles like, "You can\'t affect the past." I am currently working to extend this project by using my deflationary account of causation to clarify the concept of a decision, especially the conflicting intuitions in the debate between evidential decision theory and causal decision theory.<br /><br />The second research project is a clarification of the concepts of time, space, and matter as they are used in classical and contemporary physics by way of geometry. This investigation grew out of an interest I\'ve had in explaining a special time-asymmetry seen in a rare set of particle decay processes, (specifically involving neutral kaons and B particles). Ever since this asymmetry was discovered back in 1964, philosophers have largely set it aside, not knowing what to say about it. My work is an attempt to figure out a way to think about its implications. My primary working hypothesis is that --just as relativity unified our concepts of space and time-- this asymmetry suggests that the next unification of physics ought to involve unifying charges or masses with spacetime. This means that, in some sense, the distinction between electrical phenomena and matter/anti-matter is entirely geometric. Although when stated this crudely, my hypothesis is not a totally new idea, I nevertheless have in mind a specific interpretation that has been broadly overlooked. In addition to the part of this research that is directed at clarifying physical concepts, this project engages some more general philosophical issues. For example, in one paper I show how both classical and relativistic physics can be embedded in a more general theory. This has implications for theoretical reduction because it gives a clean example of how one thorny problem of reduction, e.g. how to understand one theory as a limiting case of another, might be circumvented.'

S'I have been studying children who are part of the multi-site, NIH Maternal Lifestyle Study (MLS), a longitudinal study of 1000 children prenatally exposed to cocaine.  The MLS children are now preadolescents, and my current work focuses on the etiology of poor outcomes. One study examines predictors of obesity (MLS children exceed the national average for obesity). A second study determines pathways to antisocial behavior and early substance use. I am also studying children who are part of the multi-site NIH Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle (IDEAL) Study, a longitudinal study of 400 children prenatally exposed to methamphetamine during pregnancy. My current work in the IDEAL study utilizes acoustic analysis of infant cries to examine the effects of methamphetamine exposure on arousal and regulatory processes.  My secondary research area merges cognition with kinematic analysis of directed reaches in high risk children.  Kinematic analysis provides a high resolution description of reaching efficiency (e.g, number of movement units, acceleration). For infants with prenatal cocaine exposure, I use a reaching-in-the dark paradigm to test their memory for sounding, unseen objects.  For youth who were born premature, I use a two-choice task to test for motor perturbations based on decision rules.  <br /><br />Additionally, in my role of Director of Research, I am the scientific administrator for the MLS and IDEAL studies, which includes protocol development and implementation, oversight of site adherence to protocol, and oversight of the Neurobehavioral Data Center that conducts data reduction and analysis.'

S"Professor Laidlaw became interested in application-directed graphics research as an undergraduate in computer science at Brown; there is something he finds immediately gratifying about creating pictures, particularly when they are related to a real-world application. Science offers endless questions that may eventually be understood through visualization and computational modeling. After receiving his master's degree in computer science, also at Brown, he worked for three years in industry, where he was one of the developers of the visualization software system AVS. He then returned to academia to get a PhD in computer science at Caltech, where he subsequently spent two years as a postdoc in the biology division."

Once a vaccine is available, HIV vaccine delivery will face many challenges.  HIV testing may need to be done before an HIV vaccine is given, and ideally this will be quick and easy to do.  As an effective HIV vaccine may lead to the development of antibodies against HIV, novel HIV testing methods may also be necessary.  Dr. Lally has conducted specific research in rapid HIV testing among at risk populations, including those in drug treatment and those who are incarcerated.  She is continuing to explore the use of rapid HIV testing in different settings.  <br /><br />Dr. Lally is the Co-Principal Investigator for Protocol RV 180:  Nucleic Acid Assays for Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Anticipation of an HIV Vaccine.  This study is being sponsored by the US Military HIV Research Program and will serve to evaluate multiple various nucleic acid assays.  HIV nucleic acid tests theoretically afford the technological means to rule out or confirm true HIV infection in individuals where traditional serological methodology is no longer a reliable index of HIV infection, as is anticipated to be the case in HIV-vacinees. <br /><br />In June, 2006, a vaccine was licensed to prevent infection with four strains of Human Pappilomavirus (HPV).  HPV infection is required before the development of cervical cancer, and this vaccine may serve to markedly decrease the rate of abnormal PAP smears as well as cases of cervical cancer both in the United States and throughout the world, if the vaccine can be effectively delivered.  Dr. Lally is also researching effective methods for HPV vaccine delivery among young women.'

S'Inhibin was a reproductive hormone about which very little was known in 1990. I was involved in the development of the first specific immunoassays for inhibin and performed studies that helped to define its normal physiology in men and women. This work subsequently led me to study inhibin and related proteins, such as activin, in infertility, cancer and pregnancy. In that regard, I had an instrumental role in the development of two clinical applications of the inhibin immunoassay; prenatal screening for Down syndrome and assessment of ovarian reserve. These tests are now widely used throughout the world.<br /><br />I have ongoing research projects on inhibin and activin in preeclampsia, endometriosis, ovarian cancer, oocyte maturation and fetal development in collaboration with investigators in the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pathology at Women & Infants Hospital and elsewhere. I have been funded by the NIH to examine the role of activin in human fetal palate development, a project that resulted from the fusion of my interest and experience in the inhibin family with my later training in prenatal testing. Most recently I have obtained funding to explore the interaction of inhibin B and premenstrual symptoms.<br /><br />In addition to my basic research interests, I have served as the manager for the laboratory portion of largest multicenter NIH obstetrical grant. The objective of the FASTER trial was to compare first and second trimester prenatal screening in 38,000 women across the country with all serum measurements performed in our laboratory. I was responsible for hiring and training staff and daily supervision of data and patient reports. The results of this trial were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and will influence national prenatal screening practices. I am currently a co-investigator on a supplemental project to look at the association of thyroid hormone levels and obstetrical outcomes in these patients.'

Landow has carried out pioneering research in a wide variety of fields, including Ruskin's biography, the relation of 19th-century aesthetics, moral theory, and psychological theory, 19th-century Biblical interpretation (said to be the world's expert on biblical typology in the 19th century). This research required a great deal of detective work, chiefly in private collections and MS libraries, as well as research libraries in the U.K. Landow has also done pioneering work on 19th century periodicals.  His work on Pre-Raphelite painting involved searching for and discovering rare pamphlets, unpublished correspondence, and hard-to-locate paintings. <br /><br />In the 1970s Landow began to employ mainframe computing with primitive line editor word-formatting to teach editing to postgraduate students, and from this effort a joint book publication resulted &#151; <i>A Pre-Raphelite Friendship</i>. Landow increasingly began to work with aspects of computing, jointed Brown's IRIS in the design and use of Intermedia, a major pioneering hypermedia environment, and from this has come a half a dozen books, more than 100 invited internation lectures and workshops, and visiting professorships in computer science at Southhampton, Singapore, and Zimbabwe. <br /><br />Landow, who invented the notion of the stylistics and rhetoric of hypertext writing, has conducted usability studies, comparisons of multiple software environments, and application of this technology to education, fiction and poetry. Virtually all of Landow's early research required work outside the Brown University library collections and much work abroad; most of Landow's work in computing, like his websites, have not received assistance from Brown but have been funded outside the university."

S'Mechanisms in Site-Specific Recombination<br /><br />Site-specific recombination is involved in regulation of gene expression, differentiation, evolution, and the life cycle of several viral genomes. As a model system for the molecular mechanisms of this genetic transaction, we are studying the integration/excision reaction of bacteriophage lambda. Among the questions being explored are those pertaining to the directionality of recombination, the mechanisms by which DNA strands are cut, exchanged and resealed, the identification of DNA target sites in a sea of "incorrect" DNA sequences, and the regulation of recombination.<br /><br />Global Regulation of Cell Physiology<br /><br />In the regulation and/or monitoring of overall cell physiology, a small number of proteins can affect the expression of a large number of apparently unrelated genes, some being turned on and others being turned off by the same protein. Several of these global regulatory proteins induce sharp bends in DNA at their site of binding. Our recent work has led to consideration of how these global regulatory proteins work.<br /><br />Protein-DNA Interactions<br /><br />DNA replication, protein synthesis, nucleosome organization, and recombination all depend upon the assembly of protein-DNA complexes.

S'We are investigating the role that the ubiquitin proteolytic system plays in the dynamics of gene expression by studying the mating-type determination and switching system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This model eukaryote exists as one of three cell types: two haploid variants (a and alpha) that can mate with each other to form the third type, a non-mating a/alpha diploid. These distinct cellular phenotypes are determined by the allele present at the mating-type (MAT) locus, which encodes a group of master regulatory transcription factors. Remarkably, in many strains, the mating phenotype is unstable, and cells of one haploid mating-type can differentiate into the opposite cell type. The phenotypic changes associated with such a switch occur during a single division cycle, suggesting that the transcription factors controlling mating-type are short-lived. Indeed, direct assays of protein stability show that each of these factors is rapidly degraded, with the highly conserved ubiquitin-proteasome pathway directing their proteolysis.<br /><br />We have found that strains genetically impaired in the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of alpha2, one of the MAT-encoded transcription factors, exhibit profound defects in their ability to undergo an alpha-to-a phenotypic change. Notably, the genetic transposition process of replacing one MAT allele with the other appears normal, indicating that alpha2 turn-over per se plays a key role in this cellular differentiation event. Thus, ubiquitin-mediated degradation is used to erase a pre-existing network of regulatory transcription factors, so that a new system of regulators can effectively establish a different phenotypic state. Such a mechanism is likely to operate during a number of diverse developmental transitions, ranging from the establishment of neuronal identity in insects to the differentiation of lymphocytes in mammals.<br /><br />We are extending this work by characterizing the changes that occur when the repressed mating-type genes reactivate and switch to an expressed state. Our goal is to understand, at a mechanistic and molecular level, the functional dynamics of these gene expression programs. In doing so, we hope to provide insight into the role of the ubiquitin system in the phenotypic changes that occur during cell growth and development.'

S"My major area of research is the modification of brain injury by temperature.  I have been involved in animal investigations to delineate the neuroprotective effects of reductions of brain temperature (2-3&#176;C), the effects of modest brain cooling on brain metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow, and the thermal characteristics of regional brain during cooling.   The animal investigations that I have completed have provided important background work for the recently completed clinical trials of reduction in brain temperature as a neuroprotective strategy following perinatal asphyxia.  I have been extensively involved in one of the two largest trials of brain cooling conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network.  This trial has now been completed, the primary outcome has been published, and I am currently working on the analysis of important secondary outcomes. I have been using the data of this trial to investigate the potential deleterious effects of elevated temperatures in infants with hypoxia-ischemia and given routine care following birth. I am involved in determining the utility of the amplitude integrated EEG as a prognostic tool for neurodevelopment. The latter information will help determine if the amplitude integrated EEG is a good diagnostic tool for identification of potential candidates for future trials of neuroprotective interventions.<br /><br />&#9;I am presently the Principal Investigator for the Brown site of the NICHD Neonatal Research Network, and I coordinate all Network studies ongoing in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Women and Infants' Hospital. The Neonatal Network is a consortium of 16 academic centers that pool their patients for the conduct of clinical investigations.  Current studies include a randomized trial of different modes of ventilator support to reduce the extent of chronic lung disease among infants < 28 weeks gestation, a randomized trial of different oxygen saturation goal range to reduce the extent of retinopathy of prematurity among infants < 28 weeks gestation, new modalities to diagnose systemic candida infections, and pilot studies to gather preliminary data for a trial of the use of inositol to reduce the extent of retinopathy of prematurity among infants < 28 weeks gestation. I am on multiple working study groups within the Network to plan and implement future studies. In addition to the studies listed above, the Network maintains an important database of morbidity and mortality among very low birth weight infants (birth weight < 1500 grams) and is linked to neurodevelopmental outcome at 18-22 months of corrected age.  I have been involved in studies to use this database and examine short-term outcomes as a function of admission temperature to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with a normal cranial ultrasound, and the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants undergoing CPR at birth.<br /><br />&#9;My final area of research has been collaborative research with investigators at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the Thermotek Corporation to develop new cooling devices to facilitate brain cooling with less variability in body temperature. This work involves pilot studies in animals (being conducted in Dallas) and ultimately application to infants undergoing cooling."

S'My research focus has been the effects of insufficient oxygen (hypoxia) and blood flow (ischemia) on the brain of infants born at term or near term. If severe enough, hypoxia-ischemia can lead to serious brain injury and ultimately delayed development and cerebral palsy. Hypoxia-ischemia represents a condition in which brain development has been normal until the time of hypoxia-ischemia.  Effective treatments could minimize the extent of injury; my research has centered on brain cooling as a potential therapy for this condition.'

S"In recent years, Charles Larmore has published work primarily on three topics in the area of moral and political philosophy. The first has to do with the foundations of political liberalism, and particularly with the nature of the principles by which a liberal political order can hope to respect the equal worth of each individual citizen while remaining neutral with regard to their differing conceptions of the human good.  A second topic has to do with the nature of the self, and the focus has been on the nature of the relation we have inescapably to ourselves in virtue of which we are selves at all; Larmore has argued that this self-relation is not one of self-knowledge or self-awareness, as philosophers have often assumed, but instead an essentially practical relation of being committed to thinking and acting in accord with the presumed truth of what we believe and the presumed value of what we desire.  The third area of work has been the nature of moral judgment, and here the focus has been on what it is in virtue of which moral judgments may count as true or false; Larmore's approach has been to argue that moral judgments are essentially about reasons for action, and to explore the metaphysical consequences of the idea that there really are such things as reasons."

S'Coordinate gene regulation is a fundamental process essential to all cells from the germ line to the immune system. Our long-term goal is to define how genes are identified for coordinate regulation, the key initial step in their regulation.  Dosage compensation is one of the best model systems for studying this process because all of the genes on a single chromosome are specifically identified and co-regulated.  Drosophila, like mammals, increase the transcript levels of a large number of diversely-regulated genes along the length of the single male X-chromosome precisely two-fold relative to each female X-chromosome.  <br /><br />We are developing innovative approaches to understanding how dosage compensation in Drosophila is established, the critical first step in coordinate regulation.  In this way, we will address the following key overall question: How are global and gene-specific transcriptional regulatory signals integrated to precisely regulate genes?  By combining genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches, we are addressing the following fundamental questions: 1) How are the functions of non-coding RNAs and cis-acting sequences integrated?; 2) How do multiple chromatin marks act together during targeting of transcription complexes?; 3) How can local enrichment of a DNA sequence generate a sub-nuclear domain?'

S"Charles (Chip) Lawrence has been involved in computational biology research since the early-1980s. At a time when research in the field was focused on algorithmic approaches, he was a pioneer in developing novel statistical approaches to biological sequence analysis. In fact, he was one of the first to recognize that the inherent statistical nature of genomic processes and the immense data resulting from genomic sequencing projects could only be fully analyzed by using statistical algorithms. <br /><br />Of particular note are his contributions to the development of sequence alignment algorithms, specifically through the application of Bayesian statistical methods and the adaptation of a Gibbs sampling strategy to this problem. This accomplishment is clearly demonstrated by his seminal Science paper in 1993 which describes the first application of the statistical technique Gibbs sampling to the problem of multiple sequence alignment.  Also at the forefront is Chip's research with Ye Ding on Bayesian statistical approaches to RNA secondary structure prediction, yielding predictions on the full ensemble of probable structures that an RNA molecule may adopt. <br /><br />The past several years of statistical algorithm development by Chip and his collaborators have yielded several widely used programs:  the Gibbs Motif Sampler, the Bayes aligner, Sfold, BALSA, Gibbs Gaussian Clustering, and Bayesian Motif Clustering.<br /><br />Chip's research continues to be focused on the application of Bayesian algorithms that he and his collaborators have developed, leading to biological insights on transcription regulation and identification of regulatory motifs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences, comparative genomics, antisense oligonucleotide and siRNA design, the composition of nucleotide sequences and detailed analyses of several protein families. <br /><br />In addition to being at the forefront of research in computational biology, Chip has devoted time to education. He developed a tutorial on Bayesian statistics and Gibbs sampling which he presented at The International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology '97 and '98, as well as to several university audiences. Chip has mentored several young investigators, introducing to this interdisciplinary field not only scientists with backgrounds in statistics, but also scientists with backgrounds in computer science and biology.<br /><br />His primary research interests are: Identification of subtle sequence signals in non-coding DNA; RNA structure prediction and gene regulationl; Bayesian Bioinformatics algorithms and applications; Prokaryotic transcription regulatory networks; and Mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation."

S'I am currently engaged in four main programs of research.<br /><br />The <b>Generalized Medical Interaction Analysis System<b> is a method for coding and analyzing provider-patient communication. It is based on Speech Act Theory, an influential tradition in socio-linguistics based on work by John Searle and J.L. Austin. Speech acts are essentially the social acts embodied in utterances, such as questioning (in fact there are many different kinds of questions), instructing, representing reality, promising, and many others. We decompose transcripts of clinical encounters into individual speech acts, label the type of speech act, and separately label the subject matter ("topic") of the utterance. Topic codes were based on concepts used in previous work by others, but are much more detailed. Topic codes may be expanded in any particular area of interest depending on the focus of the study.<br /><br />We have also developed software, called Interview Analyzer, to facilitate coding. IA can also be used to implement any system for coding transcripts of interpersonal communication.<br /><br />The GMIAS has generated many kinds of insights into the performance of the patient and physician roles, interaction processes, and the allocation of time in medical visits. We have published studies on communication about antiretroviral adherence and about sexual risk behavior; and the relationship of visit length with indicators of patient-centered communication throughout the visit.<br /><br />With my colleague Mary Catherine Beach at Johns Hopkins University, I am co-investigator for <b>Improving ARV Adherence Through Enhancement of HIV Providers\' Counseling Skills,</b> (Grant #1R34MH089279-01A1). Our colleague Gary Rose from the Massachusetts Institute of Professional Psychology is training HIV care providers -- both physicians and nurse-practitioners -- in Motivational Interviewing skills, and we are evaluating the results of the intervention. We believe we can demonstrate that this is a promising and cost-effective way to improve people\'s adherence to medications and other disease management and self-care behaviors, while enhancing the provider-patient relationship and providers\' job experience.<br /><br />As of this writing, I am hopeful I will soon receive funding for <b>Explanatory models and decision heuristics in HIV care</a>. People\'s perception and understanding of their health condition generally differs from that of their physicians. This is in part a matter of perspective. It is said that physicians\' explanatory models are biological, abstract, and reductionist; while patients models are bio-psycho-social, specific, and holistic. This is really a fancy way of saying that people live with their bodies and minds, and their state of health is inseparable from the rest of their life world. Physician models are called diseases, patient models are called illnesses.<br /><br />But they also differ in concrete ways. Few people have a deep understanding of biological science, so they attach whatever pieces of information they come across, whether from their doctors or other sources, to the available frameworks. For example, many people with HIV think of drug resistance as a change in their bodies, in contrast to the physician\'s explanation that it is a change in the virus resulting from Darwinian evolution. This can motivate behavior which is contrary to what the physician recommends, in this particular case occasionally suspending medication taking, rather than strict adherence.<br /><br />We will first develop a taxonomy of people\'s explanatory models and how they interact with their decision heuristics about medication taking and other self-care practices, using semi-structured interview. We will then develop a structured assessment based on this information, to quickly identify issues about which patients could benefit from education, or a conversation with their provider.<br /><br />We hope to extend this kind of work to other conditions, such as pediatric hematopoetic stem cell transplant.<br /><br />Finally, with funding through a supplement to an R01 award to my colleague (and Department Chair) Ira B. Wilson (Grant #3R01MH083595-03S1), we are developing a method called the <b>Comprehensive Assessment of Clinical Encounters System</b>. As useful as the GMIAS has been, a major limitation of it and all similar systems is that it merely allows us to count events. It does not capture the dimension of time, the dynamic process of interaction. Efforts to use information about the sequence of events in interpersonal interaction have largely foundered on mathematical intractability.<br /><br />We are trying to solve this problem by imposing a layer of higher order structure on the speech act information: the specific problems or issues which arise in the visit, the various processes through which they are addressed, and the nature of the resolutions (if any) of the issues. Within this structure, we believe the sequence information will be much more analytically tractable and interpretable.'

S"Dr. Laws has studied the patient experience of illness and health care for 15 years. He has been particularly influenced by his studies under the late Irving Kenneth Zola, a pioneer in the sociology of chronic illness and disability. As evaluator of numerous federally funded behavioral health services for people with HIV, he developed a commitment to clinical research based in the patient's perspective. He has focused particularly on physician-patient communication, including the construction and measurement of patient agency in medical encounters.  He developed the Generalized Medical Interaction Analysis System, which has been the basis of several published studies.  The long-term goal of his research is to support the continuing transformation of medicine and health care more broadly into an institution built around patients' needs &#150; physical, psychological, and social; which meets those needs effectively; and in which patients have ultimate agency and authority."

Two settings are of special interest in considering oxidative stress for control of a pathogen's virulence.  One of these is in phagolysosomes in which pathogens may be subjected to an oxidative burst as part of the defensive properties of our phagocytes.  A second setting is in the oxidative disinfection of our water supplies through halogens, aeration and ozone and other active forms of oxygen.

S'Host immunity to pathogens is multifaceted, involving cell-to-cell interactions and communication among many different cells via cytokines. Dissection of such a complex network of immune responses requires extensive knowledge of the infection system and careful examination at optimal conditions. My previous and current research have focused on understanding the immune response mediated by the Natural Killer (NK) activating receptor Ly49H during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, leading to several seminal contributions, in which I demonstrated the identification of the Ly49h gene as a resistant gene, the generation of Ly49H-transgenic mice, the generation of Ly49H-deficient mice, and the identification of a novel pathway mediated by Ly49H during prolonged infection to regulate CD8 T cell responses. This work has served to establish one of the most powerful models for the study of the roles of an NK activating receptor in viral infections.

The book focuses on the circulation of children, or the many ways that young people are moved between households and families: from informal adoptions to household labor recruitment, and from child trafficking to legal adoption.<br /><br />The Circulation of Children has been reviewed in <a href="http://bit.ly/96QR79">Signs</a> (Florence Babb); <a href="http://bit.ly/cmHwwf">American Ethnologist</a> (Michael D.

Both internationally adopted children and international labor migrants cross borders, leaving their countries of origin and moving to new homes. Furthermore, the presence of migrant laborers in a host country, particularly if they are from the same region as adopted children, has an effect on the way that host nationals perceive adopted children, with significant consequences for the identity development of those children as they grow up in a multicultural nation. Amid the prevalence of both migration and adoption from other countries, this project examines how the presence of one kind of "migrant" affects the integration and existence of the other. <br /><br />At Brown, Dr. Leinaweaver is the Vartan Gregorian Assistant Professor of Anthropology. She is also a member of the <a href="http://bit.ly/92zwoP">Population Studies and Training Center</a> and of the <a href="http://www.watsoninstitute.org/clacs/">Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies</a>.

S"My research interests focus on: the anthropology of identity and the identity of anthropology. The former has been pursued in field research, especially in Africa (Nigeria, Cameroun, and Zimbabwe), in village and urban contexts. The latter has been largely a matter of personal participation and teaching within the context of the discipline of anthropology. In Nigeria I was concerned, and continue to be, with how ethnic identity among the Ijo developed in an isolated, relatively culturally homogeneous, self-sufficient society that became severely impinged upon by a multi-ethnic nation and global economic prerequisites of oil exports. In Cameroun the setting shifts to a plural community within a plural state, and the emphasis is on formulating and retaining an identity as a minority ethnic group. Zimbabwe offers still another variation on a theme: a state containing one dominant ethnic group, the Shona, but with numerous migrants from adjoining states. Here my interest is on how participation in voluntary associations and other non-governmental organizations contribute to the formation of a national identity. My interest in the identity of anthropology has focused on the delineation of crises in the discipline's history that reflect shifts in theoretical orientation, in addition to prompting them."

This includes children at risk because of biological factors and children at risk due to social factors. Risk is broadly defined and includes cognitive and academic deficits, antisocial behavior, psychopathology, and substance use onset. We have studied biological factors such as prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and prenatal exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs (cocaine, marihuana and methamphetamine). Social factors include poverty, home environment, and parenting factors. The study of the interplay between biological and social factors provides an understanding of the mechanisms that determine developmental outcome. We have used interdisciplinary longitudinal research designs starting in the fetal and infancy periods to study the unfolding of developmental processes in normal and at-risk children though adolescence. We use both standardized tests and have developed our own neurodevelopmental measures to see how children react under mild stress. We also use cross-cultural designs to study "naturalistic" experiments in environmental and parenting conditions. Translational research includes the study of treatment for behavioral disorders in infancy and early childhood and social policy research involving the judicial and child welfare systems.'

S'My current research focuses on finding new tools for improving the diagnosis and management of dehydration in children with diarrhea, specifically in the developing world. Dehydration from diarrhea kills nearly two million children each year, mostly in developing countries. As the severity of the disease can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains a crucial step in preventing mortality from this disease. Unfortunately, the diagnostic tools available to physicians and other providers to assess the degree of dehydration in children with diarrhea are limited. I am interested in developing new clinical scales, specifically for assessment of children in the developing world, which can be used to accurately assess the degree of dehydration. In addition, I am interested in looking at how other tools, such as ultrasound of the inferior vena cava (IVC), and pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform (POPW) analysis, can also be used to improve the diagnosis of dehydration in children. Eventually, these tools could improve the management of dehydration in children with diarrhea, leading to both more effective and more cost-effective care while reducing mortality from this disease.'

S"Professor Lewis's current book project is tentatively titled, <i>The Eclipse of Ethical Practices in the Modern West: On the Cultivation of Character in Everyday Life</i>. Much recent work in religious ethics has focused on a purported absence of ethical practices for the formation of good character in modern ethics. Against that narrative, this book will argue that practices of ethical formation have neither gone away nor ceased to be objects of concern: they have migrated to the margins in canonical modern thought. In the wake of the Reformation, these practices have largely become embedded in ordinary life. Accordingly, four sites have taken on particular significance: home, school, work, and church. My project seeks to uncover and argue for the significance of oft-neglected treatments of ethical formation from a decisive moment in Western thought. It thereby sheds new light on the shifting relation of religion and ethics in the last 250 years.<br /><br />He is also a co-founder, together with Nathaniel Berman (Cogut Center) and Nukhet Sandal (Watson Institute) of Brown's Religion and International Project."

S'Hepatitis B virus: The early events of HBV infection are poorly defined due to dynamic nature of the entry process and lack of a systemic approach to identify the cellular components required for individual steps. The host factors, once identified, may serve as critical targets for therapeutic intervention, thus reducing the rate of chronic hepatitis and ensuing liver cancer. Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), the related hepatotropic DNA virus, may serve as a model system for the identification of viral receptor/co-factors as well as for the evaluation of novel molecular targets for intervention of hepadnavirus infection. We have previously identified and cloned two DHBV pre-S envelope-interacting proteins: p170 (carboxypeptidase D, DCPD) and p120 (glycine decarboxylase). The DCPD has been established as a DHBV docking receptor but fails to confer DHBV susceptibility of cell lines, suggesting that other cellular co-factors are necessary to establish productive viral infection. The p120 is distributed only in DHBV-infectible tissues and essential for a post-binding step of the DHBV life cycle. Optimal p120 binding in vitro requires truncation of the pre-S domain, which contains a putative cleavage site for PC7, a proprotein convertase. Our long-term goal is to understand virus-host interactions in the viral entry pathway and identify cellular targets for therapeutic intervention. We are currently using molecular approaches to investigate the molecular basis whereby p120 mediates productive DHBV infection and to determine the contribution of proprotein convertases to DHBV infectivity. We will also evaluate p120 as well as DCPD as molecular targets for intervention of DHBV infection. These studies will contribute to the understanding of the early events of hepadnavirus infection and may lead to the development of novel antiviral strategies for prevention of HBV induced liver cancer.<br /><br />Hepatitis C virus: Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is closely associated with the development of HCC in the setting of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to HCC development are poorly defined. Gene transfection experiments and transgenic mouse models revealed the potential of individual viral proteins to modulate the cell signaling pathways that are implicated in proliferation/apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and immune defense. The HCV core protein has been proposed as one of the key viral components contributing to oxidative stress, steatosis, and carcinogenesis. We found that expression of HCV core protein increased cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle progression. Consistent with this, the full-length HCV replicon stimulated cell proliferation better than the subgenomic replicon, which lacks the core gene. The fact that culture supernatant from core gene transfected cells stimulated cell growth suggests the role of secreted factor(s) in mediating the growth signal. Microarray analysis revealed that most of the genes involved in cell growth or oncogenic signaling are up-regulated rather than down regulated. Of particular interest is the marked up regulation of both wnt-1 and its downstream target gene WISP2. In this regard, activation of wnt signaling has been observed in approximately one third of HCC, and both proteins are secreted growth factors. Further molecular characterization of wnt1/WISP2 signaling in association with the core induced cell proliferation in the context of HCV replication may probe into the molecular mechanisms by which HCV infection modulates growth signaling and eventually leads to the development of HCC.'

S'1) Project Title:  European American and Chinese Immigrant Children\'s Learning Beliefs and Related Socialization at Home<br />Project Period:  March, 06-October, 2011<br />Principal Investigator:  Jin Li, Ed.D. Jin_Li@Brown.edu, 401-863-9326<br />Funding Agencies:  The Foundation for Child Development ($163,570) and the Spencer Foundation ($670,186) with a total of $833,756<br /><br />The purpose of this 3-year longitudinal study (4th year for data analysis and report writing) is to document (1) what learning beliefs (BLs) European American (EA) and Chinese immigrant (CI) children develop and how children are socialized at home in this development, (2) how they come to hold their learning beliefs, (3) how CI children adapt to both home and mainstream socialization, and (4) how children\'s beliefs influence their actual learning and achievement. <br /><br />Children\'s capacity to learn develops early on, as do their BLs.  BLs concern children\'s ideas about why they need to learn, how they should learn, whether they like learning, and who can help them learn. However, traditional research focuses much more on children\'s ability, school readiness, and teaching while paying little attention to children\'s own beliefs. BLs must also be studied in order to improve children\'s learning. <br /><br />Children\'s BLs are not innate but develop as a result of their interactions with their social world. Because of caregivers\' cultural/ethnic backgrounds, this socialization process also differs from group to group. Research shows that EA and Chinese children develop very different BLs. For example, when asked to talk about learning, EA children focus much more on the mind such as thinking, exploration, creativity, and verbal communication. Chinese children emphasize social and moral self-improvement along with developing personal virtues such as diligence, persistence, and concentration. Children from both cultures start to express such beliefs as young as four years of age. The older they are, the stronger their beliefs become. <br /><br />Despite this research, we know little about how children come to hold different BLs during the crucial preschool years. Neither do we know how their caregivers socialize them at home. Moreover, virtually no research exists on CI family socialization in this area. Yet, CIs are the largest and fastest growing Asian American group. CI children are growing up in America, a culture that is vastly different from their parents\' culture. In their socialization process, CI parents are likely to face acculturative challenges, and their children are also likely to experience cultural clashes. Finally, most research on CIs focuses on well-educated and middle-class population; little research exists on low-income families. Available research indicates that low-income CI preschoolers are far less prepared for school than their middle-class peers. This study seeks to address these research gaps. Our intention is to identify factors that promote positive development as well as factors that hinder such development in these two cultural and SES groups of children.<br /><br />This study uses a longitudinal design. We follow three groups, middle-class EA, middle-class and low-income CI children (100/group with a total of 300) as well as their mothers for three consecutive years starting with children at age 4. We collect data with ten sets of instruments from the children themselves, their mothers, mother-child interactions, teachers, and children\'s school records. Empirical methods include children\'s achievement tests, story completion, parent interviews, mother-child conversations, mother-teaching-child, mother diary, mother survey, and teacher ratings of children\'s learning and social adjustment. We analyze our data with mixed methods. <br /><br />2) Project Title:  The Meanings of Learning, Achievement, and Motivation: A Study of Achievement Beliefs and Behaviors in Three Cultural Contexts<br />Project Period:  May, 03-April, 06<br />Principal Investigator:  Janine Bempechat, Ed.D., Wheelock College, Co-PIs: Jin Li, Ed.D. and Susan Holloway, University of California, Berkeley<br />Funding Agencies:  William T. Grant Foundation ($470,000)<br /><br />The purpose of this collaborative project was to understand how low-income high school students from European-, African-, Latino-, and Chinese-American backgrounds as well as their peers in England and Russia make meaning in their daily home and school life, how they interact and learn from their parents, teachers, and peers. We interviewed each of the 352 students three times. The first time they were interviewed about their daily home life including educational aspirations their parents convey to them, family-child communication, peer interactions outside school, and home monitoring for schoolwork. The second interview was on students\' perceptions of key concepts such as "good student," "poor student," "good teacher," "not so good teacher," "smartness/intelligence," and "hard work." The third interview consisted of focus group discussions with 3-5 students per group about students\' experiences at school. In addition, we used the experience sampling method (randomly signaling each student 7 times a day with a preprogrammed watch) to collect data on their daily activities in and outside school, their preference for activities, and their emotions. We also collected students\' achievement data from school. <br /><br />Currently, we focus our data analyses on variations within each ethnic group between high and low achieving students with mixed methods. We have analyzed a portion of the data and have three journal articles in press, one on Mexican American low versus high achieving students\' perceptions of high achievement (the Urban Review), one on Russian high school students\' family relationships and school learning (Journal of Adolescent Research), and one on Chinese American students\' family social networks that support their learning (New Directions in Child and Adolescent Development). As we analyze more data, we will publish more research results.  <br /><br />3) Project Title:  Beliefs About Learning Among Children and Parents in Taiwan and the United States<br />Project Period:  May, 03-April, 06<br />Principal Investigator:  Jin Li, Co-PI: Heidi Fung, Ph.D., Academia Sinica, Taiwan<br />Funding Agencies:  Chang Ching-Kuo Foundation ($51,000)<br /><br />This study focused on early elementary schoolchildren with three components: (1) children\'s learning-related self-concepts, (2) parental socialization of learning beliefs, and (3) parents\' emotional reactions to children\'s learning attitudes, behavior, and achievement. For (1), we collected children\'s stories about themselves at home vs. at school. For (2) we recorded mother-child conversations about good learning attitudes/behavior vs. less desirable attitudes/behavior. For (3) we assessed emotional reactions to children\'s learning attitudes and achievement by mothers and fathers and their respective socialization strategies. Currently we have completed some data analyses of all three components. We have found that children\'s self-concepts are constructed in the nexus of three key dimensions: domain (home life vs. school learning), self-construal orientation (autonomy vs. relatedness), and cultural values (e.g., emphasis on social competence vs. moral self-improvement in school). We have also found the two cultures\' mothers socialize their children differently. European American (EA) mothers focus on fostering their children\'s self-confidence and pride; Taiwanese mothers emphasize continuous self-improvement. Finally, EA parents\' affects are pride for their children\'s good learning attitudes/achievement, but sadness and anger at teachers for poor attitudes/achievement. Taiwanese parents\' affects are relief for good attitudes/achievement but shame/guilt at themselves and anger at their own children for poor attitudes/achievement. We are in the process of publishing these results.<br /><br />4) Project Title:  Teaching as a Natural Cognition: Chinese Mothers and their Young Children<br />Project Period:  December, 03-November, 05<br />Principal Investigator:  Sidney Strauss from Tel Aviv University, Co-PI: Jin Li<br />Funding Agencies:  The Spencer Foundation ($35,000)<br /><br />Our goal was to investigate how indigenous (less influenced by the West) children (ages 3-8) from rural China develop their natural cognitive ability of teaching and how their mothers engage in teaching their young children household skills. We were interested in children\'s emergent understanding of other children\'s minds and their mothers\' assumptions about their children\'s cognitive capacities. We taught each child a novel board game and asked the child to teach a peer. We then asked each child\'s mother to teach her child a household skill. Both sessions were videotaped. We have transcribed and translated all data. We have also developed our coding schemes and analyzed some data. Our findings show that Chinese rural children are similar to Israeli children with regard to the developing sequence of their teaching cognition. However, differences in the styles of teaching were observed in both the children and their mothers.<br /><br />4) Project Title:  Culture and Speaking<br />Project Period:  Ongoing<br />Principal Investigator:  Jin Li<br /><br />This project aims at understanding how culture may influence people\'s speaking. The West emphasizes verbal communication and self-expression, but East Asia values action more than speaking. We have collected words and phrases from adults that refer to speaking in English and Chinese. These terms are rated by participants for their degree of positivity and negativity. We also present people with different types of persons juxtaposing speaking and action. People from different cultural backgrounds indicate the degree to which they like each type of person. Finally, we present participants with scenarios that occur routinely in daily life. Some scenarios depict characters who are self-expressive whereas other scenarios show characters who are not. We use mixed methods to analyze our data.'

S'Liang is interested in laboratory experiments, theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and petrologic and geochemical applications of mass transfer in fluid systems. Here the fluid can be an aqueous solution, a molten silicate, a crystalline solid, or a combination of the three. His laboratory experiments focus on diffusion, crystal dissolution, melt-rock reaction, phase equilibrium, and trace element partitioning in natural and synthetic systems. Results from these laboratory studies have been used to constrain transport properties and mass transfer mechanisms. His theoretical studies focus mainly on the development of self-consistent models for mass transfer in molten and partially molten silicates. Together with numerical calculations. Liang also conduct theoretical analyses to better understand fundamental mass transfer processes in the laboratory and nature. Numerical calculations using laboratory-derived thermodynamic and kinetic parameters have played a crucial role in connecting mass transfer processes over a large range of length scales (e.g., from 1-10 mm of grain scale to 10s of meters of geological outcrop scale, to 10s of kilometers of tectonic scale).'

S"Philip Lieberman's central interest is the nature and evolution of the biological bases of human language and cognition. His studies, 30 years ago, of the limitations placed on the speech capabilities of living apes by their anatomy opened up a new field of study. His inferences concerning the speech capabilities of Neanderthals have led to recent studies that show that fully human speech capabilities are apparent in the fossil record only 50,000 years ago in the upper Palaeolithic <br /><br />Since the 1980s Lieberman has focused on the properties of the brain that make human speech, language, and cognition possible. His current work focuses on the deep subcortical structures of the brain that work together with the traditional cortical areas of the brain, Broca's and Wernicke's areas together with many other neural structures, to confer these human capabilities. He has proposed that brain mechanisms that were initially adapted for motor control were modified by Darwinian processes to make higher cognitive and linguistic ability possible. The studies that he and his colleagues are conducting to test these premises include tests of patients with Parkinson's Disease and climbers ascending Mount Everest whose brains are stressed by the lack of oxygen at extreme altitudes. <br /><br />Lieberman continues to study the aspects of speech that convey emotion and linguistic information. Students who are interested in human evolution and the nature of the brain are welcome to participate in these projects. The findings of these studies &#151; and those of many other linguistic, neurophysiologic, and genetic studies &#151; refute the linguistic theories of Noam Chomsky that have been popularized by Steven Pinker.In Lieberman's most recent book, <i>Toward an evolutionary biology of language</i>, he demonstrates the central role of speech in human language and that, contrary to Chomsky and Pinker, the brain bases of language, thinking, and motor control are intertwined. His other research involves the photographic documentation of traditional Tibetan culture in the Himalaya.<br /><br />Lieberman&#146;s current sponsored research involves a study funded by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute that is directed at perfecting a method whereby cognitive deficits resulting from damage to subcortical basal ganglia may be remotely monitored by means of acoustic analysis of speech. This involves studies of mountain climbers ascending Mount Everest and of Parkinson's Disease patients. The project is directed toward the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#146;s projected manned mission to Mars in 2020, but it will have many applications on earth, including the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and monitoring aircrews for cognitive dysfunction induced by lack of oxygen. <br /><br />Lieberman&#146;s other sponsored project is funded by the Getty Foundation for the creation of a DVD documenting the 15th-century Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings of Lo Manthang, a remote temple complex in Nepal, which he photographed for the Getty Foundation in 1993 and 1994. Lieberman also consults for many organizations on speech analysis and voice identification, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)."

S'I am currently interested in how transnational performance is produced, staged, documented and crafted in the past century. I spend some time thinking about it as a genre or a way of describing contemporary global artistic encounters involving "Asia". In this regard, the question of "What is transnational performance" comes to mind. My main focus, however, is on how and why transnational performance can illuminate the stakes of intercultural encounters, histories of migration, the effects of neoliberal capitalism, diasporic predicaments and colonial afterlives in the Asias. Much of my research reconfigures conventional readings of Asian theater and performance by uncovering queer histories or placing them in comparative frameworks, what i call "transcolonial borderzones", that articulate particular conditions of displacement/belonging and racialized identity/identifications in performance. This often necessitates new modes of analysis that stretch beyond the discrete geographies of nation-states outlined by area studies, absolutist binaries such as East/West, First World/Third World, and/or disciplinary fields. I engage many of these queries and formulations in my first book manuscript, Tropic Spells: Performing Queer Encounters in the Asias, which looks at the homoerotics of colonial encounters using the white man/native boy dyad as a primary critical navigator and trope of "Asian performance."<br /><br />My second book project looks at the neoliberal cultural politics of U.S satellite campuses in Asia and the Middle East, and how the arts are embroiled in that global enterprise. I am interested in the role that performance plays in that educative empire, and what kinds of alternative programs can be set in place to sustain progressive agendas. What is the role of intellectual work, humanistic practices for the common good, and the arts in the age of the global university?'

S"The long-term goal of the present research program is to enhance the utilization of evidence-based injury prevention strategies and to encourage medical practitioners to disseminate focused information regarding injury prevention in the Pediatric Emergency Department (ED). The proposed research plan: (1) examines the efficacy of a Brief Motivational Intervention to enhance automobile safety restraint-specific injury prevention behaviors in parents/caregivers of younger children; (2) examines the efficacy of focused, behavior-specific, injury prevention discharge instruction supplements (Enhanced Standard Care) in increasing safety restraint-specific injury prevention behaviors in parents/caregivers of younger children; and (3) examines the impact of assignment to participation in a car-seat distribution and education program on safety restraint practices in parents/caregivers of younger children. We will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of parent/caregivers of children being evaluated in the Children's Hospital Emergency Department. Eligible, consenting participants will be screened with an injury assessment tool for inappropriate use of motor vehicle child safety restraints. High risk participants will be randomized into three intervention groups: Standard Care (SC), Enhanced Standard Care (ESC) and Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI). All participants will then be contacted three months following enrollment and surveyed regarding child safety restraint practices, attitudes, and knowledge. The following main effects will be evaluated with relation to child safety restraint practice and attitude change: (1) Intervention (SC vs. ESC vs. BMI); and (2) Injury status of child (injured vs. non-injured). In addition, we will monitor re-injury rates of the index children of all enrolled parent/caregivers for one year from the time of enrollment and compare on the bases of the above main effects. This study examines the Pediatric Emergency Department as a location for increasing safe car seat practices by parents who are not restraining their children appropriately in motor vehicles. Three different interventions will be tested to determine their effectiveness in increasing safe car seat practices."

S"My work on the history of printmaking and book illustration also comprises research into the larger visual culture of early modern Italy and the role and creation of imagery in all media. <i>The Invention of the Italian Renaissance Printmaker</i> discusses the history of the technology and uses of printing in the formation of artist's careers in late 15th- and early 16th-century Italy, seeking to identify the roots of a common literacy in the skill of disegno, which was judged to be the intellectual and practical basis of all artistic practice. By investigating the currency of disegno in fields other than the fine arts, this project points out how modes of drawing that were developed in other trades and under different circumstances were brought to bear on the mythological, technical and religious imagery of Italian Renaissance prints in the first hundred years of printing by printmakers entering the new field from a variety of already established trades and professions. <br /><br />My current research focuses on the roles of book illustration and literacy in vernacular scientific and religious treatises printed in 16th- and 17th-century Italy, and particularly in Rome. In a series of articles and a forthcoming book, I explore the role of illustrations in creating authorial credit and claims for particular kinds of knowledge among a newly created community of authors and their patrons. New notions of intellectual property and self-consciousness about the status of authorship, the development of printing, imaging and publishing conventions for the attribution of authorship in an age of censorship, the stated and covert relationships between objectivity and observation, the representation of truth claims in pictures and text, the effect of gender differences in the creation of an authorial voice and the rise of professionalism in the arts in the early modern period (1400-1800) are all part of this project. Working through case studies centered on particular books or modes of publication, I look at opportunities offered by the new conventions of publication to otherwise voiceless minorities (e.g., women, artisans or Jews) as well as to established religious groups motivated to re-emphasize their orthodoxy after the Council of Trent."

S"Lindstrom's research examines the determinants and consequences of internal and international migration in economically developing societies, and the changing dynamics of reproductive behavior and health. Much of his research examines how context influences individual and couple decisions about the occurrence and timing of marriage, childbirth, and migration. <br /><br />With support from NSF, and small grants from RAND, the Hewlett Foundation, and NICHD, a major area of my recent work is migration and demographic change in Guatemala. This research uses individual and aggregate-level census data, and original and existing survey data to examine the social dynamics of internal and international migration, the impact of residential change on fertility practices, and the diffusion of contraceptive knowledge and urban fertility behavior into rural migrant sending areas. Guatemala is a predominantly rural and ethnically segregated country where the indigenous Mayan population scores below the mixed race ladino population on standard economic and demographic indicators of well-being. On the surface internal migration streams are consistent with ethnic avoidance and fundamental ethnic differences in the attraction of economically developed places. A multi-level analysis of individual out-migration and choice of destination, however, provides no evidence of ethnic avoidance nor substantively important differences in how Maya and ladinos evaluate economic opportunities in places of origin and destination. The presence of co-ethnic migrants from one's own community of origin has the largest influence on choice of destination, and not the ethnic composition of the destination per se. Potential migrants, regardless of their ethnicity, rely on their networks for information and assistance with migration. The ethnic exclusivity of localized social networks generates distinct ethnic patterns of migration, even though decisions about choice of destination are insensitive to the ethnic composition of the destination. Other research using time series data reveals that Mayan out-migration during the insurgency of the 1970s and 1980s was more sensitive to the level of political violence at the local level than was the case for ladinos. Research using survey data that Lindstrom collected in Guatemala indicates that when presented with the opportunity to migrate to the United States, Maya men abandon distinctly Maya seasonal labor migration practices, and adopt international migration behavior similar to ladinos.  Collectively, these results suggest that fundamental ethnic differences in migration behavior are due more to differences in the structure of opportunities and constraints found locally, than ethnic differences in the way people evaluate opportunities.<br /><br />In a related line of my research in Guatemala I examine the intersection between migration and reproductive behavior and health. Modern contraceptive knowledge and use, and fertility levels in rural areas of Guatemala are comparable to levels in sub-Saharan Africa, especially among the indigenous population.  In several papers I document rural-urban migrant adoption of urban fertility and contraceptive behavior, consistent with what has been found in other developing countries. However, I take this research further than other studies on migration and fertility and examine the impact of urban and international migration on the fertility of non-migrants in rural communities of origin. I find strong evidence of the diffusion of contraceptive knowledge and urban reproductive behavior back to rural migrant sending areas. Return migrants and migrant friends and relatives in urban and international destinations not only send back remittances and information about employment opportunities in destination areas, they also provide information, advice, and examples of urban reproductive practices. Using retrospective life history data from the Mexican Migration Project I examine the inter-relationship between the timing of migration and the timing of births; the role of human capital, social capital, and capital assets on husbands and wives migration; and the consequences of return migration from the U.S. to Mexico and cumulative U.S. migration experience on occupational mobility in Mexico.<br /><br />A third area of research is focus on reproductive health and adolescent transitions to adulthood in Ethiopia. Beginning in 2001, with the support of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Dennis Hogan and I launched a new program of capacity building and translational research in the areas of reproductive health and population studies with the participation of Addis Ababa, Gonder, and Jimma Universities. The focus of this program is faculty training in the collection and analysis of reproductive health data and the translation of research results into policy relevant recommendations. From 2001-2004 researchers from Brown University conducted a series of seven, three-day workshops on the methods and materials of demographic analysis. Background Reports presenting summary findings from recent population surveys were produced for national dissemination and for publication in national and international scientific journals. In 2005, our efforts shifted to research and capacity building at Jimma University, and the Jimma Longitudinal Family Survey of Youth (JLFSY) was started. The survey is designed to assess adolescent health status and health needs, and to identify the determinants of alternative pathways to adulthood, including supportive features of families and communities and risk factors associated with poor health and social outcomes. The survey follows approximately 3,700 households and 2,100 youth for a period of five years. <br /><br />I currently direct this project along with Assistant Professor of Anthropology Craig Hadley (Emory University) and Professor of Public Health, Tefera Belachew (Jimma University). To-date two rounds of household interviews and three rounds of adolescent interviews have been completed. Results from the survey have been disseminated in the form of two-page Policy Briefs that are targeted at local health service providers, and research articles published in scientific journals and presented at scholarly conferences. At list of publications and Policy Briefs is on the Ethipia Project website, which can be accessed through the webpage of the Population Studies and Training Center (PSTC), Brown University."

S"Stroke rehabilitation Clinical Trials Phase II/III in Robotic Neurorehabilitation<br />[Upper extremity with MIT-Manus system] <br /><br />Robotic-assisted rehabilitation is a promising intervention for reversing upper extremity impairment in chronic stroke. Stroke is the leading cause of disability for older Americans. Much of this disability can be traced to the lasting neurological impairments in stroke survivors, particularly when the functional deficits affect the arm and hand. Currently there are no definite rehabilitative therapies for chronic stroke patients. Accordingly, there is a strong clinical impetus to develop interventions to restore neurological function, including during the chronic period of stroke recovery.  Innovations in clinical robotic technology in conjunction with advances in the understanding of the potential for neurological recovery in the chronic stages of stroke now make it possible to test a promising new therapy using task-specific, robot-assisted neurorehabilitation for the upper-limb in chronic stroke patients. Preliminary studies have examined over 250 stroke patients using earlier version of the MIT-manus robot. <br /><br />I am the principal investigator for a $4.8 mil phase II/III multi-centered clinical trial funded by the Veteran's Administration (Clinical Science Program and Rehabilitation Research and Development Services) to test the most advanced MIT-manus system (modules which include training of the shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand) in chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe upper-limb impairment. The trial was initiated in November of 2006. The 4 sites include VA Medical Centers in Baltimore MD, Gainesville FL, and Seattle WA, and West Haven CT. The study plans to enroll approximately 160 subjects over 3 years. As of July 2008, over a 100 stroke subjects have participated. This randomized-controlled trial for stroke rehabilitation using robotics has received various regional and national media coverage.<br /><br />Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Pilot Studies Robotic Neurorehabilitation<br />[Lower extremity with Lokomat]<br /><br />Ongoing walking impairment is a clinical problem and important source of disability for people with MS.  MS patients even at the earliest stages of disease have observable gait problems, and over the lifetime of the disease, the majority of MS patients will progressively decline in their gait function. Robot-assisted rehabilitative devices are a promising technology for improving impairment in the lower extremity. We have completed studies on over 20 patients with MS using the Lokomat (a robot drive lower extremity orthotic) or the Ankle-bot (a device developed at MIT by Hermano Igo Krebs that assists with ankle flexion-extension and supination-pronation). These studies have systematically characterized gait abnormalities, as well as changes in strength, quality of life, fatigue and disability in MS following robot-assisted interventions. <br /><br /><br />Neuroprotection in Multiple Sclerosis and animal models<br /><br />It is becoming increasingly clear that Multiple Sclerosis pathology involves significant neurodegeneration, and it is the neurodegeneration that most contributes to the ongoing disability in MS. We have conducted a number of preclinical studies for neuroprotection using experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, while at Yale University in the Laboratory of Dr. Stephen Waxman.  In this model we have developed a well-calibrated and reproducible model of axon loss with the optic nerve and spinal cord tracts. We have been able to show robust axonal neuroprotection in EAE animals using sodium channel blocking agents. In addition there was improvement of spinal cord electrophysiological conduction and clinical paralysis compared to untreated EAE. The majority of the current FDA-approved agents for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis act on immunomodulatory pathways. We have ongoing interest in conducting a clinical trial for neuroprotection in MS.<br /><br />Investigations in Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Epidemiology<br /><br />Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous chronic disease, which neither the course of the disease or a patient's response to therapy is predictable. As a result treatment patterns for MS can vary considerably. A systematic assessment aimed at understanding the current state of MS healthcare is critical to determining treatment patterns, including gaps in care and can potentially provide useful information to improve the regional and national healthcare delivery for people with MS. One approach that I have been pursing is to assess MS care using the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Database to examine the delivery and pattern of MS healthcare. The NARCOMS patient registry is the largest and most comprehensive registry of MS patients in the world with over 24,000 active participants, and we have initiated a series of studies to further investigate the current state of MS epidemiology using this database, with a particular emphasis on veteran care.<br /><br />in development<br /><br />Rhode Island Multiple Sclerosis Study (RIMMS)<br /><br />As an initial study of the Brown University Genebank initiative and in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Buka (Professor of Epidemiology), we have initiated a prospective, community-based longitudinal study of Multiple sclerosis in the state of Rhode Island.<br /><br />Much of the understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) epidemiology and clinical course has been derived from cohort studies collected outside the United States or from short-term pharmaceutical clinical trials. These sources of information may have inherent biases that limit their usefulness to typical patients in the community. A population-based study in the US that aims to combine rich epidemiologic and clinical data is critical to advancing both scientific understanding and providing accurate information to guide treatment. The RIMSS study proposes to establish a prospective population-based cohort study of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Rhode Island. Overall goals include enumerate and provide accurate data on incident and prevalent cases of MS and clinically isolated syndrome and collect demographic and diagnostic data from medical records. <br />Evolving phases of the study will include baseline assessments on a random stratified sample of approximately 400 new incident and prevalent cases of MS and CIS to approximate the longitudinal course of these conditions using a balanced and informative cross-sectional design. In doing so, we will be able to describe the prevalence of physical disability, cognitive disability, symptomatic areas, and magnetic imaging changes by disease subtypes (relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS, primary progressive MS, CIS) and duration of disease, and treatment with disease modifying agents. Finally, we will initiate the longitudinal assessments of the 400 subjects with comprehensive baseline assessments. This phase will also enroll and follow the unaffected siblings to examine the development of MS or other autoimmune disorders.  The scope of multidisciplinary study provides an opportunity to build a unique national MS cohort based in Rhode Island to clearly capture critical information in order to better understand the clinical and epidemiological sciences MS.<br /><br />Mild traumatic brain injury: impact on attention, cognition and motor control<br />Investigators: Stephen Correia, Leigh Hochberg, Albert Lo, Stephen Mernoff, Michael Worden.<br /><br />There is currently no brief, reliable, valid, and easily administered test to gauge attention and executive cognitive capabilities following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).<br />mTBI occurs frequently in sports and in combat environments and is associated with declines in attention, mental processing speed, reaction time, and executive functions, that are important in sports and crucial in combat situations where detection and reaction to threatening vs. non-threatening targets is vital. To date, no objective measure has been widely adopted to predict safe and efficacious resumption of play or combat duty.  The current gold standard for assessing cognitive functioning following mTBI is neuropsychological testing, which can take up to three hours to administer and have uncertain validity for predicting successful return action. We plan to develop a brief, reliable, valid, and easily administered computerized assessment of attention, cognition and motor reaction."

Of particular interest is the examination of cultural factors that affect sibling adjustment, sibling participation in a child\'s care, and pediatric health disparities. Ongoing projects are examining the psychological adjustment of Latino siblings of children with developmental disabilities and factors affecting sibling involvement in the management of childhood disorders such as asthma, diabetes, and Crohn\'s disease. Finally, innovative interventions for siblings are developed and evaluated through "SibLink", a clinical program at Rhode Island/Hasbro Children\'s Hospital dedicated to brothers and sisters of children with medical, developmental, and behavioral needs.<br /><br />In addition to research on family functioning, Lobato is also involved in clinical service and research related to feeding disorders and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). She is a principal investigator (along with Neal LeLeiko, MD, PhD/Director of Pediatric Gastroenterology) on an NIH grant to establish a collaborative multisite study of biomedical and behavioral factors that influence outcomes in pediatric IBD. The project is based on the belief that a constellation of psychological (e.g., depression) and behavioral (e.g. medication nonadherence) factors may lead to negative disease outcomes and intrusive medical procedures among children and adolescents with IBD.'

S'Following are the descriptions of several new and continuing research projects that illustrate Dr. Logan\'s activities:<br /><br />1.  Katrina and the Built Environment: Spatial and Social Impacts <br /><br />This project studies the social vulnerability of coastal communities by focusing on places, including urban neighborhoods and rural counties, identifying whose communities were most affected, which will be rebuilt and how they will be different from before, and which segments of the population will be permanently displaced.  Its premise is that the impacts of environmental disasters depend not only on their location, return interval, and intensity, but also on the spatial distribution and mobility of distinct population groups.  Further, the course of post-disaster adjustment &#150; taking into account new configurations of what are considered safe or desirable areas, choices about public infrastructure investments, locational decisions made by past and potential new residents &#150; reveals the social, economic, and political processes that create and recreate the built environment.  We approach this from the perspective that disasters, at least in the distribution of their consequences, are man-made (Mileti 1999, Moore et al 2004). <br /><br />The project will study the impacts of Hurricane Katrina, along with the recovery and reconstruction process as it unfolds.  It will integrate remotely sensed ecological data with environmental hazard information, as well as demographic and socioeconomic data, to understand the social and ecological vulnerabilities of impacted communities.  The opportunity for this research is time-dependent.  For example, much privately-held remotely-sensed data is temporarily in the public domain, and it is important to work with it immediately.  Information on the decision making process for rebuilding needs to be gathered by interviews and document collection as proposals appear and are acted upon in the next year.  Validation of physical and ecological impacts needs to be done prior to their removal/alteration.<br /><br />Intellectual merit: This project is unique in that it takes an eco-social approach to understanding the underlying drivers of population vulnerability to natural disasters.  Indeed, although there has been much research on the ecological problems plaguing communities in the Gulf region and a large body of literature on the socioeconomic problems facing these diverse communities, there has been no attempt to integrate these two fields to make explicit the connections between environment and populations.  The magnitude of the social and ecological calamity highlights the need for such an integrated eco-social approach.  Consistent with the multidisciplinary emphasis of the Human and Social Dynamics program and the requirements of this approach, the core research team includes two sociologists (Logan and Brown), an environmental health scientist and epidemiologist (Morello-Frosch), a remote sensor (Mustard) and an ecosystem ecologist (Hamburg).  <br /><br />Broader impact:  Katrina is the natural event with the most far-reaching impacts on the U.S. population in this generation.  A scientific understanding of its effects will be valuable for public policymaking, both in the short term (investments in the region over the next several years) and in the long term (planning for the security of coastal zones).  The project will also provide information that can be of use to future studies, including surveys of returning and relocated residents and risk assessments of other areas.<br /><br /><br />2.  Immigrant Pathways to Political Incorporation<br /><br />This project will address the question of why the political influence of immigrant groups in the U.S. remains considerably lower than that of non-Hispanic whites and African Americans.  Specifically, it will study the processes of attainment of citizenship, voter registration, and voter turnout in the period 1996-2000.  The first key question is this: What is the impact of nativity itself on the behaviors of immigrants, relative to and controlling for the effects of other factors that may influence them, including personal characteristics that also affect political participation among non-immigrants?  The second key question is: How are individual behaviors affected by the ethnic and residential communities in which people are members?  Political behavior is inherently collective, and decisions about whether or how quickly to gain citizenship, to register, and to vote are partly responsive to the political culture and political movements that swirl around them.  This project therefore will focus on both individual and collective factors.<br /><br />3.  Immigration, Ethnicity and the Family: 1900-1920<br /><br />This study examines patterns of intermarriage and of co-residence of parents and children in Chicago between 1900 and 1920.  Intermarriage (across racial or ethnic lines) is the family behavior most closely charted by sociologists interested in ethnic assimilation.  Living arrangements are an important indicator of family relationships, often thought to represent patterns of status and authority within the family or people\'s ability to rely on family support at various points in their lives.  Like the decision to marry within one\'s group, the choice by parents and grown children to live together has sometimes been viewed by social scientists as an ethnic behavior.  Hence both intermarriage and co-residence are relevant to processes of adaptation of ethnic and racial minorities to a new urban environment, one of the central phenomena of American cities at the turn of the century.  <br /><br />The study will explore the applicability of assimilation theory, which emphasizes the progressive cultural adaptation and incorporation of new groups into mainstream society over time, to family relations in this period.  This issue is important in its own right.  Results from this period are also relevant to the present time, providing a baseline against which contemporary processes of assimilation and family change can be compared.  <br />Two kinds of analyses will be conducted.  The first will use cross-sectional data from 1920, 1910, and 1900.  Models of intermarriage will be estimated for all adults (with the category of "not married" treated as a distinct category).  Models of household composition will be estimated for two partially overlapping sets of people: for ever-married persons aged 40 and over who may have grown children, and for persons aged 50 and under who may have living parents.  As a test of assimilation theory, central questions are whether intermarriage and living arrangement are predicted by indicators of acculturation to American or Northern society (such as number of generations in the city and &#150; for immigrants &#150; age at immigration, years since immigration, language ability, and naturalization).  The analysis will also incorporate information on people\'s ties to ethnic communities: residence in an ethnic neighborhood and work in an ethnic occupational niche or enclave economy.  These variables will offer special insight into the impact of ethnic attachments on the family.<br /><br />This study breaks new ground in its plan to analyze information on marriage and living arrangements over time with historical census data.  Large samples of men and women aged 21 and above will be selected from the 1920 sample and traced back to the 1910 and 1900 census manuscripts, using standard genealogical methods.  Although such tracing has been done before, this is the first study involving both men and women.  Use of longitudinal data resolves critical methodological problems in the study of intermarriage.  Panel data enable analysis of the effects of personal characteristics as measured prior to marriage on the odds of marriage and intermarriage by 1920, plus analysis of predictors of marital disruption and other outcomes by 1920 &#150; including the potential effect of intermarriage itself.  In cross-sectional studies, by contrast, a criticism of the use of census data is that any sample of current marriages may be biased by differential survival of in-married and intermarried cases.  This is also the first historical panel study of change &#150; rather than only cross-sectional variations &#150; in living arrangements (investigating which young persons living with parents in 1900 had left the nest by 1920, and which parents and grown children living apart in 1900 were co-residing by 1920).  This unique panel data file will be made available to other researchers for work on the family or the many other topics for which these data are appropriate.<br /><br /><br />4. Group Boundaries in New York and Chicago, 1900-1920<br /><br />This project studies the residential and labor force positions of ethnic and racial groups in this country\'s two largest cities, New York and Chicago, at the turn of the century.  This was the high point of European immigration into both cities, and it also included the first wave of large-scale migration of Southern blacks to the North.  Discussions of this historical period, like those of the current time, attempt to assess the degree to which these groups experienced a process of assimilation into the mainstream or, alternatively, created or were confronted by enduring group boundaries.  The principal questions involve the degree to which blacks and/or the main immigrant groups &#150; Germans, Irish, Italians, Russians, and Poles &#150; were segregated into specific neighborhoods and occupational niches, and the extent of their mobility over the life cycle and across generations.<br /><br />To examine residential patterns, previously untapped data on the racial and ethnic composition of census tracts of both cities in 1920 will be used.  Newly released census data files for individuals (the 1920 IPUMS files), which include people\'s address and census enumeration district, will be linked to these tract data, making possible the estimation of individual-level models of residential attainment.  <br /><br />To examine labor force patterns, the IPUMS files will be analyzed in terms of occupational clustering and segregation, levels of occupational standing, and the existence of ethnic economies based on concentrated group ownership and employment in certain sectors.  <br /><br />A unique feature of the study is the tracing of a random sample of 4,000 of the 1920 residents of each city to 1900 census records.  This will allow evaluation of assimilation and group boundaries to be based on analyses of occupational and residential mobility over time for a representative sample of the population including both men and women.'

S'Dr. Longabaugh, a social and clinical psychologist, is a professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the Brown Medical School, which he joined at its inception in 1972. Dr. Longabaugh became the associate director of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies (CAAS) in 1986 in order to develop the Center\'s research mission. During this period he directed numerous studies of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of alcohol treatment, funded primarily by the NIAAA, as well as assisting other CAAS colleagues in the development of their research ideas. He also provided the leadership for the Center\'s postdoctoral training program in alcohol treatment/intervention research from its inception in 1986 until 2000 and was awarded a Sharon Chauncey Fellowship Award by CAAS for his leadership of the program when he resigned his position. Over 50 fellows graduated from the program during this period. Many have now achieved leadership positions in the field. <br /><br />A recognized leader in alcohol treatment research, Dr. Longabaugh has served regularly on NIAAA advisory committees; notably, he was the first chair for the scientific advisory group (IRG) on alcohol treatment and clinical research. Dr. Longabaugh, a fellow of the American Psychological Association, has published over 249 research articles and books and in 1999 received the Dan Anderson Research Award from the Hazelden Foundation for his research contribution to the recovery process. <br /><br />Since 2000, Dr. Longabaugh has reduced his research effort to half time. He continues as co-investigator on four ongoing studies and is collaborating with and assisting more junior colleagues at Brown and elsewhere in the preparation of new grant applications related to his research program on mechanisms of change in behavioral treatments. He continues to serve on advisory panels and review committees for NIAAA. Most recently he participated in NIAAA\'s Consultant Group Meeting on a "Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiative".

S'Over the past three years I have worked on five topics: (Papers numbered in brackets identify my publications relevant to that topic.  See the list at the end of this description.)<br /><br />a) Affirmative action [1, 2, 5, 7, 15, 17]: Several theoretical papers explore the efficiency, incentive and reputation effects of preferential selection policies.  We distinguish race-neutral from race-conscious affirmative action; and, we contrast preferential selection with preferential access to developmental resources.  An applied paper estimates efficiency consequences of imposing a "color-blindness" constraint on affirmative admissions policies at selective universities.  This work inspired a legal brief that was considered by the Supreme Court in the 2003 University of Michigan litigation. I have a contract with Princeton University Press to write a small book tentatively entitled, <i>What Price Diversity?  The Economics and the Ethics of Affirmative Action Policies.</i>  A draft should be ready by fall 2006.<br /><br />b) Identity [8, 9]: Two papers explore a mathematical model aimed at capturing in a rigorous way some of the connections between identity, culture and social performance.  A novel definition of identity is proposed; the sense in which a group\'s collective identity can be dysfunctional is made precise; and, mechanisms of social interaction are described through which rational actors nevertheless may come to define themselves in a way that inhibits their economic functioning.<br /><br />c) Racial stigma [4, 6, 14, 16, 18]: In chap. 3 of my 2002 book, <i>The Anatomy of Racial Inequality</i>, and in several subsequent essays, I develop a theory of "racial stigma" &#150; in contrast to the classical notion of "racial discrimination."  My main idea is to distinguish the formal economic transactions of markets from the informal social interactions of neighborhoods, families, and friendship networks.  Citing a broad array of evidence, I argue that racial inequality in contemporary American society derives more from disparate treatment in the latter than the former domains, and I speculate on the implications of this conclusion.<br /><br />d) Racial justice [3, 11, 13, 18]: In chap. 4 of my 2002 book, and in subsequent essays, I develop a principled approach to questions of racial justice in the U.S. context.  Through this work in social philosophy, I formulate the axiom that any concept of intergenerational justice must be "closed to moral deviation." I contribute to the debate over slavery reparations for American blacks by applying this axiom to the dynamic social choice problem which this debate implicitly poses.<br /><br />e) Wage inequality [12]: A theoretical paper models how the distribution of ability gets mapped onto a distribution of earnings in a hierarchical job assignment model. How better information about individual workers\' abilities affects the level and distribution of earnings is explored.<br /><br />Finally, I am currently starting work on a new book entitled, <i>Social Analytics: Race, Inequality and the Promise of Economic Theory.</i> This would be a book on the practice of social science and social criticism, drawing on my own past writings.  The central premise of the book is that my style of "public intellectual" work is noteworthy in the extent to which it connects social scientific insights with writing on popular themes.  With this book, I hope to present a model for how technically adept social scientists can engage in the larger, national conversation on issues of policy significance. The concluding chapter will be an essay describing my political journey as an economist and public intellectual, from my early career as a traditional liberal, to my national prominence as a "black conservative" intellectual during the Reagan era, to my current position as a left-of-center critic of conservatism.  The narrative will relate this political odyssey to the intellectual positions illustrated by the technical and discursive essays collected in this volume.<br /><br />Publications List:<br />1.

S'Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a member of TGF-beta superfamily, is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates numerous cellular functions. Abnormality of TGF-beta1 signaling has been implicated in several lung diseases, such as lung edema, emphysema, and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Using cultured lung macro- and micro-vascular endothelial cells, Dr. Lu will elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which TGF-beta1 regulates lung endothelial monolayer permeability, endothelial cell proliferation, and endothelial cell apoptosis. Using animal models of PAH induced by hypoxia and hypoxia plus SU5416, Dr. Lu will investigate the role of TGF-beta1 siganling in the development of PAH. Recently, Dr. Lu has started a new project investigating the role of TGF-beta1 signaling in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema, using cigarette smoked animal models. The overall objective of her research is to understand the role of TGF-beta1 in the pathogenesis of these severe lung diseases and hopefully to obtain novel approaches for treatment and prevention these lung diseases.'

More recently, this research experience has been translated into a clinical application, with the creation of the Fetal Treatment Program at Brown (<a href="http://www.fetal-program.org">www.fetal-program.org</a>).<br /><br />The Fetal Treatment Program offers the possibility of fetal surgical intervention for selected conditions, particularly severe Twin-to-twin Transfusion Syndrome. This surgical procedure is available in only a few centers nation-wide, and Brown is the only such center in New England. In 2004, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a multicenter, randomized trial (www.eurofoetus.org), which included Brown, showing a significant survival advantages for fetuses undergoing this procedure.<br /><br />We are pursuing clinical research in that field, as well as in other aspects of fetal medicine and surgery. Most recently, we obtained an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA - one of only two such studies approved in the U.S. - to treat severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia by endoscopic fetal surgery. <br /><br />Ongoing and future research projects include a laboratory model of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, the search for prognostic indicators in TTTS and the application of newer monitoring technology in endoscopic fetal surgery (the latter in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.engin.brown.edu/about/partnerships.html">Division of Engineering</a>)'

S"Dr. Magill is a clinical social worker who has focused her career on substance use treatment at the level of science and practice.  These experiences to date have led to a belief that research on change mechanisms can enhance knowledge gained from clinical trials research, and in the case of treatment outcome equivalence or difference. Such information can lead to greater treatment efficiency by identifying common treatment factors, treatment-specific ingredients, and thus, dissemination priorities.  Dr. Magill is currently a collaborator on three ongoing projects focused on process mechanisms of Motivational Interviewing with adult and young adult alcohol use and related consequences. This work is complemented by participation on a secondary analysis project targeting mechanisms of Alcoholics Anonymous, as well as dissertation research on outcomes and moderators of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, to provide a general foundation for studying the processes of psychosocial treatments for alcohol use disorders. The goals of Dr. Magill's recently awarded NIAAA K23 award are to provide advanced training in: (1) the development of measurement approaches for change process research and (2) the longitudinal analysis of change process mechanisms. This training will occur under the mentorship of Dr. Robert Stout, with co-mentorship provided by Dr. Richard Longabaugh and Dr. Timothy Apodaca and consultation provided by Dr. Kathleen Carroll and Dr. Carlo DiClemente. The subsequent research will employ observational coding methods on longitudinal Project MATCH session data to inform knowledge of within-treatment mechanisms in aftercare for alcohol use disorders.  The research focus is common factor mechanisms of client proximal and distal behavior change in treatment for alcohol use disorders."

Dr. Magill's research focus and desire to study change was inspired by clinical work with individuals with substance and other co-occurring mental health disorders. Dr. Magill entered the Brown University Postdoctoral Training Program in Alcohol and Addiction Studies in 2007.  As a postdoctoral fellow, she continued her training in the use of observational coding methods to study the underlying theories of specific evidence-based treatment approaches.  Currently, she has extended this work to collaborate on two projects examining mechanisms of Motivational Interviewing with at-risk college student drinkers. In 2010, Dr. Magill was awarded an NIAAA K23 Award to study common factor processes in behavioral interventions with alcohol use disorders."

S'My research agenda lies at the intersection of environmental justice and health, social movements to re-embed economic development within social relations, and sustainable ecosystems.  As societies grapple with reshaping energy policies and technologies, I examine related environmental justice implications by analyzing how sustainability is framed and operationalized in each context &#150; and who has the power to create these frames. If sustainability is at least partly social (as EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and others have stated), then I contend social scientists must examine social sustainability of energy systems before policies establish and fund them as sources of renewable energy.   For example, in policy discourses on climate change adaptation strategies, nuclear power is frequently framed as a renewable &#150; and thus more sustainable &#150; energy source due to its lower carbon emissions.  My research agenda problematizes this assumption.  Specifically, I examine social aspects of rural energy development by focusing on political-economic and health outcomes of nuclear energy production.  I do so using data from in-depth, community-level fieldwork, teasing apart how uranium\'s complex legacy intersects with current efforts to create nuclear renaissance on the Colorado Plateau.  I specifically interrogate how various energy development efforts interact with rural communities, emergent social movements, ecosystems, residents\' economic and physical well-being, and democratic development of truly renewable energy systems.  My research inquiries have now expanded to examining these variables within the context of hydraulic fracturing.<br /><br />My dissertation and my current writing analyzes the emergence of competing discourses and patterns of political mobilization in response to southern Colorado\'s proposed Pi&#241;on Ridge Uranium Mill, the first such mill permitted since the Cold War\'s end.  A Rural Sociological Society dissertation fellowship helped fund my research.  Employing multi-community surveys, in-depth interviews, regulatory and archival analyses, and Polanyi\'s double movement concept, I identified and examined conditions that foster movements often detrimental in character to long-term social, political-economic, and ecological well-being in the region.  Within this matrix of outcomes, I continue to examine nuclear power\'s degree of social sustainability as experienced by community leaders, corporate actors, regulatory agents, public health officers, and (other) residents in and around rural communities like Nucla and Naturita, Colorado, most proximate to the Pi&#241;on Ridge Mill site.  My research protocol has local-level policy relevance, particularly for rural communities possessing complex histories with natural resource extraction and dependency. Yet, with these communities nested in global market systems, my research agenda has a national and international scope as well, helping further comparative research into sustainable development policy initiatives at a variety of levels.<br /><br />As a public sociologist, I focus on energy development\'s social sustainability because I feel compelled to help rural communities develop as safely, securely, ecologically, and autonomously as possible.  As an applied sociologist, I believe that scholars\' most important work is done when helping create and refine policies and programs useful to marginalized communities.  For years, I\'ve examined intersections between rural well-being, political economic context, environmental health, and energy policy, expanding scholarly discourse while helping local communities progress.  For example, my thesis research analyzed emergent environmental health movements and contested claims of illness surrounding an abandoned uranium mill site in southeastern Utah, a site now surrounded by booming uranium and oil/gas development.  Outcomes of this research include my articles: "Left in the Dust: Uranium\'s Legacy and Victims of Mill Tailings Exposure in Monticello, Utah" in Society and Natural Resources (Dec. 2010) and "Community Development Among Toxic Tailings: An Interactional Case Study of Extralocal Institutions and Environmental Health," forthcoming in Community Development.  Importantly, I also received the American Sociological Association\'s Spivack Community Action Research Initiative Grant, through which Dr. Peggy Petrzelka and I helped local activists conduct their own popular epidemiological surveys.  My long-term graduate internship with the Western Rural Development Center and my absentee landownership research with Peggy Petrzelka also kept me grounded in the land grant ethos of policy-relevant community engagement.<br /><br />While my investment in uranium communities continues, my interests have expanded to hydraulic fracturing in Western and Northeastern US.  \'Fracking\', also framed as a source of sustainable, clean energy, has a host of problems associated with it that have yet to be adequately studied.  I aim to change that, since rural populations once again bear the brunt of much of this energy development.  As such, I am developing a collaborative pilot study of \'fracking\'s\' social sustainability outcomes.  This research agenda has long-term comparative potential, can inform energy policy, and help empower community residents as active agents in their own social, political-economic, and ecological well-being.'

S'Stephanie studies sociology of environment and globalization/ development, with a particular focus on natural resource development.  She focuses on the interactions between natural resource dependent communities, resource extraction\'s historical legacies and contemporary effects, and the impact of related grassroots mobilization efforts on US public institutions. Stephanie is particularly concerned with how we define and politicize sustainability within these contexts, as the US and other countries re-shape their energy policies.  Stephanie recently received her Ph.D. in Environmental/Natural Resource Sociology and Sociology of Globalization from Utah State University, stuydying under Dr. Peggy Petrzelka.  She also worked on her Sociology Master\'s degree at Utah State, completing her thesis in 2007.  Truman State University was Stephanie\'s undergraduate home, where she studied Sociology/Anthropology, English Composition and Postcolonial Literature, and Philosophy.  <br /><br />Throughout, Stephanie\'s research focused on environmental justice, environmental health, and political-economic contexts surrounding energy development, particularly in rural communities in the American West.  Stephanie primarily examines impacts of uranium mining and milling, but she has has begun to interrogate hydraulic fracking\'s environmental sociological outcomes as well.  Her recent dissertation work focused on emergent social movements surrounding the Pi&#241;on Ridge Uranium Mill in southwestern Colorado.  As the first such mill sited in the US since the end of the Cold War, Stephanie contends that observing related environmental justice, health, and grassroots movement contexts helps social scientists identify and anticipate sociological outcomes likely to emerge as societies re-examine energy development options in an era of climate change mitigation.  Her publications include: "Left in the Dust: Uranium\'s Legacy and the Victims of Mill Tailings Exposure in Monticello, Utah" in Society and Natural Resources, which examined uranium\'s environmental legacy on the Colorado Plateau; and "Community Development among Toxic Tailings: An Interactional Case Study of Community Health and Extralocal Institutions," which examines the interactions between grassroots movements and public institutional response, as from the ATSDR.  Currently, Stephanie teaches graduate seminars in natural resource sociology and environmental health at Brown and is working on several articles and a book manuscript.'

S'I consider myself a social cognitive scientist&#151;an identity that has been shaped by all three traditional aspects of my academic career.  As a researcher, my interests have revolved around the fundamental cognitive tools that allow humans to navigate the social world, a theme that compellingly merges the cognitive with the social.  As a teacher I have had the opportunity to teach courses at that same intersection of fields, such as Social Psychology and Cognitive Science. Finally, my previous administrative activity has focused on the Institute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences at the University of Oregon, an interdisciplinary forum for researchers who share an interest in exploring the mind within its social context.  I am currently president-elect of the Society of Philosophy and Psychology, which has a long tradition of studying the mind from multiple disciplinary perspectives.<br /><br />Social cognitive science is the most suitable category to subsume all of these activities, and it expresses my strong commitment to study the human mind as both a cognitive and a social phenomenon. Below I describe briefly my three central research topics:  Social cognition of mental states; intentionality and moral judgment; and explanations of behavior.<br /><br /><i>Social Cognition of Mental States</i><br /><br />In making sense of human behavior, people connect the observed with the unobserved&#151;they find meaning in behavior by inferring mental states. This ability is essential for succeeding in the social world: Without mental state inferences, observed behaviors turn blurry and indistinct, future behaviors are difficult to predict, and communicating with others becomes utterly perplexing.<br /><br />My research on people\' capacity to infer mental states pursues two paths. One examines the conceptual framework that underlies this capacity (people\'s "theory of mind"), and I have written about its evolutionary, developmental, linguistic, and cultural dimensions (Malle, 2002a, 2002c, 2004, 2005a, 2008b; Malle & Holbrook, in press).  Many psychological processes rely on this framework (Malle & Hodges, 2005), and in my second path I examine the perhaps most central of these processes: people\'s inferences of others\' mental states (Malle & Pearce, 2001; Malle, 2005e). Each time people encounter a behavior, they make many inferences simultaneously&#151;e.g., about goals, beliefs, emotions&#151;and the question arises both how these inferences relate to each other and how they relate to other judgments, such as about age, gender, and personality.  In a series of experiments funded by the National Science Foundation I test a possible hierarchy among these inferences. Initial studies suggest such a hierarchy ranging from the simplest judgments of a behavior\'s intentionality and the actor\'s goal to more complex and difficult judgments about the actor\'s thoughts and personality characteristics.<br /><br /><i>Intentionality and Moral Judgment</i><br /><br />My earlier work on intentionality (Malle & Knobe, 1997, 2001; Malle, Moses, & Baldwin, 2001) examined the folk concept of intentionality that people bring to social cognition&#151;the specific conditions that have to be met in order for a behavior to be considered intentional. In an extension into the legal realm, my former Ph.D. student Sarah Nelson and I compared people\'s folk concept of intentionality to the legal definitions of the terms intent and intentionality and found several contradictions between the two, which opens significant room for misperceptions, misunderstandings, and flawed judgments in legal proceedings (Malle & Nelson, 2003). Ongoing studies in my lab examine in more detail how people make judgments of intentionality about legal cases, how the results of their reasoning compare to those of the legal system, and how the two may be reconciled.<br /><br /> A second line of research examines empirically how intentionality judgments influence blame and how, conversely, blame might influence intentionality judgments (Malle, 2006c; Malle & Guglielmo, 2006; Guglielmo & Malle, submitted).  My Ph.D. student Steve Guglielmo and I have been examining to what extent people\'s moral evaluations of a behavior cloud their judgments of intentionality about that behavior. Such a process would present a serious challenge to the legal system if judgments of intentionality, which are normally used to ground and justify judgments of guilt and punishment, are already guided by people\'s intuitions about guilt and punishment.  So far, our results suggest that previous claims of such a biasing effect (Knobe, 2003) do not hold true once the cases and questions are presented in a clear, unambiguous way&#151;taking into account the way people think about intentionality.  Ongoing collaborations with a legal scholar in Hawaii and two psychologists in Japan are extending this work across disciplinary and cultural boundaries.  <br /><br /><i>Explanations of Behavior</i><br /><br />Few theories in social psychology have received as much attention as attribution theory.  The theory\'s assumption that humans actively interpret and explain behavioral and social events has led to many insights in the domains of social influence, self-regulation, relationships, and health.  However, after nearly 40 years of research, the dominant version of attribution theory (Kelley, 1967)&#151;characterizing explanations as referring to either "person causes" or "situation causes"&#151;remains highly underspecified, has surprisingly little empirical support, and does not provide a comprehensive account of what people actually do when they explain behavior.<br /><br />      By studying naturally occurring explanations&#151;that is, by letting people use their own words rather than forcing pre-defined rating scales on them&#151;we have developed a folk-conceptual theory of behavior explanations that specifies people\'s conceptual assumptions underlying those explanations and generates novel predictions about various explanatory phenomena (Malle, 1999, 2001b, 2004, 2007c; Malle et al., 2000; O\'Laughlin & Malle, 2002).  According to this theory, people\'s explanations of behavior cannot be properly understood when explanations are categorized as "person" or "situation" causes.  Rather, behavior explanations must be divided into multiple distinct modes (such as causes, reasons, and causal histories) and, within these modes, into specific types (such as belief vs. desire reasons). These are the distinctions that matter when people construct and perceive explanations. <br /><br />      To illustrate, in a meta-analysis of the well-known actor-observer asymmetry in attribution (Jones & Nisbett, 1972), the effect size across 173 published studies was zero (Malle, 2006).  Thus, when explanations are couched in terms of traditional attribution theory (referring to either person or situation causes), no difference can be detected between people\'s explanations, as actors, of their own behavior and, as observers, of other people\'s behavior. By contrast, when couched in terms of the folk-conceptual theory, strong and reliable differences emerge (Malle, Knobe, & Nelson, 2007).  The fact that these classifications have predictive power&#151;not only for actor-observer asymmetries but also for group-individual comparisons (O\'Laughlin   Malle, 2002) and impression management (Malle et al., 2000)&#151;suggests that the folk-conceptual theory of explanation captures the breakpoints, or joints, in the human endeavor of explaining behavior.<br /><br /><i>References</i><br /><br />Kelley, H.

S'Anthony Mansell has studied lung growth and maturation, concentrating on lung macromechanics in humans and lung micromechanics in animal models. His early studies showed a predisposition for airway closure in infancy and early childhood, partly explaining a vulnerability to gas exchange problems during viral infections at this early stage of growth. This finding led to studies of lung elastic recoil, which showed a direct relationship between the predisposition for airway closure and a relative deficiency in recoil in young children. More studies of lung macromechanics in the distribution of ventilation in children and adolescents were applied to clinical manifestations of scoliosis, asthma, thalassemia, and cystic fibrosis.<br /><br />His studies in animal models have focused on relationships between mechanical strain produced by growth of the chest wall and the development of lung parenchyma. Using cat and piglet models, his studies showed that unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis inhibited growth of lung parenchyma on the affected side. Later studies in postmortem piglet lungs investigated growth-related changes in lung elastic moduli and the development of interdependence between lung parenchyma and extrapulmonary arteries and airways. <br /><br />Clinical research has included studies of respiratory distress syndrome, sickle cell disease, altitude sickness, thalassemia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, scoliosis, bronchiolitis and hypopituitarism.<br /><br />A recent interest has been in the field of respiratory psychophysics, especially as applied to life-threatening asthma in adolescents.'

S'In a project funded by the National Science Foundation, the behavior of electrons in liquid helium is being studied. When an electron is injected into helium, it forces open a spherical cavity with a diameter of 40 Angstroms from which helium atoms are excluded. The size of this cavity is such as to minimize the sum of the zero-point energy of the electron, the surface energy and the energy associated with any externally-applied pressure. If the electron is excited to a higher quantum state, the size and shape of the cavity changes. Recently, these excited state bubbles have been detected and their properties studied. When the electron is optically excited to the higher energy state, the surface of the bubble begins to move very rapidly. As a result of this violent motion, it is possible that the bubble breaks into two parts. <br /><br />By application of a negative pressure to an electron bubble it is possible to make the bubble explode. The bubble can then grow large enough to be recorded with a video camera. Currently experiments are underway in which an electron bubble is repeatedly exploded using a sound wave. Through the use of this novel technique, our group has been able to make a movie showing the motion of a single electron. <br /><br />New techniques have been developed in our laboratory at Brown that make it possible to perform ultrasonic experiments at very high frequency. Femtosecond light pulses are used to generate and to detect short sound pulses and also to study the flow of heat in small structures. The Fourier spectrum of the sound pulses extends up to 1 Terahertz. Brown University has licensed the technology that has been developed to an established metrology company, and they have produced a commercial version of the equipment. This has become a standard technique for the measurement of the thickness of opaque films in semiconductor chips and is now in use by all of the leading chip fabricators world-wide.'

S'Our research concerns the process by which the mammalian kidney regulates its blood flow in the face of fluctuations of arterial blood pressure.  Blood flow to each renal tubule is controlled by an ensemble of two nonlinear systems; one is sensitive to the flow dependent concentration of NaCl in the tubular fluid at a specific tubular site, and the other responds to changes in blood pressure.  These two processes interact because they act on a single group of smooth muscle cells in arterioles supplying the renal tubule.<br /><br />We have developed a mathematical model of pressure, flow, and NaCl concentration in a renal tubule, and of the action of these two regulatory processes on smooth muscle cells of the arteriole.  The model successfully simulates experimentally measured oscillations in each of the regulatory systems, and also predicts a nonlinear interaction, whose presence we have confirmed in experimental records of blood flow.<br /><br />The slower oscillation of the two has been found to change to an irregular fluctuation in animals with high blood pressure.  The change is known as a bifurcation, and the change leads to a state with characterists of deterministic chaos.  Our goal is to use the model to determine the cause of the bifurcation, which should lead to testable predictions about causality.  <br /><br />Our working hypothesis about the cause of the bifurcation arises from our observation that renal tubules use signal propagation over the walls of arterioles to influence each other.  We also found that the strength of this signal propagation was increased several fold in animals with high blood pressure.  Renal tubules act in concert with each other to respond to naturally occurring fluctuations in blood pressure.  When signal strength increses in high blood pressure, additionl tubules will be recruited to the ensemble of synchronized tubules, including those with different anatomical properties.  This recruitment will add an asymmetry to the ensemble which may induce the bifurcation to chaos.'

S'Changes in channel activity are known to regulate neuronal gene expression, cell death, and communication.  Glutamate receptors play key roles in certain forms of synaptic plasticity, and the failure to regulate these receptors can cause seizure disorders and neurodegenerative disease. We use molecular biological and patch-clamp techniques to study glutamate receptors in neurons to determine how their properties are modulated by kinases, such as CaM-Kinase II.  My lab has mainly been studying kainate type of glutamate receptors.  We are interested in the trafficking and localization of kainate receptors to pre- and post-synaptic sites.  We have found that the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) family of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins can mediate kainate receptor clustering and anchoring at the membrane surface by binding the intracellular C-terminal tails of the receptors. Additionally, the same molecules provide a scaffold for the assembly of transduction complexes, thus coupling kainate receptors to downstream signaling processes.<br /><br />Calcium influx through the related L-type calcium channels, CaV1.2 and CaV1.3,  performs an array of functions that include promoting neuronal survival,  controlling calcium signaling to the nucleus, influencing the rate of neurite outgrowth, stabilizing dendritic arbors (Marshall et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2006).  We have shown that the growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) rapidly potentiates neuronal CaV1.2 channel activity via an IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase- (RTK-), PI-3 kinase- and Akt-dependent pathway that culminates in Src-dependent phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue on CaV1.2 (Blair and Marshall, 1997; Blair et al., 1999; Bence-Hanulec et al., 2000). In the long-term, IGF-1 and CaV1.2 have been shown to promote neuronal survival via regulation of specific transcription factors, including CREB.  We recently found that CaV1.3 channel activity is also rapidly potentiated by IGF-1, and that, unlike the IGF-1 regulation of CaV1.2, the CaV1.3 signaling pathway involves IP3-sensitive stores, CaMKII, and phosphorylation of the CaV1.3 EF hand motif. Mechanistically, we find that the potentiation arises from increased activation of CaV1.3 at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and, within minutes, produces increased levels of phospho-CREB, a transcription factor strongly associated with promoting dendritic development and neuronal survival.  We additionally found that CaV1.3 modulation is dependent on the scaffold proteins Shank and Homer.  Shank binds to the C-terminus of CaV1.3a to recruit Homer and tether CaV1.3 to IP3-sensitive stores.'

S"A major focus of our research is regulation of glutamate receptors that  play key roles in neuronal communication.  Failure to regulate these receptors can cause seizure disorders and neurodegeneration such as, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease.  We have identified proteins that control the movement and localization of these receptors at synapses with the aim of designing drugs that prevent neuronal death in disease states.   We also study the mechanisms by which growth factors, such as IGF 1, promote neuronal development. Our work demonstrates that growth factors enhance the activity of L-type calcium channels to regulate dendritic branching, spine formation, and long-term survival. <br /><br />I became interested in this line of research because I was interested in processes such as learning and memory. Receptors are key elements in the communication of neurons and by studying them we hope to understand at the molecular level how the brain functions."

S'The broad goal of my research program is to investigate gene environment interactions and their individual and combined impact on human disease, with a particular focus on the impact of the environment on epigenetic regulation of the genome.  My research has focused on two distinct, yet highly related biologic processes, that of environmental carcinogenesis and that of human development. In those settings, I am studying alterations to epigenetic marks, which may be responsible, in a significant part, for cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, common and rare diseases of childhood including behavioral disorders.  We focus on DNA methylation and miRNA expression as our key epigenetic mechanisms of interest.<br />   This research aims to provide a sound scientific basis for this emerging paradigm that is taking shape on the heels of the realization that there are fetal origins to many adult diseases.   My laboratory is taking approaches both in controlled in-vitro experiments, as well as in utilizing the power of epidemiology to study the effects of the environment on multiple facets of epigenetic regulation, and thereby creating a novel interdisciplinary approach to understanding the pathogenesis of human disease.  Paramount to meeting my objectives is creating a collaborative and multidisciplinary team of clinicians, epidemiologists, biologists, and statisticians who, by working with me, are committed to combining efforts to reach these goals.  Such a combined effort is absolutely necessary to accomplish this work, and will certainly open up entirely new avenues for research both here at Brown and beyond.'

S'The basic laws of quantum and statistical physics were discovered many decades ago, yet we continue to be amazed by the rich variety of behaviors and phases that emerge from these laws. Experiments on several classes of layered systems, on transport through nanostructures, and on nanoscale aqueous actinide complexes, call for a deeper theoretical understanding of strongly correlated electronic systems.  The statistics of dynamical systems such as turbulent flows also require the accurate treatment of strong many-body correlations.  I work with systematic analytical and numerical methods to establish phase diagrams, to study charge-transfer at surfaces and in aqueous environments, and to describe statistically nonlinear systems driven out of equilibrium. Attaining a better understanding of this physics is of both fundamental and practical import.  <br /><br />On intellectual grounds, my research pushes the boundaries of what can be done to ascertain emergent properties of strongly correlated systems. It bears on 6 of the 125 outstanding scientific questions recently identified by Science Magazine: (1) Is there a unified theory explaining all correlated electron systems? (2) What is the pairing mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity?  (3) What is the structure of water?  (4) Can we develop a general theory of the dynamics of turbulent flows and the motion of granular materials?  (5) Will mathematicians unleash the power of the Navier-Stokes equations?

S'Kristen Matteson\'s main research focus is heavy uterine bleeding. Although the technical medical definitions of heavy bleeding, "menorrhagia" and "menometorrhagia" are often used for research in this area, the majority of women complaining of heavy or irregular bleeding do not meet the clinical criteria for menorrhagia and menometorrhagia. Given this discordance between patient experience and clinical measures, standardized outcome measures for patient experience with heavy uterine bleeding are needed. Dr. Matteson is currently working to develop such measures. Subsequently, she will design clinical research comparing these outcomes, in addition to clinical measures, for medical treatments of these diverse disorders. <br /><br />Dr. Matteson is also researching the utilization of a women\'s emergency facility for medical attention for non-emergent medical problems.  Given the increasing volume of patients being seen in emergency rooms, this study will help to identify factors that lead women to seek non-urgent care in an urgent care setting.  This pilot study also aims to lay the foundation of future studies investigating the use of emergency facilities for gynecologic and obstetric problems and defining levels of urgency for such facilities. <br /><br />As a mentor and preceptor of resident research, Kristen Matteson is involved with projects assessing guidelines and protocols for treatment in obstetrics and gynecology.  She is the co-investigator and mentor for a resident research project that is evaluating whether or not obstetric providers are following the Centers for Disease Control recommendation for Group B Streptococcal prophylaxis in penicillin allergic patients.

S'The research of RKM continues to focus on (1) calculation of sea level history from orbital forcing data and (2) the forward modeling of stratigraphy as the interaction between subsiding basins and high frequency glacioeustasy. The successful completion of Mike Ye\'s PhD dissertation (highlights provided in Ye, et al., 1995) brings collaboration with U. Texas at Austin researchers Bill Galloway and Cliff Frohlich to a momentary pause, awaiting new graduate students to pick up on the opportunity. Mike Ye\'s project was a large success in the integration of high frequency glacioeustasy into Gulf Coast regional Miocene stratigraphy. The next step is probably to apply these concepts at the level of stratigraphy within a single oil field. There is considerable interest at this level because of ongoing plans for in-field drilling and enhanced secondary recovery schemes.  Incorporation of orbital forcing of high frequency glacioeustasy into reservoir characterization in carbonate oil fields is now approaching ""off the shelf"" status. RKM notes, ""There is a lot of interest out there, but there is also a lot of \'too busy syndrome\'. Our approach to reservoir characterization will probably have to be part of a turn-key service built around instant interpretation of high tech well logs or integrated into more traditional reservoir characterization studies. The service companies are interested, but again there is a lot of inertia for tried and true methods of picking up standard fees for standard services."" Much of the interest in these applications centers around Cretaceous through late Paleozoic applications. These time scales stretch orbital forcing concepts beyond the realm of the astronomers. RKM is presently making a major effort to simplify the orbital forcing calculations to the point that they can be applied throughout the Phanerozoic with the caveat that phase relations among the planets may have changed through time. However, alternative calculations of sea level history are sufficiently different that geologists should be able to sort out the problem.'

S'Recent research projects include methods for turbulent drag reduction, the manipulation of small paramagnetic particles with magnetic fields to form self-assembled structures in a suspension, active suspensions of microorganisms or artificial swimmers, and problems relating to the transport and coagulation of platelets in blood flow. In these projects, we have developed direct numerical simulations and theoretical models that characterize the microstructure and help understand the overall processes.<br /><br />In a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored project aimed at reducing drag on ship hulls, we have been studying the dynamics of micro-bubbles injected into turbulent shear flows and how these may alter the near-wall flow. The technique of micro-bubble injection is known to work in laboratory experiments but there has been little theory as to how drag reduction is achieved or how it might be scaled. Previously we had provided the first demonstration of drag reduction through a direct numerical simulation. We have developed new simulations for spatially-developing channel flows that now provide a direct basis for comparison with experiments. Our simulations have further identified bubble-bubble contacts as an important factor in bubble dispersion, which in turn controls the persistence of drag reduction. Drag reduction may be enhanced by the presence of a gas film at the walls. Papers on this work were presented at the 2nd Int. Symp. Seawater Drag Reduction, held in Busan, South Korea in 2005.<br /><br />With National Science Foundation support, we are studying the dynamics of paramagnetic beads in suspensions. These beads (~ 1 micron in size) are commonly used in biomedical testing and can be treated to respond to biochemical agents. When in suspension they can be manipulated by magnetic fields to form self-assembled structures such as chains that can be used in micro-devices to create optical filters, or as flow pumps and actuators. They can be used also to produce mixing in a fluid, or for manipulating individual cells in biomedical applications. We have developed new simulation methods to accurately predict the interactions between magnetic beads. We have demonstrated the strong role of 3D-geometry of the flow device on the chains that form, and verified these results against available experiments. We are presently investigating the effects of unsteady or rotating magnetic fields. Surface physics and short-range interactions play a role too. We have been using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to investigate the link between these nano-scale and mescopic features to link them to larger scale simulations.<br /><br />In a new project, we are studying the dynamics of platelet coagulation in blood flow in both large blood vessels and in small capillaries.'

S'I currently am researching a book to be entitled Tokyo Modern: The Dominance of the Middle-class in Twentieth Century Japan.<br /><br />Throughout the centuries, the cultural ethos of particular social classes have stamped their images indelibly on Japanese history.  The tenth and eleventh centuries were the Age of the Aristocrat, when noble families in Kyoto amassed fortunes, took their leisure in palatial mansions, and ushered in a golden age of high culture by becoming both patrons and practitioners of tanka poetry, courtly gagaku music, and other patrician arts.  Samurai turned the medieval period into the Age of the Warrior, adding martial arts and the virtues of bravery, courage, and loyalty to the lexicon of Japanese self-identity.  During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the merchants and artisans of Edo and other cities forged an Age of the Commoner, and playwrights for the Kabuki theater, wood-block print designers, and haiku poets created new art forms that both identified the values of the merchant class and made up what we now consider as the primary hallmarks of traditional Japanese culture.  In similar fashion, the twentieth century was to become the Age of the Middle Class.<br /><br />What I plan is a narrative history that will offer fresh ways to appreciate and interpret the significance of the middle class in modern Japanese (and world) history.  The middle class began to take shape at the turn of the century in Tokyo, and during the next two decades it quickly assumed a national importance by embracing modernity, introducing new models of family organization and novel conceptions of gender roles, and asserting itself as cultural arbiters in regard to housing, fashion, recreation, and consumerism.  As a consequence, even though its numbers remained small in the pre-World War II years, the new middle class significantly influenced how all Japanese thought about themselves and how they expressed their aspiration to be regarded as an integral member of the international community of modern, cosmopolitan societies.  The war years from 1931 to 1945 cast a long shadow over the middle class and called its values into severe question.  In the postwar decades, however, the middle class reasserted itself.  Not surprisingly, given its ambitions to cultural leadership, as it did so the middle class also became the prism through which foreigners viewed Japan and judged its progress in achieving modernity.<br /><br />The above thumbnail sketch of the evolution of the middle class draws attention to the substructure of topics and arguments that will both support the narrative in Tokyo Modern and link together its individual chapters.  Those chief interpretative themes include:<br />&#149;&#9;Middle-class urbanity was the predominant mode by which the Japanese experienced modernity.  That is, rather than seeing the modern condition as something that appeared first in the West and then was imported (i.e., copied) by non-Western peoples, the experience of the Japanese middle class suggests that increasingly Tokyoites conceived of modernity as a universal, transcultural, transnational phenomena.  Put somewhat differently, being middle class was a way for Japanese both to feel modern and share a cosmopolitanism with people in Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and to continue to be Japanese, in the sense that their particular brand of middle-class modernity incorporated specific elements from their own cultural traditions.<br />&#149;&#9;The concept of middle class advanced in Tokyo Modern defines the middle class not just by occupation and income but, more fundamentally, by lifestyle and cultural values.  Thus, I will be looking closely at fashion, housing, recreation, consumerism, education, and gender roles within families.<br />&#149;&#9;The making of the middle class was a lengthy process that occupied most of the twentieth century.  The dominance of the so-called "new middle class" that reached full visibility in the 1980s cannot be divorced from the appearance of the first middle class in the 1910s and 1920s.  Consequently, Tokyo Modern will contain chapters on both the pre- and postwar decades and will highlight the importance of transwar continuities.<br />&#149;&#9;The middle class version of modernity did not go uncontested.  In the 1920s cheeky youth, political radicals, avant-garde habituates of the entertainment demimonde, and criminal women embraced lifestyles that challenged middle-class conventions.  In the late 1930s and 1940s, as Japan slipped into war with China and then the Anglo-American powers, self-styled "Japanists" and members of the reactionary right launched an attack on what they saw as decadent middle-class values.  At century\'s end, disapproving feminists, conservative politicians, and teenage delinquents who bullied fellow students or engaged in "subsidized friendship" with middle-aged patrons again called into question the virtues of a middle-class lifestyle.  Tokyo Modern contains chapters on such dissident views not just because they are interesting and important in their own right but also because reactions to criticism helped shape the way that the middle class chose to represent itself.<br />&#149;&#9;If the middle class was fundamental to how the Japanese came to define themselves, it also became the prism through which the outside world viewed Japan.  Across the twentieth century, the Japanese were seen successively as backward Asiatics, war mongers, and economic animals, only to emerge by century\'s end as a cosmopolitan people who had a great deal in common with their counterparts in other modern societies, and whose accomplishments &#151; as expressed in haute couture, sushi and sak&#233;, modern glass and steel architecture, and movies, anime, and Japan Pop! &#151; enriched other cultures.<br /><br />As its title indicates, this book will focus on Tokyo.  One reason for this, of course, is that the middle class emerged first in Tokyo and, in many ways, the Tokyo middle class became the nation\'s model.  Second, because of Tokyo\'s significance, a great deal of the scholarly literature that will provide a foundation for this narrative history focuses on the middle class in that city.  Moreover, several sometimes overlooked or recently established archives (such as the collections at The House of Shiseid?, the NHK Museum and Library, the Salt and Tobacco Museum and Library, and the Ad Museum) contain materials that illuminate lifestyles in twentieth-century Tokyo.  Finally, maintaining a focus on one city will permit me to tell the story of the middle class in intimate detail.<br /><br />As suggested above, I will draw my information from recent scholarly literature and my own research.  Happily, several excellent monographs about the Tokyo middle class have appeared in the past few years, in both Japanese and English.  As models of the historical profession, most of these tend to focus on particular, carefully defined topics (for instance, Ishizuka Hiromichi for middle-class occupations in the Taish? decades, Minami Hiroshi on urban lifestyles, Narita Ry?ichi on sexuality, Jordon Sand on homes and interior decorating, Kathleen S. Uno on childrearing, Christine R. Yano on popular music, and Kendall H. Brown on the Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements, to name just a few) and most conclude by 1941 or begin their story after 1945.  In Tokyo Modern I fully intend to use the findings of this excellent literature to create a more holistic portrait of the middle class that weaves together the pre- and postwar experiences.  To this body of scholarship I will add what I learn from my own research in archives, such as those named above, that have materials explicating middle-class lifestyles.  Fortunately, I was able to investigate the holdings of those achieves during a two-month stay at Keio University in 2004-2005.<br /><br />In sum, I intend Tokyo Modern to be an encompassing narrative &#151; distinctive in its interpretational thrust, topical coverage, and chronological scope &#151; that explicates the growth of the middle class in Japan, explains its historical significance, and underscores what it means to be modern in a universal, transcultural context.<br /><br />I also hope that Tokyo Modern will be richly illustrated.  The narrative can carry some chapters, but there is a wonderful treasure house of material, ranging from matchbox covers to department store ads to postcards, that can be used to great effect to enhance the discussion of middle-class consumerism and lifestyles.'

S'My research interests include respiratory muscle training, mechanical behavior and neural activation patterns of the respiratory muscles, effects of disease or injury on respiratory function (e.g., diaphragm paralysis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson disease, flail chest, muscular dystrophy), and the estimation of ventilation from body surface measurements.  I have been a leader in advancing the science of measuring ventilation from body surface measurements and that of imaging the diaphragm using ultrasound.<br /><br />The majority of my work has been directed at evaluating respiratory muscle function in health and disease.  My initial research in this area focused on evaluating determinants of respiratory muscle endurance in healthy individuals.  Among my significant contributions in this area were the findings that mean inspiratory flow rate, operational lung volume, and muscle energetics were key determinants of inspiratory muscle endurance.  By extending these observations to patients with tetraplegia, Parkinsons Disease, diaphragm paralysis, and flail chest, we obtained a better understanding of respiratory muscle dysfunction in patients with varied diseases of the chest wall.  While completing the above studies, it became apparent that the tools available to assess respiratory muscle function were limited due to their invasive nature.  Consequently I became interested in developing ultrasound as a non-invasive tool to assess diaphragm function.  After determining that diaphragm thickness could be accurately measured using ultrasound, I found that measurements of thickness had physiologic relevance.  Specifically in a series of studies we noted that 1) the resting cross-sectional area of the diaphragm was proportional to its strength, 2) changes in diaphragm thickness during inspiration were proportional to its shortening, 3) disuse of the diaphragm leads to atrophy, 4) strength training and anabolic steroids result in diaphragm hypertrophy, and 5) diaphragm paralysis can be accurately and non-invasively diagnosed using ultrasound, and 6) ultrasound can be employed to assess diaphragm activity during mechanical ventilation. Finally, I have been active developing non-invasive means of monitoring ventilation.  By utilizing models that we developed, changes in chest wall dimensions can provide measurements of ventilation with an accuracy of 15% in ambulatory individuals. Quantitating ventilation using such non-invasive means would improve current methods of assessing risk from environmental exposures to air-borne particulates and toxic gases.'

S'CURRENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES<br />Dr. McGarvey is working on two large projects. The first is a long-term series of NIH supported studies examining the genetic, physiologic, and behavioral influences on cardiovascular disease risk factors in Samoa and American Samoa, and newer research in applied interventions on non-communicable diseases. One recent project is a R18 translational research grant project on the impact of community health workers on the management of type 2 diabetes in American Samoa in collaboration with a primary care health facility. The newest project is a genome-wide association study of adiposity and metabolic phenotypes in Samoa. This will study will also attempt to detect specific interactions between genetic variants and individual level dietary and physical activity factors on adiposity and metabolic phenotypes. Based on prior studies in 2002-03 analysis and manuscript preparation continues on determining genetic susceptibilities and gene* environment interactions that determine obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The second project is on the parasitic infection Schistosoma japonicum in The Philippines. His current research focuses on two studies in The Philippines. The first is a multidisciplinary study of the ecology and transmission of schistosomiasis and how its distribution in space, time, and people is influenced by the anthropogenic changes to the environment due to rice farming. The second project focuses on the interactive influences of puberty, malnutrition, and specific immune responses on the development of partial resistance to infection.'

S'My lab is interested in the way genes interact to control interesting processes in complex organisms. We use the non-pathogenic fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system that is complex enough to be interesting and simple enough to be genetically and experimentally tractable. In addition, a substantial fraction of critical genes and proteins are conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates. Of particular interest at the moment is dissection of the genetic, molecular and neural bases of behavior, with sexual behavior serving as a model. An unexpected but exciting spin off from this work has been the identification of genes involved in age-dependent behavioral and neural degeneration.<br /><br /><br />Sexual behavior in Drosophila involves stereotypic behaviors in both sexes. A screen based on alterations in an easily scored female behavior has yielded a number of potentially interesting loci, with two genes being substantially characterized. Mutations in both of these affect both sexes, altering sex-specific behavior and sex-specific neural development. Both genes encode DNA binding transcriptional regulators with limited patterns of expression within the brain and CNS at the time when sex-specific behaviors are established. The encoded proteins have a high degree of similarity to some human proteins, although it has not been shown that they are functional homologs. The consequences of loss of expression, or inappropriate gain of expression, of either of these genes on the development of individual neurons is in progress. The regulatory regions of these genes, and alterations within their proteins are currently being used to dissect the nature and function of the sex-specific nervous system.<br /><br /><br />As part of the studies on sexual behavior, two genes were identified that give rise to age-dependent behavioral or neural degeneration. Mutations in one of these loci lead to early death accompanied by massive apoptotic cell death in the brain. The encoded protein has a novel and previously uncharacterized human homolog. Mutations in the other gene do not shorten life span under optimal laboratory conditions but lead to alterations in sexual and non-sexual behaviors as well as general loss of mobility and control of body carriage. Although the brains of these animals appear grossly normal, the structural integrity of the brain appears to be diminished. Candidate loci for genetic interaction with this gene have been identified, as have related human genes.'

We use the non-pathogenic fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Since a major fraction of critical genes, proteins, and developmental and neural mechanisms are conserved between flies and vertebrates, a substantial fraction of our findings are directly or indirectly informative about humans.<br /><br />Much or our current work focuses on the gene and neural networks controlling sexual behavior and orientation. Since males and females generate sex-specific behaviors, this is a powerful system in which to dissect development of mutually exclusive behaviors.'

S'Meisel\'s research focuses on nineteenth- and twentieth-century British political history, and particularly the cultural life within and surrounding politics.  This has involved studies of the various ways that politicians "performed" their roles in Parliament and "out-of-doors," and the ways in which images of politicians and political life were communicated to the broader public.  <br /><br />His first book, <i>Public Speech and the Culture of Public Life in the Age of Gladstone</i> (2001), examined the factors underlying the growth of oratory as a major function of politics, religion, and the law in the 19th century, and the ways that institutions and people adapted to the increasing demands that the practices of public speaking imposed.  He has continued to explore the role of oratory and related aspects of political performance (for example, humor) in several articles and essays in books.<br /><br />A second book, <i>Harry Furniss -- "The Humours of Parliament":  A View of Late Victorian Political Culture</i> (in press), co-authored with Gareth Cordery, reconstructs and contextualizes a popular magic lantern show given by the famous cartoonist and parliamentary obsrever in the early 1890s, as well as its tours of North America and Australia.  In addition to examining the popular presentation and representation of Parliament during this critical period, the book also offers a rare in-depth account of an important Victorian performance genre.<br /><br />Another research interest is the history of education in Britain, and especially higher education.  The <i>Public Speech book</i>, for example, includes a significant discussion of the ways that speaking exercises became incorporated into education and professional training at varoius levels.  An important theme of the <i>Furniss</i> book is the ways in which the magic lantern show functioned as a form of popular political education.  Meisel\'s interests in politics and education have combined most directly in his third book, <i>Knowledge and Power:  The Parliamentary Representation of Universities in Britain and the Empire</i> (in press), which details the phenomenon of university seats in Parliament and in imperial legislatures.  Although all but overlooked, the representation of universities was a part of the British constitution for 350 years, and spread in various ways to North America, Australasia, the Mediterranean, and India as British educational and political models accompanied imperial expansion.<br /><br />Earlier in his career, Meisel also investigated political and cultural phenomena in Britain associated with fears of war -- a subject to which he plans to return.'

S'Dr. Mende has a longstanding interest in myocardial signaling mechanisms that control cardiac growth and function under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Signal transduction via G protein-coupled receptors is one of the most important mechanisms of signal transfer across the plasma membrane in virtually all cells, including heart cells. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) act as relay switches that are responsible for proper transduction of cell surface signals to specific ion channels and/or second messenger pathways inside the cell. G proteins are under the control of Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS proteins). We and others have shown that changes in the expression level, composition and/or function of G proteins and RGS proteins often lead to alterations in cell signaling with subsequent changes in cardiac function. <br /><br />The major focus in my laboratory over the past 10 years has been to better understand the molecular mechanisms that link derangement in G protein-mediated myocyte signaling to cardiac hypertrophy and failure. To that end, we have been utilizing a wide range of techniques from different disciplines, including gain- and loss-of-function approaches in vitro (primary cultures of cardiac myocytes) and in vivo (genetically modified mouse models), molecular biological approaches to examine gene expression and regulation, biochemical approaches to measure enzyme function and second messenger levels and physiological approaches to assess single myocyte and cardiac growth and contraction. Our long-term goal is to identify potential new targets and strategies for pharmacological or genetic therapies. <br /><br />We recently expanded our investigations from cardiac myocytes to fibroblasts, the other major cell type in the heart. Importantly, both cell types are always in close contact with each other and exert mutual regulatory control via direct cell-cell contact and paracrine factors. Myocyte-fibroblast cross-regulation and its importance in the development of cardiac disease are not well understood. We are currently developing experimental models to address these questions in more detail.'

S"The ideas of scaling and self-similarity are central organizing  principles in applied mathematics and condensed matter physics.  Famous examples are the central limit theorem in probability, the  Kolmogorov spectrum in fully developed turbulence, coarsening of  domains in the spinodal decomposition of alloys and polymer melts,  and the roughening of growing interfaces. Yet, these  apparently  simple`laws' can defy rigorous understanding, and are often  macroscopic manifestations of deeper microscopic mechanisms. My goal  is a rigorous understanding of `dynamic scaling laws' in a few  carefully chosen examples in fluid mechanics, materials science and  physical chemistry. The emphasis is on applied analysis-- to prove  theorems (motivated by experiments and numerics) that explain scaling  behavior and universality.<br /><br />My work in the past five years was focused on two projects: (a) the  long time behavior of free surface instabilities (for example, the  Rayleigh-Taylor instability observed at the launch of a rocket, or  in  the supernova in the Crab Nebula), (b) models of coalescence  (describing for instance the formation of smoke, dust and haze).  A  striking result has been the discovery of the fundamental utility of  classical methods in probability for the description of such scaling  dynamical systems. This has led to a basic framework that underlies a  class of apparently unrelated problems. Current work is focused on  rigorous models of turbulence in fluid  mechanics, models of domain coarsening in materials science, and  models of conformation changes in polymer chemistry."

S'My research has involved investigations of novel strategies to prevent device-related infections, particularly those due to intravascular catheters.  This has been pursued by my writing and carrying out study protocols for prospective, randomized multicentered investigations, writing and carrying out laboratory investigations for the in vitro study of novel technologies aimed at prevention of such infections, and in writing evidence-based guidelines regarding the management and prevention of such infections so the gains in research are realized by clinicians.<br /><br />I have also carried out research on the application of molecular fingerprinting to infection control and hospital epidemiology in an effort to better understand pathogenesis and epidemiology of hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections.<br /><br />My research has also involved understanding the epidemiology of multi-drug resistant pathogens in the hospital and community setting using case-control or cohort studies.<br /><br />Lastly, some of my research has involved applying epidemiologic tools to carry out outbreak investigations.'

S"Research projects in my marijuana-administration laboratory are focused on marijuana's expectancy effects and the drug's pharmacological and cue-elicited effects on a number of behavioral domains including risk taking, impulsivity, and high risk sexual decision-making; on affect and arousal; on craving, incentive salience, subjective and physiologic stimulation, and on reward sensitivity.  We also examine individual differences characterizing marijuana users most sensitive to its effects and most vulnerable to the development of cannabis use disorders.  These include genetic factors, cognitive mechanisms such as marijuana expectancies and use motives, and traits such as anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and impulsive disinhibition. The long-term objective of this program of research is to examine how knowledge gained from cannabis-administration laboratory studies can help develop innovative clinical intervention strategies for marijuana smokers.  This research is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and is reviewed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Brown University Institutional Review Board."

She is a gerontologist and epidemiologist whose research focuses on nursing home end-of-life care, hospice care, and long-term care utilization and quality. Dr. Miller\'s research includes an applied policy study funded by the JEHT Foundation and aimed at understanding how state policies and practices influence access to and quality of palliative care/hospice for persons receiving long-term care services, and a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded study to identify and disseminate nursing home/hospice "collaborative solutions." Her ongoing or recently completed research includes studies funded by the National Institute on Aging, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Alzheimer\'s Association that aim to understand how use of hospice care in nursing homes has changed over time, how key federal state policy may be associated with this use, how changes in state policies and practices may be associated with changes in use, and how hospice use is associated with resident and nursing home quality of care indicators.  A recently completed study, funded by the Retirement Research Foundation, examined how state policies may be associated with the implementation of culture change in U.S. nursing homes and how the implementation of culture change practices is associated with quality outcomes. The goal of Dr. Miller\'s research is to generate and disseminate knowledge to inform policy making and care provision; the ultimate goal is to improve access to and the quality of long-term care, particularly end-of-life care. Prior to receiving her PhD in 1997, Dr. Miller had an over 20-year career as an administrator, educator, and consultant in the field of health information management.'

I am also involved with research involving obstructive sleep apnea in obese indidviduals undergoing bariatric surgery.  In conjunction with Drs Katherine Sharkey and Ghada Bourjeily we are beginning projects evaluating obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women.  I am also involved with Dr. Michael Stein on research involving methadone users.  This NIH sponsored grant examines the impact of sleep loss on drug relapse. Subjects are radomized to either trazodone or placebo to see if improving sleep decreases relapse rate.'

S"Dr. Miranda is an associate professor (research) in the Department of Psychiatry & Human Behavior. He leads a research program that focuses on how biobehavioral mechanisms that confer liability for addiction influence treatment responsiveness.  Most of this work focuses on adolescents.  The overarching goal of this program is to translate findings from the human laboratory to improve treatment initiatives.  He joined the faculty at Brown University in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior and at the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies (CAAS) in 2004.  An innovative methodological strategy employed across much of his work involves the systematic pairing of experimentally-controlled human laboratory paradigms with ecological momentary assessment, whereby research participants use handheld electronic diaries to monitor their behavior as well as sensitivity to alcohol and other drugs in real time in their natural environment.  Through a career development award funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), he developed expertise in pharmacotherapy research.  At present, his research program is conducting two of the first federally-funded medication trials for adolescents with alcohol and drug problems.  He has received funding for this work from NIAAA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  A major outcome of these studies will be to learn whether medication-induced changes in craving or sensitivity to alcohol or cannabis lead to reductions in adolescent substance use.  Understanding adolescents' sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of these drugs and how medications affect this phenomenon will bridge an important translational gap between animal models and the clinical field.<br /><br />Dr. Miranda has served on several NIH scientific review committees and co-chaired the program committee for 2010 meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism, an organization with more than 1600 members from countries throughout the world.  He is a member of the teaching faculty at the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies and has mentored many pre- and postdoctoral trainees."

"Lifetimes" are organized both socially (for instance, in the United States, one is practically, legally, and morally required to be formally educated during much of one\'s first two decades of life, typically within specialized educational institutions), and psychologically (I am in some sense the same John Modell that my parents raised, and in some senses a different character).

The questions that most attract me now fall under two headings: human development, and the nature of disciplinary and public knowledge in the social and behavioral sciences. More specifically, I am working to understand progress in and through institutions of formal education as a historically-embedded past of children\'s lives; and to understand the failed synthesis of the social and behavioral sciences that seemed so promising in the United States in the two decades that followed World War II.'

He has sat on numerous Editorial Boards and Boards of Directors in the addictions field.  Dr. Monti's expertise lies in understanding the bio-behavioral mechanisms involved in both pharmacotherapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for substance abuse disorders, and he has been a leader toward increasing the integration of psychosocial and biomedical models of substance abuse and treatment research. Dr. Monti is presently PI on two major research grants: a basic mechanisms research program focused on understanding how a pharmacological agent affects craving for alcohol in the natural environment; and a trauma unit assessment and brief intervention project that incorporates significant others into the treatment. He has been a pioneer on biobehavioral mechanisms that cut across alcohol and nicotine use and abuse and on the use of cue reactivity as an endophenotype.  His contributions are reflected in nearly 200 manuscripts of both innovative assessment and translational treatment approaches in these areas, as well as in five books.  His Treating Alcohol Dependence Book, currently undergoing its third revision, has been a mainstay of treatment both in this country and abroad, and his newsletter, The Brown University Digest of Addiction Theory and Application (DATA), serves to bridge empirical work in addictions (such as that conducted in his lab) with the treatment community."

S"Dr. Mor has been Principal Investigator of nearly 30 NIH funded grants focusing on the organizational and health care delivery system factors associated with variation in use of health services and the outcomes frail and chronically ill persons experience. He has had multiple grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Commonwealth Fund, Pew Memorial Trust, the Retirement Research Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, as well as contracts from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation to evaluate the impact of programs and policies in aging and long term care including Medicare funding of hospice, the costs and benefits of day hospital treatment of cancer, patient outcomes in nursing homes, the impact of short term case management for cancer patients, several studies documenting age discrimination in cancer treatment and use of home care services, and a national study of residential care facilities. Over the past 30 years Dr. Mor's research has frequently integrated quantitative and qualitative data, particularly in program evaluations examining the approaches communities, organizations, and specific providers use to adjust to health policy changes, such as financing and reimbursement, or to the emergence of integrated delivery systems.<br /><br />Dr. Mor was one of the authors of the Congressionally mandated Minimum Data Set (MDS) for Nursing Home Resident Assessment and evaluated its implementation. Dr. Mor has conducted extensive research on the reliability and validity of the MDS data as used in the field and has pioneered the use of these data to characterize nursing home residents' physical, cognitive, and psycho-social functioning, all of which have been used in resident and facility level analyses of the quality of nursing home care in US and international populations. Dr. Mor directed the Brown University component of a CMS contract to develop and validate risk adjusted quality indicators for nursing homes that are now being used for public reporting of nursing home quality throughout the country.<br /><br />He recently completed the second 5 years of a MERIT award from NIA for his research on nursing home organizational factors related to facility quality and residents' outcomes and has subsequently received multiple NIA grants to examine the policy and organizational determinants of hospitalization of nursing home residents and other indicators of the quality of care provided.  Dr. Mor was the recipient of a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Investigator award to examine the influence of managed care and integrated delivery systems on the strategic decisions of nursing homes and their quality consequences for residents. Presently, he is examining the effect of state policies and market factors on the quality of care provided nursing home residents, including rehospitalization, merging primary and secondary data from all nursing facilities in the United States. Dr. Mor is seeking to determine whether quality is worse in the states with consistently poor and disjointed long term care policies.<br /><br />Dr. Mor was a member of the Secretary of HHS's National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the Institute of Medicine Committee on Long Term Care Quality. He is a member of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Health Services Research for the Department of Veteran Affairs. He was Chair of the Long Term Care Interest group of AcademyHealth, seeking to expand that organization's interest in and fostering of research on long term care and is currently Program Chair for the Annual Research Meeting of AcademyHealth in Washington, DC in 2008.  He has published over 300 peer reviewed articles and numerous books and book chapters on nursing home quality, hospice, physical functioning, long term care, and cancer treatment patterns among the elderly as well as the organization of AIDS health services. Dr. Mor has published widely on the measurement of quality of life and physical functioning in various chronically ill populations using both previously standardized as well as novel measures of functioning. He has published models pertaining to the measurement of quality in long term care facilities and lectures widely on this topic. He is a fellow of the American Gerontological Society and is on the editorial board of Health Services Research."

This program involves 3 research and administration cores and 4 separate projects all of which seek to better understand the impact of changing state Medicaid policies on long term care providers and the patients that they serve. Collaborating with colleagues from Dartmouth, Dr. Mor and his Brown colleagues have documented large regional variation in hospitalization rates, including end of life transitions and the use of hospice and palliative care.  Additionally, this research has documented substantial disparities in the care and outcomes white and minority nursing home residents receive, largely attributable to the fact that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to reside in sub-standard facilities.<br /><br /><br />Dr. Mor was a member of the Secretary of HHS\'s National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the recently completed Institute of Medicine Committee on Long Term Care Quality. He is on the Board of AcademyHealth, the premier health services research association in the US and chairs the Independent Quality Committee for hcr-Manorcare, a US nursing home group.  He has published over 300 peer reviewed articles and numerous books and book chapters on hospice, physical functioning, long term care and cancer treatment patterns among the elderly as well as the organization of AIDS health services. He is on several editorial boards including Health Services Research. In 2011 Dr. Mor was given the Distinguished Investigator Award From AcademyHealth, the premier health services research organization in the country.'

S'I am interested in how the speech that infants and young children hear affects early language acquisition. My current research focuses on complementary questions of the nature of such speech, particularly with regard to properties that may cue aspects of language structure, and the nature of early perceptual capacities for extracting and representing the structural information that is cued. This work bears on the theoretical characterization of the initial state with regard to language learning: To the extent that input speech is rich in cues to structure that infants can represent appropriately, the need for imputing abstract grammatical knowledge to infants (as many recent theories have done) will be reduced. <br /><br />Recent work in my laboratory on the properties of speech to infants shows that repeated tokens of words tend to be less phonetically variable (though more prosodically variable) in speech to infants than in speech to adults. This may aid infants in recognizing different tokens as exemplars of the same word and may assist in the establishment of the mental lexicon. Different grammatical categories of words possess varying constellations of acoustic, phonetic, and phonological properties; hence, these properties of speech may provide a basis for infants to begin to assign words to appropriate categories. <br /><br />For her doctoral dissertation at Brown, Rushen Shi (now assistant professor at the University of British Columbia) showed that sets of cues in typologically distinctive languages are sufficient to allow untutored learners to categorize lexical and grammatical words accurately. At present, Heather Bortfeld, a National Research Service Award (NRSA) post-doctoral fellow, is investigating the prosodic and phonological correlates of the given/new distinction in English and Spanish infant-directed speech, and Leher Singh, a first-year graduate student, is analyzing the differences between "happy talk" and "baby talk" as the initial step toward studying whether infants\' listening preferences are determined by speech affect or register. As a follow-up to her dissertation, Rushen Shi has been studying whether very young infants can categorically discriminate sets of lexical and grammatical words - categories that appear to be based on correlated acoustic/phonological properties.  Shi, Werker, & Morgan (in submission) show that both 6-month-olds and 3-day-olds(!) succeed in this discrimination. Three-day-olds recover from habituation symmetrically, but 6-month-olds have already learned that lexical words are more interesting (or perhaps gramatical words aren\'t worth conciously attending to), so that they display asymmetric recovery from habituation. <br /><br />Our work on infant speech perception focuses on the problems of how infants solve the word-segmentation problem and the nature of early lexical representations. Although words must initially be no more evident to an infant than they are to an adult listening to a foreign language, well before the end of the first year infants are capable of recognizing at least some words in fluent speech. Our studies show that infants exposed to English begin between 6 and 9 months to deploy a bias for the strong-weak pattern that predominates in the language in grouping syllables and segmenting words. Other studies show that between these two ages infants also begin to utilize language-specific knowledge of phonotactics (concerning permissible sequences of sounds and their relative likelihoods) as an additional means of identifying word boundaries. Ongoing research is examining in detail the development of infants\' recognition of familiar words in fluent speech. Some of this research was described in an article in the Brown Alumni Monthly.'

S"Beginning academic life as a linguist with interests in language processing and computation, I switched over in graduate school to become a (developmental) psychologist. In my youth, claims about innate bases and properties of language predominated. I am not altogether unsympathetic with that viewpoint, but it has always seemed to me that the most powerful argument for language preprogramming must be made by considering the strongest possible empirically supportable assumptions about richness of language input and the power of learners' perceptual, representational, and analytic capacities, and then determining specific aspects of language where these fall short. I have devoted my career to exploring the nature of language input (the auditory and, more recently, visual experiences of infants) and the nature of infants' language processing abilities. I have focused particularly on infants' spoken word recognition &#150; a set of complex perceptual and computational skills fundamental for language comprehension and acquisition, involving arguably the most central unit of language structure."

S"There are four interdisciplinary and collaborative projects in the lab.<br /><ol><li>In collaboration with Dean Clyde Briant (Eng) and funded by the Veterans Adminstration, we are investigating ways to improve the performance of percutaneous medical devices that penetrate the skin.  There are over a million percutaneous devices (indwelling catheters, dialysis ports, etc.) implanted each year, and the long-term use of these devices is severely limited due to problems of inflammation and infection because the skin does not form an adequate seal around the device.  This is especially problematic for a new titanium osseo-integration device that is being tested for the repair of amputations. The device is anchored in the bone and extends out through the skin where a prosthetic limb is attached.  To optimize the skin seal around this device, we are investigating the influence of surface chemistry, surface topography and alloy composition on the adhesion and proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.  We are also investigating the mechanics of the skin/percutaneous device interface. </li><br /><li>In collaboration with Profs. Robert Hurt (Eng), Agnes Kane (Pathobiology), and Gregory Crawford (Eng) and funded by an NSF Nanotechnology Interdisciplinary Research Team grant, we are developing a device to screen for potential toxic effects of nano-materials on target organs such as the lung and skin.  Nanotechnology holds great promise for advancements in many fields including medicine, electronics and materials science.  However, the health effects of these new materials is largely unknown, and humans may come into contact with nano-materials through deliberate or accidental inhalation or contact with the skin. To investigate potential toxic effects, we are developing a high throughput chip containing microarrays of nanomaterials (single wall/multiwall carbon nanotubes, nanohorns, gold nanoparticles and gold/titanium nanoparticles).  The biochemical responses of skin cells and macrophages grown on these chips are being measured to determine the cellular responses to these new materials with the goal of determining those nanoscale features that lead to minimal toxicity and optimal biocompatibility.</li><br /><li>In collaboration with Drs. Martin Yarmush and Mehmet Toner (Harvard Medical School) and funded by an NIH Bioengineering Research Partnership grant, we are developing a living cell array containing genetically modified cells that have been engineered to induce the expression of green fluorescent protein in response to a large panel of well-known inflammatory mediators. Unlike the profiling of gene expression using conventional genomics tools that require the killing of cells and the extraction of RNA, the living cell array reports the kinetics and duration of gene expression in real-time by quantifying the fluorescence of living cells.  This data has generated new insight into the signal transduction of inflammatory mediators.  As the panel of reporter genes and reporter cell lines is expanded to develop a massively parallel high throughput system for the simultaneous monitoring of the expression of hundreds of genes, the device will generate new algorithms for understanding how a cell perceives and integrates the conflicting signals from a complex and sometimes pathological milieu.</li><br /><li>As part of Brown's NSF sponsored Materials Research Science and Engineering Center on Micro- and Nano-Mechanics of Materials, we are investigating the fundamental processes of cell to cell and cell to material adhesion.  We have developed a novel and highly effective method to form aggregates of cells.  A hydrogel such as agarose that is non-adhesive for cells is micro-molded to have small wells.  A suspension of single cells is added and the cells settle into these wells and instead of binding to the surface of the hydrogel, the cells contact one another and form small tight aggregates of cells.  This is almost the exact opposite of the conventional culture of cells on Petri dishes where the cells bind and spread on the plastic surface of the dish.  Using this method we are examining the dynamics of cell to cell adhesion as well as the fundamental processes governing the self assembly of cells into functional micro-tissues. </li></ol>"

S'Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and intellectual disability are common and cause profound morbidity in populations worldwide.  The associated costs to society are high and that to families are immeasurable.  Intellectual disability (ID, formerly mental retardation), the most common developmental disability, occurs in 2% of people, and ranks first in the US as a cause of lifelong disability (National Center for Health Statistics U.S., 1996).  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) occur in approximately 1 in 200 children.  ID occurs in up to 50% of children with ASD and epilepsy occurs in approximately 25% of children affected by ASD.<br /><br />     The Morrow lab investigates the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying disorders of cognitive development.  The long-term aim of this research is to establish a basic foundation for improved genetic diagnoses and treatment interventions designed to enhance cognitive and functional gains for patients.  Because these disorders are highly genetic and in order to identify core molecular mechanisms, genome-wide "forward genetic" strategies to identify genetic mutations have been a principal focus.  In complement to this, molecular and neurodevelopmental studies of identified pathways are underway.<br /><br />     Research in the Morrow lab thereby follows two synergistic approaches: 1) human genetic studies in patient and control samples; 2) molecular neurodevelopment studies of identified pathways.  In the first approach, the lab has a strong interest in rare genetic variation, including both genomic copy number and sequence changes.  Our own data and that from the field as a whole have demonstrated a large and increasing number of heterogeneous loci in developmental disorders.  Through extensive regional and international collaboration, we are establishing large datasets of genome-wide microarray data which are studied using new bioinformatic strategies.  In molecular studies, we are focusing on neurodevelopmental mechanisms whereby these heterogeneous genes and loci appear to converge, which includes mechanisms involved in synaptic maturation.  We are developing experimental models for studying disease genes and mutations in this process.  In both our genetic and mechanistic studies, we are also implementing next generation sequencing technologies, as these new methods now provide a power in genomic analysis which has been previously unattainable.  Whereby several genetic loci under study have also been implicated in schizophrenia (another neuropsychiatric disorder with developmental and cognitive features), the lab is working through collaboration to understand the role that pathways of interest may play in this condition as well.<br /><br />     Research in the Morrow lab bridges campus and medical school efforts at Brown.  The Morrow lab is located at the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at 70 Ship Street.  The Lab partners with the Developmental Disorders Genetics Research Program (DDGRP) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior which occupies patient-oriented research space at Bradley Hospital for Children in East Providence.  Significant efforts are underway to establish a multi-site collaborative for study of genetics of developmental disorders across the lifespan through the DDGRP and other centers at Brown University Medical School and in Rhode Island.'

S'Project LINK (R21/R33 MH80591; Morrow, Principal Investigator) is an NIH Microbicide Innovation Program (MIP) award, an award mechanism designed to accelerate and advance innovation in the development of anti-HIV microbicides. The project is designed to provide proof-of-concept that vaginal microbicide users can feel and discriminate variations in product formulations, and that these perceptions impact the user\'s willingness to use the product. The ultimate goal is to develop a framework for developing vaginal gels that meet specific preclinical criteria for acceptability dimensions, thus conserving resources (by removing unacceptable products from the pipeline early) and accelerating acceptable products through the development pipeline and increasing the likelihood of greater adherence during clinical trials.<br /><br />Project MAPLE (U19 AI077289 (Buckheit, PI): Long Acting Acceptable Microbicides: Novel Delivery, Activity & Pharmacodynamics, Project 3) is one of three studies within the larger U19 mechanism. It\'s purpose is to explore the biophysical and biomechanical variables that impact product acceptability with respect to long-acting vaginal gels (LAGs) and intravaginal rings (IVRs). The goal is to develop acceptable LAGs and IVRs for use as anti-HIV microbicides.<br /><br />AID.1233-14-07567(Coffey, PI)is a USAID-funded study exploring the "Feasibility and Acceptability of SILCS Diaphragm as a Microbicide Delivery System." The study Aim is to test the deployment characteristics, as well as feasibility and acceptability of, a delivery system combining a microbicide gel and the SILCS diaphragm to effectively deliver a vaginal gel formulated microbicide. <br /><br />The Phoenix Project (R01 MH 064455; Morrow, Principal Investigator) was a NIMH-funded project with the primary goal of designing and evaluating measures of factors hypothesized to be related to vaginal microbicide acceptability. Several scales were identified and psychometrically validated. They include a "Willingness to Use Microbicides" scale, a "Relationship Quality " measure, a "Microbicide Confidence" Scale, a scale measuring the "Importance of Microbicide Characteristics," and a cognitive/behavioral Risk Index. Analyses support Dr. Morrow\'s conceptualization of microbicide acceptability as a multi-factorial construct highly impacted by person-, product-, and context-related factors.<br /><br />Dr. Morrow served as the acceptability studies chair in both the HIV Prevention Network (HIVNET) and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN). Across four Phase-1 clinical safety trials of candidate vaginal microbicides (HPTN 009, HPTN 020, HPTN 050, HPTN 049) she and her teams have confirmed the overall acceptability of gel-formulated microbicides, and have explored factors hypothesized to be related to microbicide acceptability. These include the relationship context, the need or desire for a microbicide that not only prevents or reduces the likelihood of HIV infection, but also provides protection from other STDs and pregnancy, the need or desire to use a microbicide "covertly," such that the partner is unaware of its use, and the product\'s impact on sexual pleasure.<br /><br />As Principal Investigator of Project START, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded HIV/STD behavioral prevention intervention development and evaluation project designed for young men leaving the incarcerated setting, she and her colleagues successfully conducted formative qualitative and quantitative studies culminating in the development of two intervention strategies. Primary outcome data from a randomized trial showed that the enhanced intervention (which focused on both HIV/STD prevention and transitional needs as men re-entered their communities) resulted in greater proportions of safer sex behavior than the standard intervention (a single-session HIV/STD prevention session). The intervention has completed development as a CDC REP study and currently enjoyed its status as a CDC DEBI (Diffusion of Effective Behavioral INterventions) program.'

S"My primary research interests focus on the relationship between resource exploitation and lifetime fitness. Our laboratory concentrates on the crab spider Misumena vatia, a sit-and-wait predator on flowers, for this work. The critical activity of adult female M. vatia is finding food and that of the adult males is finding females. Since the two activities require considerable time and search, it is appropriate to consider them both as examples of foraging. We have evaluated the consequences of foraging success on key life history variables throughout M. vatia's life cycle. To understand how M. vatia's attributes and limitations affect them in this quest, we have recently concentrated on the role played by cognitive factors in determining success in foraging at different stages of the life cycle. Misumena vatia is one of the most dimorphic of free-living land animals, and these studies simultaneously provide insight into the forces driving this striking condition and the degree to which they result from mutualistic and antagonistic selective pressures on the two sexes.<br /><br />A second interest focuses on four-trophic-level systems and the role that indirect effects may play in structuring communities. For instance, what effect does the first trophic level, as channeled through the second and third levels, have upon the fourth level? Chemical differences between food plants may affect their quality to herbivores, but what effect may this result play in the success of parasitoids, and on the success of their own parasitoids, the hyperparasitoids? These questions have considerable importance for the success of biological control, yet the parasitoid-hyperparasitoid relationship, a potentially key aspect of parasitoid success, is but poorly studied. Our system permits realistic field experimentation of these two links.<br /><br />Foraging and life history theory<br /><br />Adult female<br /><br />Our laboratory focuses on relating foraging theory to life history in the context of their contributions to lifetime fitness. We concentrate this work on the crab spider Misumena vatia, a sit-and-wait predator on flowers. We have worked on foraging acts that convey especially large fitness payoffs, as measured by numbers of offspring recruited into the next generation. Probably the most important is patch choice by adult females, who may increase in mass up to ten-fold over two to three weeks if they find an ideal hunting site. Variation in success at this time is great, however, both because of difficulties in locating an ideal hunting site and because some individuals eschew high-quality sites if presented with them. To solve this apparent paradox, we are currently studying the role of early experience, most likely encoded as learning, in affecting young individuals in their choice of hunting sites. We are particularly interested in whether this behavior can be passed over molting episodes to subsequent instars, especially adults. Where feasible, we work with groups of known sibs, so that we can simultaneously assess possible genetic aspects of variation in patch choice.<br /><br />Sexual selection<br /><br />A second focus explores the roles of sexual selection and natural selection to male and female fitness in Misumena. Males are small, sometimes no more than 1/100th the mass of gravid adult females, largely a consequence of going through fewer molt cycles than the females. These populations are female-biased, ranging from about 1.4 females per male at hatching to 2.5 to 5.0 females per male as adults. Densities of males are low, and unmated adult females do not appear to advertise their presence to the males, as do other spiders thus far studied in this context.<br /><br />Adult male<br /><br />Male mortality of most animals including spiders is generally thought to be high when they search for females, resulting in rapidly diminishing numbers. However, male numbers of Misumena do not decline significantly until late in the summer, after almost all females have mated. The small size and extreme agility of the males likely minimize their vulnerability at this time. Although male food needs are not critical at this time, males select the same flowers that females prefer. This preference could thus position males with females more often than predicted by chance.<br /><br />A four-trophic-level system<br /><br />We have also begun to study a four-trophic-level system involving a pyralid moth whose larvae feed on ferns. These larvae feed primarily on two abundant species, sensitive and marsh ferns, and on at least three other species of ferns where available, for a total of five ferns from three families. This spread suggests an unusual ability to process a wide range of defensive chemicals probably responsible for minimizing attacks from most herbivores. Densities of moth larvae reach extremely high levels in large colonies consisting of thousands of individuals. Most such sites are located in low-lying areas of old fields that support luxuriant fern growths. The moths are heavily parasitized by a braconid wasp, which in turn is hyperparasitized by ichneumonid and chalcidoid wasps. Investigations cyrrently underway will establish the success of the moths on different fern species and the consequences of this success upon the corresponding success of their parasitoids and hyperparasitoids. The system is well suited for studies of the role of both bottom-up and top-down forces on interactions amoung these different trophic levels. Multitrophic-level studies usually do not incorporate hyperparasitoids in spite of their likely importance in mediating the success of parasitoids."

S'I am a behavioral ecologist and am especially interested in foraging behavior and sexual selection and how they relate to life history strategies that affect lifetime fitness.  Recently I have concentrated this work on cognitive aspects that address the roles of innate and learned traits, and how their contributions change over a lifetime.  I have also commenced research on a four-trophic-level system.  I have published two books, and a third, which synthesizes most of my career research work, is due to appear in Fall 2006 or Winter 2007.  I commenced my career at the University of Maryland and came to Brown in 1979 as the Hermon Carey Bumpus Professor of Biology, officially retiring in 2005, but remaining active in my own reearch field, mentoring undergraduate research, and offering a reduced load of courses.

S'Chronic bacterial infection by H. pylori is common and is strongly associated epidemiologically with the development of gastric (stomach) cancer. H. pylori causes a chronic inflammatory state in the stomach of all infected individuals, yet only a small proportion of infected individuals develop cancer. By exploring bacterial- and host-related factors that determine clinical outcome following infection, we aim to understand the mechanisms contributing to cancer following H. pylori infection. Our work has demonstrated that H. pylori perturbs the cell cycle of gastric epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis and compensatory epithelial hyperproliferation. Currently we are using cell culture and animal models to investigate specifically how H. pylori decreases gastric epithelial cell expression of p27, an important cell cycle regulatory and tumor suppressor protein. We also utilize p27-deficient mice as a mouse model for gastric cancer induced by H. pylori. We translate our findings between the basic sciences and clinical conditions associated with H. pylori infection. By investigating the pathogenesis of H. pylori we aim to also shed light upon other chronic inflammatory conditions associated with increased cancer risk.'

He has chosen topics and approaches that combine the methods of both disciplines. This is true for the books and essays he has published about Rubens and Van Dyck (<i>Rubens: The Artist as Collector</i>, 1989; "The Quality of Grace in the Art of Anthony van Dyck," 1991), as well as for articles on broader topics ("Measures of Authenticity: The Detection of Copies in the Early Literature on Connoisseurship", 1989). His edition of Edward Norgate\'s <i>Miniatura or the Art of Limning</i> (1997), synthesized history of artistic technique, social history, history of art theory, and textual criticism to set the treatise in its historical context and make the text accessible. His current research further develops the recognition that "the past is a foreign country."

S'I work in the area of machine and natural intelligence, following the statistical approach pioneered by Ulf Grenander, which we call "Pattern Theory". In this approach, thinking is modeled as statistical inference rather than logic and learning results from the accumulation of massive data from interactions with the world. My work concentrates on visual perception which seems to be more approachable than high-level thinking, more complex than auditory and tactile perception yet has been solved by three distinct classes of animals (cephalopods, birds and mammals) so it can\'t be that hard! The aspect of this research with which I have been most involved is the construction of probability models for the variables of vision: direct models of the raw images, the shapes of objects, the texture of their surfaces etc. A second question is how to sample and estimate with these models, e.g. compute conditional means and modes. Many approaches involve computing with one or more samples from the distribution which evolve deterministically or stochastically, smoothly or with jumps. Sampling from the distribution can be viewed as feedback, i.e. prior knowledge of high level structures guides the reconstruction of an image. A third set of questions concerns how such statistical estimation may be performed in cortex, in neural nets with feedback. A major open question here is whether the information being handled by neurons is contained only in their firing rates or in the precise timing and synchrony of their spikes in the full network. Another is how cortex handles ambiguity, the need for maintaining multiple hypotheses while waiting for more data.'

In 1969 he received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute. His early projects at the Center include: high power microwave tube design, a super-conductive computer memory system, the design of high density associative memory arrays, the application of transform coding to image data compression and the development of an automatic inspection system for lamp filaments. From 1977 until 1982 he was Manager, Visual Information Processing Program. In this capacity he led a number of extensive efforts in the application of machine vision techniques to automatic visual inspection for quality control. In the 1980's Dr. Mundy formed a group to apply Image Understanding algorithms to aerial reconnaissance. He developed a system for aircraft recognition based on a sparse feature, called the vertex-pair, which achieved 98% recognition accuracy in a test on realistic airfield scenes. In the early 1990's, he was co-developer of a new approach to object representation and recognition based on geometric invariance. Over the last five years, he has participated in the RADIUS project, providing algorithms to the RADIUS Testbed System (RTS) which make use of the context provided by a 3D site model. These algorithms include change detection based on various levels of image segmentation and specific object structure matching.<br /><br />Dr. Mundy's professional activities involve active participation in the areas of pattern recognition and robotics. He was co-chairman of the workshop on industrial applications of machine vision which resulted in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) in 1982. He is currently on the editorial board of the International Journal on Computer Vision. He also serves on the NSF advisory board for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (IRIS). In 1988 he was named a Coolidge Fellow, the highest technical award in GE. He completed a year sabbatical as a visiting fellow at Oxford University during 1988-89. In 1993 Dr. Mundy was co-recipient of the Marr Prize, the leading prize in the field of Computer Vision. He is chairman of DARPA's Image Understanding Environment (IUE) Committee, which has specified and is supervising the development of the IUE.

S'Our focus has been on Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), an interstitial collagenase, highly expressed by neutrophils (PMNs), and recently described in fibroblasts.  We have previously demonstrated the sustained neutrophil chemotaxis and novel hepatic gene expression of MMP-8 during liver injury and repair, and described active MMP-8 as the collagenase associated with matrix resorption.  Moreover, our neutrophil depletion studies revealed a lack of collagenase activity despite increased gene expression. The primary goal of this research is to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which MMP-8 modulates hepatic fibrosis.  The translational aspiration is to develop innovative therapies to improve recovery from fibrosis. <br />This work is significant given that chronic cholestatic liver disease is a common primary or secondary injury that predisposes children to the development of end-stage liver disease.  Moreover, biliary obstruction and the majority of liver injuries share common inflammatory cascades with cumulative hepatic fibrogenesis that predispose to carcinogenesis and cirrhosis.  The mechanisms of hepatic stellate cell activation that lead to type I collagen deposition are well described compared to our poor understanding of recovery from cholestasis during liver repair; a process many consider a more important investigation with organ preservation and lifesaving potential.  Our studies have broad and important clinical implications for the treatment of cholestatic or chronic liver injury as seen in infants with biliary atresia, intestinal failure from short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition-induced injury where there is no biologic assurance of adequate hepatic repair despite surgical decompression.'

S'Murray\'s research stresses that debates about the political and aesthetic functions of black literature can be productive in rewriting extant literary and cultural histories. Along these lines, his first book, Our Living Manhood: Literature, Black Power, and Masculine Ideology, argues that scholars have not adequately examined the gendered nationalisms that shaped the Black Power movement. For some time now commentators have criticized the movement for its sexism and its broader preoccupation with refashioning black masculinity. Yet few have remarked the challenge to this masculinist current voiced in the work of authors such as James Alan McPherson, James Baldwin, John Edgar Wideman, Clarence Major, Hal Bennett, and John Oliver Killens. In fiction and essays written during the heyday of Black Power activism, these writers tracked the political incoherence, fragmentation, and anxiety that beset nationalisms tethered to identity politics. Moreover, their critical reservations remind us that even key purveyors of the era\'s gender economies were at times quite ambivalent about the privileging of masculinity. The era\'s masculine focus thus bred contradictions for those within the movement and criticisms from those outside it. To reassess these cleavages, he analyzes the ways in which notions of masculinity were interwoven with nationalist ideologies regarding revolutionary violence, charismatic leadership, radical rhetoric, and black sexuality. Striving to forge a more nuanced account of how masculinist discourse contributed to the movement\'s overall agenda, he frames masculinity as both a linchpin of the Black Power movement\'s seductive politics and a focal point of dissent by black male authors. In doing so, he also makes the case that the gender divides of the Black Power era continue to have a powerful influence on contemporary African American culture.<br /><br />Revisionist cultural history figures prominently in his most recent book project as well. Blackness Undone: African American Culture and the End of Identity rethinks the sense of impending calamity that has pervaded black literary and cultural studies over the past two decades.  Cornel West articulates one version of this current when he describes the present as a period of  "postmodern crisis." He laments the "decline of [black] popular mobilization, and the decline of political participation and the decomposition more and more of the institutions of old civil society . . ." Voicing a related concern, Spillers observes that the locus of black communal life, the segregated enclave, has itself been so radically changed by deindustrialization, desegregation, and the plight of the black underclass that intellectuals must reconsider their understanding of community as an "object of knowledge."   These remarks distill many of the anxieties generated by rapid material changes in black life during the post-segregation era.  And while few question the legitimacy of such trepidation, recent work by Madhu Dubey and Kenneth Warren demonstrates that the same heralding of crisis also underwrites nostalgic calls for a return to the traditional cultural practices that defined black life during segregation. However, despite the acuity of the latter critiques, they provide little purchase on African American literature that stages the undoing of communal belonging as not only the end of something but as a potentially generative occasion. In order to expand and refine our understanding of these issues, this project proposes that the current period of crisis has not only produced nostalgia for the traditions of the past but has also ushered in a range of fiction, creative non-fiction, and drama that imagines innovative paradigms for reassessing black communal belonging.'

S"I am interested in the composition of <b>planetary surfaces</b> and the surface processes that modify them. A key interest recently has been Mars where I and my students and colleagues have developed a new paradigm for the evolution of Mars. Based on new European and NASA spacecraft data, we show that during the earliest period of Mars, prior to 3.8 billion years ago, abundant phyllosilicate formation occurred. This implies that clement environments existed (temperature, pH) that would have been supportive of habitable environments. Subsequently Mars became colder and drier leading to an era of sulfate formation which then transitioned to a very dry era with only minor alteration minerals formed. <br /><br />My <b>environmental science program</b> is focused on Land Use-Land Cover Change (LULCC) research.  This is an interdisciplinary field seeking to understand the intersection of human activity and natural processes in the transformations occurring on the Earth's surface.  Understanding these questions requires contributions from economics, demography, sociology, earth science, and ecology and I've been developing the contacts necessary to push the research agenda forward. This will clearly benefit from the Environmental Change Initiative as well as the MBL-Brown program."

S'Glittering Machines: <br />A Modular, Interactive, Kinetic, Sonic, and Illuminating Sculptural Series<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />Pygmalion and Automata<br /><br />Sculptors have always sought to breathe life into inanimate forms. The legendary figure of Pygmalion, the Cypriot sculptor who fell in love with an ivory statue he had carved, exemplifies this drive. Pygmalion and his statue not only married but also reproduced, further blurring the distinction between the animate and inanimate realms, and also commencing a perverse evolutionary chain of production and reproduction.<br /><br />Throughout history, one can follow this chain in the form of automata, which are mechanisms that mimic the natural appearance and movements of humans and animals. Early examples include Hero of Alexander, who engineered a completely mechanical theatrical play in the first century AD, to various mechanical servants and concubines found in Egyptian tombs, which supposedly served their masters in the next world. The 18th Century was the Golden Age of mechanical automata, perhaps best exemplified by Jacques Vaucanson\'s much acclaimed mechanical Duck, from 1709, that not only quacked, ate, and drank, but produced excretions as well. The desire for this type of mimicry &#150; of both animals and humans &#150; is very much alive today in the field of robotics. <br /><br />Cybernetic Sculpture<br /><br />A split in this evolution occurred in the 1950s-60s, however, with the introduction of cybernetics and by extension, cybernetic sculpture. In brief, cybernetic sculptors were less interested in mimicking the appearance and movements of living organisms than they were in investigating and borrowing from various biological systems (i.e., communicational, behavioral, and environmental) to create dynamic, interactive works of art. Jack Burnham, one the principle theorists of this art, defined a cybernetic sculpture as one that simply "processes information from its environment and uses this information to control physical events." (Burnam, Jack. Beyond Modern Sculpture. George Braziller, 1967.)<br /><br />Due to a number of economic, technological, and sociological factors, the development and creation of cybernetic sculpture waned throughout the last quarter of the 20th Century despite its initial promise.  At present, however, I believe we are on the cusp of the re-emergence of this form of interactive and dynamic art making. There are a number of reasons for this resurgence, such as the availability of inexpensive personal computers and micro-controllers, the development of high order (i.e., simpler) computer programming languages, and the increasing accessibility of CAD/CAM systems, such as laser cutters, rapid prototypers, and CNC routers. Above and beyond these factors, however, is one that I believe is the most significant and the least articulated: the desire to move away from the screen. <br /><br />The graphic user interfaces that allow us to interact with our computers and other electronic devices, i.e., cell phones, cable TVs, PDAs, e-readers, GPS systems, gaming devices, etc., are beginning to feel too narrow, too constricting, too separating, too disembodied. <br /><br />Physical Computing<br /><br />Artists and designers are just beginning to rethink our relationship with the digital world via the material world and our own bodies. Sometimes called physical computing, or embedded computing, there is now a growing sense that our customary input devices, i.e., keyboards and mice, and our customary output devices, i.e., screens and dead-tree media, are destined for the trash heap of history. <br /><br />What will replace them is a very open and expansive question, and a question that I believe sculptors in particular can contribute to answering in meaningful ways. Sculpture has always been about materials, spaces, and our bodies, and as mentioned above, sculpture has also often been about blurring the distinctions between the animate and inanimate realms.  <br /><br />To this end, I have been developing a multi-faceted sculptural project titled, Glittering Machines.<br /><br />GOALS & ACTIVITIES<br /><br />This project involves researching and developing a number of components that are then integrated into a series of modular, interactive, kinetic, sonic, and illuminating sculptures.<br /><br />The modular design of these sculptures permits different combinations of visual and sonic effects, and also makes the components scalable for different exhibition venues, i.e., from large-scale outdoor public artworks to more intimately scaled gallery works.<br />&#9;&#9;<br />The interactive aspect of these sculptures consists of various sensors (ultrasonic, infrared), motors (geared and stepped), microprocessors (Arduino and Freeduino), and the computer coding (Processing) necessary to program the system to respond to various stimuli in the environment. <br /><br />The kinetic components of these sculptures include mechanical designs, i.e., gear trains, slider cranks, and cam systems. All of the mechanical pieces are designed using basic engineering software (Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, Cinema 4D), fabricated from a variety of metals (steel and aluminum) and plastics (extruded acrylic and delrin).<br />&#9;&#9;<br />The sonic aspect of these sculptures includes various percussive components, i.e., bells, cymbals, ratchets, and drums, working synchronously with the aforementioned kinetic systems. These components are also designed using basic engineering software and fabricated from a variety of metals and plastics.<br />&#9;&#9;<br />The illuminating components of these sculptures include high-powered light emitting diodes (LEDs), fiber optic cabling, heat dissipation systems, and custom designed lenses. The illumination system is programmable in parallel with the interactive system. <br />&#9;&#9;<br />Taken together, all of the systems are integrated into a series of sculptures that behave in different ways depending upon the proximity and behavior of the viewing subject(s). Taking cues from various bioluminescent animals and insects, these behaviors range from attraction to repulsion, camouflage to revelation, predictability to spontaneity.'

This study will also include a sample of adolescents with asthma.  Results will demonstrate whether the immune response to stress is similar in people who have different immune-mediated diseases or whether the immunological characteristics of the disease play a role in how stress influences the immune system.<br /><br />Other active areas of interest include evaluating the quality of life, family functioning, and psychosocial functioning of children and adolescents with a variety of illnesses (e.g., diabetes, functional pain syndromes) who have been referred for treatment in the Hasbro Children&#8217;s Partial Hospital Program, a multidisciplinary day treatment program with a focus on family systems-based interventions.  The goal of this research is to show that children and adolescents with a variety of illnesses can benefit from a common family-based treatment.'

A general objective is to provide quantitative  relations between the measurable (and hopefully controllable) features of the materials' micro-scale structure and its macroscopic mechanical behavior. Ongoing research projects involve studies of ductile fracture and ductile-brittle transitions; crack growth in heterogeneous microstructures with particular emphasis on the role of interfaces; nonlocal and discrete dislocation plasticity; fatigue crack growth; and fast fracture in brittle solids."

S"I try to understand how changes in land use and other human activities alter the structure of ecosystems. Several of my research projects investigate the ecological consequences of deforestation of the world's largest tropical rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon. I study how deforestation changes the way water and dissolved and particulate materials move from land to water and within channels of streams and rivers. I also examine how forest clearing alters the rates of cycling of soil nutrients and organic matter and the emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides from soils to the atmosphere. My research group uses comparisons of gauged catchments, natural abundance of stable isotopes and field stable isotope additions, and paired hydrological and hydrochemical measurements.<br /><br />I also work on the ecology and restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in coastal Massachusetts, where rapid increases in residential development threaten ecosystems that contain high and unique biological diversity. With colleagues at The Nature Conservancy and elsewhere, I conduct large-scale management experiments that examine the effects of treatments, such as clearing or burning on these disturbance-dependent coastal sandplain grasslands and shrublands. In 2007 we initiated a new experiment to test methods for restoring old farmland to sandplain grassland on Martha's Vineyard. I also study the ecology of coastal plain ponds, which harbor particularly high plant diversity along their shorelines."

S"Cell Biology Program <br /><br />Nillni's laboratory has made substantial contributions in studies related to the neurobiology of proThyrotropin Releasing Hormone (proTRH), a precursor protein to TRH (pyroGlu-His-ProNH2). The biosynthesis of TRH and other proTRH-derived peptides follows a protein processing mechanism, which is similar to those described for other secretory peptides. It begins with a mRNA-directed ribosomal translation followed by a post-translational limited proteolysis of the larger precursor, proTRH. This process occurs while proTRH is being transported from the trans Golgi network to newly formed immature secretory granules and beyond. These granules then mature and are targeted to their specific sites of secretion at the plasma membrane of the cell. His laboratory also demonstrated that cleavage of proTRH to generate biologically active TRH occurs at the paired basic residues by the action of two members of the family of prohormone convertases 1/3 and 2 (PC1/3 and PC2), followed by the action of carboxypeptidase E and D.  Recently his laboratory has identified a prodomain present in the amino terminal side of proTRH that could be involved in the proper folding and/or aggregation of proTRH for its proper sorting to the regulated secretory pathway.   Another important prohormone studied in Nillni's laboratory is prooipiomelanocortin (POMC).  His laboratory is actively investigating the processing and sorting of this polypeptide in two brain areas the arcuate nucleus and the brain Stem, which are important sites involved in energy balance regulation. <br /><br />Obesity Program <br /><br />Severe obesity is associated with dramatic changes in body fat content, particularly subcutaneous or intra-abdominal (visceral) fat that results in cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and affects 1 in 3 Americans. A better understanding of the causes of obesity to further develop new anti-obesity drugs lies in uncovering the molecular and physiologic mechanisms that regulate appetite, satiety, and energy balance. Dr. nillni's work in this area provided the first direct evidence for leptin-mediated regulation of preproTRH mRNA expression as well as TRH prohormone processing and secretion. He demonstrated that PC1/3 and PC2 enzymes involved in prohormone processing, are key in the maturation of several anorexogenic hypothalamic peptides important in calorie expenditure, which are regulated by leptin. His laboratory also has defined novel proTRH-derived peptides with potential biologic function(s).<br /><br />Energy expenditure is a pivotal mechanism for maintaining body weight. The hormone leptin, produced principally in adipose tissue, is a key physiologic regulator in providing information on energy stores and energy balance to brain centers that regulate appetite, energy expenditure and neuroendocrine function. One of the major energy expenditure mechanisms is through the action of leptin on TRH and POMC neurons, which produces the peptide MSH. These two anorexigenic peptides are key regulators in maintaining energy balance.  Therefore, the main focus in Nillni's laboratory is to study the biology of different neuropeptides involved in the regulation of energy balance, thyroid function, and thermogenesis."

S'Obesity and its related medical complications including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and cancer account for more than 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. Obesity occurs as a result of a longstanding imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, which is influenced by a very complex set of biological pathway systems regulating appetite. A more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of obesity and regulation of energy metabolism is essential for the development of effective therapies. My laboratory study the biology of different hypothalamic neuropeptide hormones and enzyme nutrient sensors involved in the regulation of energy balance.'

S"Ted Nirenberg, Ph.D., is an associate professor (research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior and is a clinical psychologist. He received his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina- Greensboro in 1980. Over the past five years, his research has focused on injury prevention. In particular, recent projects have examined the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI) with subcritically injured patients who are seen in the emergency department (ED). One of the major studies he recently participated in was a large scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) intervention study for sub-critically injured drinkers (REIS) (funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)).  REIS showed that injured hazardous drinkers in the ED that received a Brief MI and a booster session had reduced negative consequences and alcohol-related injuries one year later, as compared to standard ED treatment. This finding led to an ongoing RCT study (REDUCE) that is evaluating a similar MI intervention with sub-critically injured drinkers that also use marijuana (funded by NIH-NIAAA. A third study (DIAL) examines the efficacy of a telephone delivery of brief MI that was targeted towards MVC patients identified in the ED (funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)). <br /><br />Over the past several years he has received funding from the National Highway<br />Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RI DOT) to develop a prevention program, Reducing Youthful Dangerous Driving (RYDD), for court-referred youth who have been convicted of a driving offense. Preliminary data have suggested that RYDD is effective in reducing future driving offenses and high risk driving. Based on this data he has received funding from the CDC to further study the efficacy of this program. <br /><br />In addition, over the past several years he has served as Co-Director of the Injury Prevention Center (IPC) at RI Hospital. The IPC has received funding from several sources to fund community prevention and research projects. For instance, the Providence Safe Communities Partnership (funded by RI DOT developed a partnership of community and state leaders to implement programs for reducing injuries in the enterprise communities of Providence. This led to a four-year grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to develop the Injury Free Coalition for Kids (IFCK) in Providence at Hasbro Children's Hospital. Presently we have several projects to reduce injury such as home safety, fire safety, car seat distributions, substance abuse prevention, building safe playgrounds, seat belt use, pedestrian safety, and bike helmet distribution. This has led to additional funding for a variety of projects.  We also received a grant from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety to develop a statewide educational program for emergency medicine physicians on screening ED patients for alcohol use problems. A web-based program was developed and its efficacy was tested by a majority of RI ED physicians. The curriculum was assessed through periodic follow-up of self-reported data, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Medical Review Board data, and chart review."

S'My work has explored the social and cultural meaning of nature in early modern central Europe. My first book, <i>Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire</i> (University of Chicago Press, 2007), takes the problem of fraud as a point of entry into the world of alchemical practice in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Holy Roman Empire. Fears of alchemical fraud responded to a vibrant market for alchemy in which ordinary practitioners flourished alongside learned alchemists. Drawing on criminal trials, patronage appeals, contracts, and letters, this project reconstructs the lives and labor of these ordinary alchemists who have been largely invisible in existing historiography. The debates about fraud, expressed in polemical treatises and in courtrooms, make it possible to examine how early modern Europeans distinguished true alchemists from impostors, as well as what was at stake in doing so.<br /><br />My next project, <i>The Lion\'s Blood: Alchemy, Apocalypse, and Gender in Reformation Europe</i> (under contract with the University of Pennsylvania Press), uses the dramatic tale of Anna Zieglerin\'s rise and fall at a ducal court in the 1570s as a point of entry into the intersection of science, gender, and religious culture in Reformation Germany. One of the few women alchemists about whom we have extant sources, Zieglerin practiced alchemy in her own laboratory, recorded her recipes involving a golden oil called the lion\'s blood, and attracted the support of a German duke for her alchemical work. At the same time, she articulated an eschatological program in which she, as a "new Virgin Mary," would use the lion\'s blood to repopulate the world in preparation for the Last Days. In positioning her body and her alchemy at the center of a spectacular cosmic drama, Zieglerin offers an opportunity to explore the porous boundary between science and religion in the era of the Reformation.'

The group includes members from varying background and expertise such as in physics, in electrical, materials and biomedical engineering, and neuroscience. Ongoing research areas embrace development of new probes for listening to and well as inducing neuronal activity within brain microcircuits, aiming at interfacing biological information processors (neurons) with microelectronic and optoelectronic implantable microsystems. In the group's nanophotonic research, one example includes the use of ultrashort pulse laser techniques (to femtosecond timescale) for study of the dynamics of nanostructured electronic materials such as semiconductor quantum dots. Lower dimensional hybrid material systems, such as optoelectronically active nanocomposites of inorganic and organic constituents are being studied at the level of basic light-matter interaction. Another research component involves the development of very high speed, ultralow energy chipscale all-optical switches. Other recent work has involved manipulate states of magnetization in very thin ferromagnetic films by laser light at exceptionally high speeds, that might be of interest to the magnetic information technologies. Recent optoelectronic device research includes advancing semiconductor light sources into the ultraviolet for purposes of exploring the role of these microcrystal light sources on high density optical storage systems and fluorescent-based chemical and biological analytical instrumentation."

S'My research focuses on integrated assessment of climate change.  Given the disparate aspects of the climate problem &#150; from socio-economic drivers of greenhouse gas emissions, to changes in the climate system, to political and economic response strategies &#150; there is a strong need for integrative studies that can inform policy processes.  I seek to address this need by advancing the field of integrated assessment in three areas: (1) understanding links between demography, energy and emissions, (2) approaches to accounting for uncertainty and learning (i.e., changes in uncertainty over time), and (3) analysis of medium-term strategies that keep open long-term policy options while uncertainties are reduced.  For example, in the demography, energy, and emissions area a case study of the United States has demonstrated the potential effects of aging on future energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.  The analysis, carried out with several collaborators, involved the construction of a new set of household projections for the U.S. that quantifies how much the age structure of households might shift over the next 50-100 years.  In addition, new methodology was developed to introduce age structure and household size into an energy-economic growth model.  Emissions scenarios quantified using the new model show that in some cases, aging could reduce future emissions in the U.S. by as much as a third, relative to what would be expected if aging were ignored. Ongoing work is examining the influence of urbanization on future energy use and emission in China and India.<br /><br />My work on uncertainty and learning examines the implications of learning (or changes in uncertainty over time) for climate change policy.  The anticipation that we will learn more over time plays a key role in climate policy debates, particularly over the appropriate timing of emissions reduction policies.  One ongoing area of interest is the global carbon cycle, where we are investigating how much and how fast uncertainty in future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations might change as we learn more about the functioning of the carbon cycle.  A second area of active research examines the potential for anticipating how uncertainty in future population projection may change, and its implications for future greenhouse gas emissions.  Finally, in the area of medium-term response strategies, I am investigating options for climate policy strategies over the next 30-50 years that help link potential long-term climate change targets to short-term actions.  Currently, the ultimate objective of international climate policy is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in the long term at a level that is not dangerous.  Agreement on such a goal is unlikely to occur soon given the substantial uncertainties in long-term climate change outcomes and political differences among parties to the FCCC.  Therefore, strategies for the interim period are needed that keep long-term options open while uncertainties are reduced through learning.'

S'The focus of my laboratory is in understanding signal transduction events using fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Lately, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent (TIRF) microscopy proved to be an important tool for studying molecular events at and in the near vicinity of the plasma membrane.  My lab is equipped with a state-of-the-art two-color TIRF microscope, which we will use to study UV-induced pigmentation in human skin and melanoma behavior. To visualize signal transduction events, we design and generate novel fluorescent probes using molecular biology techniques.  These probes will give us a unique angle in answering biologically relevant questions. <br /><br />My research focuses on the TrpM family of Trp ion channels: understanding their cellular function and the signaling pathways in which they are involved. Most recently, I directed my research towards TrpM1, the founding member of the TrpM subfamily. Despite being identified ten years ago, very little is known about this molecule.  TrpM, initially named Melastatin, was identified from melanocytes as a molecule down-regulated in aggressive melanoma, suggesting a tumor suppressor function for this molecule. TrpM1 is used as a prognostic marker for melanoma tumors: its expression level directly correlates with the metastatic potential of tumors. We showed that TrpM1 is a non-selective ion channel with role in pigmentation. These findings raise new questions and opportunities to understand how pigmentation occurs in human skin, how cells detect and respond to UV radiations and what is the relationship between skin pigmentation and melanoma.'

S'In the area of Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR): Using an animal model, I have demonstrated that the fetus with IUGR has reduced hepatic glycogen content, which increases their risk for low blood sugar during the neonatal period.<br /><br />In infants of diabetic mothers, I have demonstrated fetal hyperinsulinemia as the major factor for the increased problems during the newborn period, including being born too large, low blood glucose, respiratory distress, and failure. I have also demonstrated that being born too large predisposes them to a higher incidence of obesity in the adolescent period as well as diabetes.<br /><br />In very low birth weight infants, and in collaboration with 15 other centers within the Neonatal Research Network, we have evaluated the use of several interventions: surfactant, vit A to prevent chronic lung disease, and the use of inhaled nitric oxide for newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension.

S'A recent effort in our lab is a collaboration with colleagues in the Computer Science Department (Eli Upfal and Franco Preparata). We are investigating the behavior of synthetic and natural nucleosides in DNA hybridization experiments. Our goal is to find a "universal" base with particular characteristics that will allow us to use gapped or patterned probes for Sequencing By Hybridization (SBH). When used for SBH, gapped probes will increase the information content of oligonucleotide based microarrays by at least 100-fold and will lower the cost of DNA sequencing. Our investigation of nucleoside analogs capable of acting as universal bases has resulted in the development of probes containing 8 natural bases and 5 universal bases. When placed in arrays, the probes are capable of selectively hybridizing to perfect complements in the presence of single mismatches. The results indicate that patterned probes will be able to increase the efficiency of SBH.'

S'I am currently working on a book-length project, <i>Community Organizing and the Ecology of Civic Engagement</i>. The book examines community organizations in Baltimore, Memphis, and New York.  The framework for the research centers on the ecology of civic engagement.  By ecology of civic engagement, I mean the terms by which major sectors of the city relate to one another and their role in the structure and function of local political regimes. Relationships are central to politics. People and institutions form relationships, or are brought together, in order to change public policy or enhance the capacity of government to address an important problem.  My book project is concerned with uncovering factors that allow (or inhibit) community organizations to claim a prominent place in a body of civic and political relationships. Its aim is to provide a balanced examination of the strengths and limitations of community organizing, especially in urban communities.<br /><br />With Professor Hilary Silver (Sociology, Brown University) I have gathered data for a research project, "Regime Politics in Providence."  The research assesses whether the election of Mayor David Cicilline has ushered in a shift in both the electoral and the governing regime of Providence.  A regime change would be indicated by the incorporation of new groups into the majority electorate and local government, a shift in the composition of agenda-setters and decision-makers in the ruling governing coalition, and the elevation of a new set of priorities to Providence\'s policy agenda.  Many urban scholars have wondered how, despite its well-known history of political malfeasance, Providence managed to revitalize its downtown and many of its neighborhoods.  The research examines the role of political and economic leadership in that transformation, and asks if a new urban regime is in the process of formation. <br /><br />I developed a data-base of all the urban articles published in four political science journals (<i>Journal of Politics, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science</i> and <i>Political Science Quarterly</i>) and (with Valerie Johnson) to publish articles examining the treatment of urban issues in the discipline\'s major journals. This work has already produced a forthcoming book chapter, "Race and the City: The View from Two Political Science Journals" and builds on my previously published article, "Political Science and Education Research: An Exploratory Look at Two Political Science Journals."'

S'The Trans-Atlantic Project at Brown University<br /><br />The Trans-Atlantic Project at Brown University is an academic initiative based at the Department of Hispanic Studies and supported by Latin American Studies that, since 1996, has been working to advance research, teaching, and conversation among Brown faculty and students on issues related to the new area of "transatlantic studies." Among these issues are the cultural history of exchange between Spain and the Americas, post-colonial representations, the role of Spanish in the U.S., the French avant-garde and its Atlantic dialogue, as well as exile and migrations. The theoretical ground of this research is based on the modern mechanisms of cultural exchange, identity formation and hybridity, geo-textualities, and communication in the new Humanities.<br /><br />Our Project has organized a series of forums, colloquia, and seminars around transatlantic issues at Brown University, Dartmouth College, Universidad de Puerto Rico, and Universidad de Guadalajara. Last year we co-sponsored a seminar on Criticism and Literature in Mexico (with the Universidad Nacional Aut&#243;noma de M&#233;xico), and a colloquium in Madrid on Exile between Spain and the Americas (with the Universidad Complutense de Madrid). Four members of our study group were there. President Ruth Simmons has recommended us to explore the possibility transforming the Trans-Atlantic Project into a center or program at Brown. Nevertheless, we prefer at this moment to consolidate our faculty base and to continue as a research group open to the faculty initiatives. In the near future we have indicated our willingness to be part of the Brown Humanities Center.<br /><br />In the Department of Hispanic Studies we have a new position on transatlantic studies, dedicated to Early Modern Spain and Spanish America. We hope that this new faculty member, Prof. Nicolas Wey-Gomez, will take a leading role in the Project. Also, during the fall of 2003, the Capstone seminar (required for Hispanic Studies\' concentrators) was dedicated to transatlantic issues, and most of the colleagues from our group took turns to lecture at this course.<br /><br />Trans-Atlantic studies has grown from the reconsideration of Europe and the America\'s modern process of cultural exchange and later inquiries concerning early modern colonial/metropolitan interactions, and has been invigorated by post-colonial theory and migration and border studies. In the Humanities, it tends to focus on the cultural configuration of styles and forms that moves back and forth between Europe and the Americas, as well as on translation, travel literature, and dialogical works of fiction. It could be argued that Trans-Atlantic studies belong to the present "post-theory" situation (defined by Ernest Laclau as the need for more empirical work). Also, this new area follows the advice advanced by cultural history: to be free of enclosed positivistic disciplines but also from the hermeneutics of merely discursive "constructions." <br /><br />Our faculty group has gained some national and international attention thanks to its open, inclusive definition of the area as the exploration of cultural encounters between Europe and the Americas through its border-crossing agents and agencies, texts and practices. Because of our academic training, some of us were initially inclined to focus on the Spanish language and culture in Spain, Latin America, and the United States, which includes the study of migration, exile, translation, and communication. Nevertheless, in the last two years our group has been including colleagues from other departments (French, Comp Lit, Latin American Studies, English), as well as colleagues from other universities, such as Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Boston University, University of Puerto Rico, and El Colegio de Mexico and Universidad de Guadalajara, in Mexico. These colleagues have helped us in opening the focus of the Project. <br /><br />Our first experience as a group goes back to 1997 when four colleagues from Brown\'s Department of Hispanic Studies and another colleague from Afro-American Studies went to Cambridge University for a first colloquium with our Hispanists colleagues there. We called this first meeting "Iberoamerican dialogue." Then, a group of Cambridge colleagues, including members of their Center for Latin American Studies, came to Brown for a second colloquium that added to our own Latin American Studies. The presence at Brown of the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes (Professor-at-large in Hispanic Studies), a transatlantic figure of worldwide impact, helped us in developing a second series of dialogues at Brown with colleagues from neighboring universities as well as from Mexico and Spain. In 1999 seven professors from Brown University, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, and Boston University went to Madrid, London, and Cambridge for a series of forums already focused on Trans-Atlantic explorations. A similar group went to Dartmouth College the following year to participate in a symposium on Mexican cultural issues. In 2000, the Universidad de Puerto Rico invited us to participate in a colloquium on the Trans-Atlantic Caribbean, and last year we were invited by the Universidad de Guadalajara to a three-day conference on Trans-Atlantic Mexico with colleagues from four Mexican universities. This was an extraordinary occasion that allowed us to advance the thesis that Mexican modern literature was the product, not only of national history, but also of French, English, Spanish, and American interactions. Instead of imposing a European model, this global view revealed new cultural particularities and even local and regional differences. In the process of sharing papers on intellectual history, travel literature, archeology, cinema, art, and translation, we all experienced the rich potential of a new approach.<br /><br />The products of our meetings are appearing in a series of publications. <i>Signos</i>, the academic journal from the Universidad Metroplitana de Mexico, has dedicated a special issue to our inquiries; <i>Iberoamerica</i> (University of Berlin) has dedicated its 2003 issue to a selection of our papers at the Guadalajara meeting. The University of Western Ontario, Canada, was also inspired by our work and has started the first interdisciplinary course dedicated to Transatlantic studies. Their journal, <i>Research on Comparative Literature</i>, opens its issue No. 14 with a piece by one of our project members. The Mexican publishing house Fondo de Cultura Econ&#243;mica has published two volumes with the proceedings of our first academic conferences, <i>Mexico transatl&#225;ntico</i> (Brown/Universidad de Guadalajara) and <i>Geograf&#237;as literarias del XXI</i> (Brown U.). Papers from the last international conference have appeared in two special issues of <i>La Torre</i> (Universidad de Puerto Rico).'

S"Dr. Mahasin Osman received her Ph.D. in 1996 from Cornell University in Biochemistry Cell and Molecular Biology supported by fellowships from the Agency for International Development and NIH training grant. Her postdoctoral work at Cornell focused on yeast cell polarity and cytokinesis. As Senior Research Associate, funded by American Cancer Society and NIH, she translated her research into mammalian systems. Dr. Osman became Research Scientist with independent laboratory in 2006 funded by the National Cancer Institute.<br /><br />Dr. Osman's research is multifaceted, focused on the mechanisms involved in coupling cell growth and division and their dysfunction in human disease. These are produced by evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit protein complexes involved in decoding and executing intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Thus using well-established and new technology the Osman lab investigates signaling networks that regulate cell homeostasis and underlie diseases such as cancer and diabetes."

S"Alzheimer's disease is one of the most important health problems facing our aging population today.  The cognitive decline and behavioral problems posed by Alzheimer's disease and related dementia disorders produce not only substantial morbidity and mortality for the affected patients, but also a major socioeconomic burden for family caregivers and the community at large.<br /><br />Mild cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized as a prodrome to dementia, usually of the Alzheimer type. A major emphasis of our research is to define the cognitive and behavioral changes that occur during the prodromal stage of dementia called mild cognitive impairment.  We are a site for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a multicenter study funded by NIH, which seeks to define the earliest physical changes in the brain of persons with Alzheimer's disease using advanced neuroimaging techniques.<br /><br />Among the many important behavioral problems seen in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is driving impairment. Currently we are examining the longitudinal effects of dementia on driving abilities in the elderly, using naturalistic recording techniques, in the hopes of developing a computerized screening test for hazardous driving due to such cognitive impairment. <br /><br />Our research also focuses on developing new and effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.  Our center is a major site for multicenter clinical trials of experimental drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including studies that led to the approval of tacrine and donepezil, the first two medications approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and memantine, the latest medication approved for treatment.  We also are studying the long term effects of anti-dementia treatments in the institutional setting using pharmacoepidemiologic research methods."

S'We live in a society based on massive information exchange and energy consumption.  Indeed, the typical data transfer rate in optical fiber networks is of the order of tens of terabits per second (Tb/s).  On the other hand, the worldwide energy consumption is currently estimated to be greater than 14 terawatts (TW), averaged annually, and is expected to exceed 30 TW by 2050.  <br /><br />In order to meet the ever growing worldwide data and energy demands, new approaches and paradigm-shifting strategies are needed to overcome the intrinsic limitation of current technologies.  <br /><br />Our group intends to understand the fundamental physical laws and explore alternative approaches in the following research areas:  Energy harvesting, Optical communication, and Biochemical sensing.<br /><br /><br /><b>Energy</b><br /><br />Solar energy is an accessible, abundant, and sustainable form of energy with average usable insolation estimated to be several times our current worldwide needs.  <br /><br />In conventional photovoltaic devices, the photogenerated charge carriers are collected in the same direction as light is absorbed. Therefore, active layers must be optically thick to enable full light absorption, and at the same time have high crystallinity and purity to allow for efficient photocarrier collection. Solar cell design and material synthesis considerations are strongly dictated by this simple optical thickness requirement, which increases the cost of the photovoltaic module.<br /><br />Reducing the absorber layer thickness by several orders of magnitude (from 10-100 &#956;m down to 10-100 nm) could significantly expand the range and quality of absorber materials that are  suitable for photovoltaic devices. <br /><br />Our goal is to demonstrate efficient solar cells that show enhanced energy-harvesting properties. <br /><br />Among other solutions, we propose to employ the high confinement properties of surface plasmon  polaritons at metal-dielectric interfaces to increase the optical absorption and carrier extraction in thin photovoltaic materials. <br /><br />This work will help circumvent the cost/efficiency trade-off of conventional photovoltaic technologies, leading to efficient and cost-effective solar cells.<br /><br /><br /><b>Information</b><br /><br />Photonic networks with sophisticated functions have the potential to solve problems such as crosstalk, power dissipation, and speed limitations that microelectronics circuits are soon expected to face, and at the same time offer the opportunity for low-cost and high-volume fast communication, new computing schemes, and data-storage solutions.<br /><br />We propose to employ nanoscale plasmonic structures to guide, concentrate and modulate light on the surface of a monolithic integrated-circuit.<br /><br />Our goal is to develop the basic building blocks for photonic circuits and networks that operate at the nanoscale.<br /><br />The proposed work will attempt to integrate plasmonic, electronic and photonic devices on the same chip, exploiting the strengths of each technology. <br /><br />This research activity will enable unprecedented guiding and routing capabilities of optical signals in compact devices, with 100 times smaller area than conventional dielectric waveguides, component footprint less than 45 nm, and switch energies in the order of femtojoules to attojoules, comparable to state-of-the-art microelectronic transistors.<br /><br /><br /><b>Sensing</b><br /><br />Propagating surface plasmon polaritons and localized surface plasmons can be used to enhance detection of chemical or biological analytes by monitoring binding events of molecules to chemically-functionalized continuous metal films.  <br /><br />Typical implementations of plasmonic sensor devices rely on non-scalable approaches, which make use of bulky and expensive prisms and optical components to evanescently couple an incident laser beam and generate a propagating surface plasmon, and monitor a variation in refractive index via a change in the incoupling angle. <br /><br />Our goal is to integrate thousands of biochemical sensors in a single, compact, lab-on-a-chip device.<br /><br />The proposed approach will allow quantitative and qualitative detection of multiple analyte species with an estimated sensitivity to refractive index change better than 1 part per million, and provide a powerful tool for protein-DNA binding studies.'

S'Our laboratory is interested in the developmental regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, and control of cell proliferation and growth in the developing heart and placenta. During the transition from fetal to postnatal life, there are numerous examples of unique expression of genes and/or differential mechanisms for regulation of gene expression and the control of cellular growth that are unique to this developmental period. Moreover, the mechanisms for regulation of development during the fetal and early postnatal period inform important regulatory mechanisms governing cell function, organ maturation, health and disease in later life.  We hold the view that "looking through the prism of development" provides not only insights but in some instances experimental and testable hypothesis for how regulatory pathways are governed.  <br /><br />We are studying the developmental expression and regulation of placental genes.  We have shown that dysregulation of placental gene expression accompanies adverse intrauterine conditions including intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, exposure to recreational drugs.  This dysregulation of gene expression in the placenta is associated with epigenetic changes in several important candidate genes.  These effects likely underlie the mechanisms for "fetal programming."  We are using both a candidate gene approach and a genome-wide approach to identify these mechanisms for the fetal origins of later disease and using the placenta as a model system.  <br /><br />Growth of the heart is highly regulated.  During late fetal and early postnatal life, cardiac myocytes are actively proliferative.  They then exit the cell cycle and are terminally differentiated.  However, this dogma of cardiovascular biology has recently been challenged.  Evidence for cardiac stem cells and the use of bone marrow derived stem cells in the repair and regeneration of adult heart is an active field of investigation.  Our studies show that beta1 adrenergic receptor gene expression and the activity of the Pi3K signaling pathway are developmentally regulated.  We have shown that a high level of tonic signaling through the beta1 adrenergic receptor and coordinate upregulation of all the signaling elements in the Pi3K pathway are driving cardiac myocyte proliferation during the developmental period.  Ontogenetic studies show that the high activity in the Pi3K pathway in the developing heart abruptly decreases as cardiac monocytes exit cell cycle.  We have created a mouse which allows cardiac-specific conditional overexpression of Pi3K and we are exploring the role of this signal transduction pathway in early cardiac growth and development and the mechanisms for repair and regeneration in the adult heart.  <br /><br />We are also interested in the unique role of the placenta in immune protection of the fetus. The fetus is a semi-allograph and fetal placental unit has evolved novel mechanisms for protection against maternal anti-fetal immune responses. Included among these is the expression of immuno-modulatory cytokines, such as IL-10. Polymorphisms in the IL-10 promoter are importantly involved in the clinical course and outcome of autoimmune diseases. We believe successful pregnancy outcome is also modulated by placental IL-10 production. We have cloned all the human variants of the IL-10 promoter and are studying the mechanisms for transcription regulation of this important gene and its role in pregnancy outcome.'

S"The focus of my research is to elucidate the structures and dynamics of the transient macromolecular complexes that drive signaling in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Our primary tool is X-ray crystallography, which we complement with other biophysical and biochemical techniques including NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, CD spectroscopy, kinetic activity assay, among others, which we use to understand how proteins direct cellular signaling  at a molecular level.<br /><br />The central project of the laboratory is to understand the molecular basis of MAP kinase regulation by its interaction with kinases, via scaffolding proteins, and MAPK phosphatases. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the regulation of an extensive set of physiological processes. The KIM phosphatases, including hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) and striatal enriched phosphatase (STEP), bind MAP kinases through a unique targeting mechanism which results in the reciprocal regulation of one another's biological activities. We are interested in understanding the molecular basis for the reciprocal regulation of the KIM phosphatase:MAP kinase interactions to determine how these interactions are modulated and directed by multiple kinase signaling pathways in the cell and how they can be regulated by developing KIM-phosphatase specific inhibitors. We are also investigating how MAPK are regulated by their interactions with scaffolding proteins in order to facilitate phosphorylation by their upstream kinases.<br /><br />A second project in the laboratory is the investigation of bacterial proteins that play a central role in biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. In recent years, genes important for <i>. E coli </i> biofilm formation and propagation have been identified using DNA-array experiments, proteome analysis, and classical knockout studies. Identified genes code for proteins involved in bacterial motility, quorum sensing, and the induction of polysaccharide synthesis. Unfortunately, the specific biochemical functions of many of these genes are unknown. Because protein function is more highly correlated with structure than sequence, we are using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to determine the atomic resolution structures of these proteins and protein complexes to gain insights into their individual and coordinated functions in antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. As an example, we recently used X-ray crystallography, biochemistry and genetic to show that the protein most upregulated in the bacterial persister cells (these cells are a phenotypically distinct yet genetically identical subset of cells that exhibit high tolerance to antibiotics), MqsR, along with MqsA, are the founding members of an entirely novel toxin:antitoxin system in <i>E. coli</i>; this work has provided a basis for developing novel antibacterial therapies that target TA pairs."

S"Professor Paine's research interests are in thin film characterization and processing with a focus on interfaces and interface stability in electronic thin film systems. The evolution of microstructure as a function of processing conditions is being studied in a wide range of materials synthesized by techniques such as physical vapor deposition (MBE, dc/rf magnetron sputtering) and low pressure chemical vapor deposition. Key characterization techniques include x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, in situ reflectivity, and in situ resistivity. Examples of recent project topics include novel semiconductor substrate schemes, low temperature deposition of indium tin oxide transparent conductors, high pressure synthesis, and solid phase epitaxy of strained Si1-xGex.  One ongoing research project focuses on tin doped indium oxide (ITO), which is a transparent conductor widely used in the fabrication of flat panel displays and in other optoelectronic applications, and the relationship between microstructure and electro-optical performance. A particular interest is the development of microstructure when low substrate temperature, low energy deposition methods are employed. This research has direct application to the fabrication of display devices that utilize low weight polymer substrates and for the deposition of ITO on heat sensitive polymer color filters. Professor Paine and his students are also using ultra high-pressure oxidation for the formation of thermodynamically metastable thin film structures. A high-pressure technique has been demonstrated for the fabrication of Si1-xGexO2 oxides that are compositionally congruent with the underlying Si1-xGex alloy. This technique may find application in the fabrication of Si1-xGex-based MOS devices. In addition, the metastable Si1-xGexO2 oxides created by this technique can be chemically reduced under conditions that yield nano-crystalline Ge.  Strategies for the epitaxial growth of low defect density semiconducting materials is another area of active research. Examples include the growth of GaN on lattice matched single crystal Hf substrates, growth of lattice mismatched, and growth on step graded staircase buffer structures. In a related set of of studies, solid phase epitaxial growth on ion-beam amorphized Si1-xGex is being studied to reveal the effect of misfit strain on the kinetics of solid phase epitaxial regrowth."

S'Fluid-like deformations of the solid Earth and planets on geological time scales occurs due to thermally-activated creep driven by  buoyancy forces that arise both from differences in temperature as well as variations in chemical composition.  Differences in composition arise from melting and the extraction of melt.   Even with the high viscosity of the solid mantle, convective motions are fast compared to the time for heat to be conducted over appreciable distances. These rapid, highly time-dependent or turbulent convective motions occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Convective motions give rise to the large scale mantle overturn that we associate with plate tectonics as well as smaller scales of motion associated with intraplate and plate boundary volcanism.  Theoretical models and numerical experiments developed in the context of geological and geophysical observations allow an assessment of the role of these processes in the evolution of the Earth and planets.'

S'Our research is aimed at elucidating how alterations in neurotransmitter  activity in the central nervous system influence behavior. We are especially  interested in determining how chronic administration of a psychoactive drug,  such as amphetamine, alters brain functioning from both a behavioral and  transmitter point of view. In order to analyze the relationship between transmitter release and animal behavior, we use a microdialysis procedure that enables  us to carry out concurrent measurements of transmitter release from the rat  brain while monitoring animal behavior. In vivo release studies are complemented  by in vitro studies of nerve ending (synaptosome) preparations isolated from  discrete brain areas in order to study drug effects on transmitter synthesis, release, and uptake. Our hope is that these combined in vivo and in vitro  studies will help elucidate the mechanisms via which chronic psychoactive  drug administration alters the sensitivity of the brain to subsequent psychoactive  drug exposure.'

S'I study psychoactive drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine for two main purposes: (1) to understand the alterations in the regulation of brain chemicals that can occur as a result of exposure to psychoactive drugs, and (2) to make use of possible animal models of psychiatric disorders. People who use stimulant drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine on a chronic basis can develop a psychosis that is similar to paranoid schizophrenia. This is of interest in light of our findings that chronic administration of amphetamine to rats can increase the utilization of dopamine, a brain neurotransmitter. To show this, we use microdialysis, a technique for analyzing neurotransmitter release in the brain. The alterations produced in transmitter utilization in the rat brain during chronic stimulant drug administration may be very similar to the changes occurring in the human brain exposed to stimulant drugs. These studies may provide insight into the biochemical changes occurring in the human brain that can contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders.'

S'My research program is largely focused on understanding the contribution of subcortical brain systems to cognitive and affective behavior.   Recently I have focused on two conditions that provide opportunities to study subcortical brain systems, including subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  The neuropathology of SIVD and HIV predominately involves both white matter and subcortical gray matter structures. <br /><br />As I began working in these areas it became clear that many questions remained about the evolution and specificity of brain dysfunction in these conditions.  As a result, much of my research in SIVD and HIV has been oriented towards unraveling these complex disorders.  My research studies typically incorporate neuropsychological tests to examine behavioral indices of brain function. These tests are weighted towards domains of function purportedly subserved by subcortical brain systems (e.g., information processing speed).  My research program has also increasingly incorporated structural neuroimaging to determine volumes of key brain nuclei (e.g., caudate, nucleus accumbens) and more recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore the neuronal integrity of brain systems.  DTI is a relatively novel methodology that requires standard MRI hardware and specialized post-processing software.  While traditional structural MRI provides reasonably good differentiation of water content across brain regions, DTI defines the rate and directionality of water movement within brain regions.  DTI is an ideal methodology to examine subcortical white matter because of the linear orientation of these neural fibers and the preferential movement of water molecules along the length of axons rather than across axons. The clinical application of DTI in my research has relied heavily on the work of other investigators at Brown who focus on the utilization of this imaging methodology.'

S"Professor Pearson's research interests are in the area of advanced control systems. Specific focus areas include - Control of Distributed Delay Dynamical Systems:  Systems with distributed delay, like transport lag in chemical plants, are inherently difficult to control owing, in part, to the infinite dimensionality of the system when modeled by differential equations. Research is currently underway on a reducing transformation technique for linear differential distributed-delay systems which facilitates using finite dimensional methods for a variety of control problems. These include feedback stabilization, observers, tracking, approximate lumped parameter models, and optimal feedback control utilizing a separation principle.  The basic aim is to devise a functional transformation on the state of the system such that the reduced order model inherits all the unstable and poorly damped modes of the system; Parameter Identification for Continuous-Time Systems:  Most system identification techniques use discrete-time models for estimating parameters due to the difficulties of working with continuous-time white noise. Research is underway on a modulating function technique that converts the stochastic differential equation model to the frequency domain in a way that obviates dealing with unknown initial/end-point conditions for time-limited input/output data. In this process, the continuous-time white noise is converted to a discrete-frequency white noise sequence that is easier to deal with in parameter estimation.  Applications include perturbation modeling for longitudinal and lateral aircraft dynamics, and non-linear modeling for unsteady aerodynamics with high angles of attack."

His first book is a translation of, and critical introduction to, Kang Ky&#335;ng-ae's 1934 newspaper novel In'gan munje, a classic of literary realism in the canons of both South Korea and the DPRK, which has just been issued by The Feminist Press with the title, From W&#335;nso Pond. Professor Perry has also published on the fiction of Chang Hy&#335;k-shu, and his writing on revolutionary childhood has recently been translated and published into Japanese. His second book, entitled Literary Activism in Proletarian Japan, shows how proletarian artists and activists reconfigured culture into a vital social practice in the late 1920s and early 1930s, opening up new critical spaces in the intersections of class, gender, ethnicity and childhood.<br /><br />His third book project examines the Korean War from the perspective of neighboring Japan and three major communities: resident-Koreans, Japanese colonial returnees, and the ideologically divided Communist Party. Through readings of the mass media, fiction, photography and film produced at the time, the book will assess how the impact of the Korean War was experienced affectively in Japan, as well as how newly embraced concepts of democracy and citizenship were challenged and transformed through the experience of the Korean War."

S"Signaling cascades direct information and, in turn, function from memory to muscle movement important at any stage of life. These cascades are mediated by a network of highly specific, tightly regulated series of protein:protein interactions, including those made by Serine/Threonine kinases and Serine/Threonine phosphatases. Our long-term goal is to achieve an in-depth understanding of this signaling network in the post synaptic density so we will be able to develop highly specific drugs for diseases such as Down's syndrome and mental retardation. Therefore we have started to investigate the role of the Serine/Threonine phosphatase Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) in neuronal signaling, as it is one of the most important protein phosphatases in the brain. Two of the major interaction partners of PP1 in neurons are the large, multi-domain scaffolding proteins Spinophilin and Neurabin. These proteins target PP1 to its cellular point of action, the post synaptic density of dendritic spines. This targeting of PP1 by Spinophilin and Neurabin is responsible for the PP1-mediated regulation of glutamatergic AMPA/NMDA channel activity. To understand the Spinophilin/PP1 and Neurabin/PP1 signaling networks in molecular detail, we will use NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the scaffolding properties of the Spinophilin and Neurabin protein interaction domains, both as isolated domains and in complex with their interaction peptides and binding proteins. Spinophilin and Neurabin also bind and organize actin. It has been shown that this organization is of key importance for dendritic synapses shape and therefore for early childhood learning, development, and memory. Therefore, these 3-dimensional structures, interaction maps, and biochemical studies will provide a detailed understanding of this specificity and will allow us to selectively modulate particular signaling cascades for medical benefit."

S'Linear bone growth and maintenance of articular cartilage both require the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. Much of the work done on chondrogenesis has focused on the role of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis. While it has long been known that nutrient deprivation impairs linear growth, this has widely been considered to be a function of indirect nutrient effects through modulation of the GH/IGF-I axis. However, our preliminary data indicate that the essential amino acid leucine can directly modulate chondrogenesis. Given that chondrocyte differentiation involves cellular hypertrophy, and that the recently characterized mTOR pathway regulates cell size in response to nutrient availability, we hypothesized that nutrient signaling via mTOR might exert direct effects on chondrocytes.This work has the potential to establish a role for nutrients in the indirect regulation of chondrogenesis via insulin and in direct regulation via the mTOR pathway.'

S"Bernardine Pinto, Ph.D., is a Professor (Research) of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown Medical School and The Miriam Hospital. Her research interests have focused in two areas: 1) changing unhealthy behaviors, particularly sedentary lifestyle among adults using physician-based, computer-driven, and home-based intervention channels; and 2) psycho-social issues and health behavior change among oncology patients. She is one of a handful of researchers who has examined the role of health behaviors among cancer survivors. She has developed a systematic body of research that includes cross-sectional, longitudinal assessment studies and intervention trials. She is active in the training of interns and postdoctoral fellows and is the chair of the Diversity Committee in the Brown University Clinical Psychology Consortium.<br /><br />Bernadine Pinto's current research includes:<br /><br />1) Physical Activity Promotion in Cancer Follow-Up Care<br />Bernardine Pinto, Ph.D. (PI) <br />Funding agency: American Cancer Society<br />This study, funded by the American Cancer Society, aims at testing the efficacy of a physical activity intervention in an outpatient oncology setting. Using a randomized controlled design, Brief Advice for physical activity (M.D. advice plus contact control) will be compared to Extended Advice (M.D. advice plus telephone-based counseling by research staff) over three months among 300 women who have completed treatment for breast cancer. Outcomes include physical activity behavior, mood, fatigue, and body esteem assessed at three, six, and 12 months. If the data are promising, the study lays the groundwork for improving cancer recovery by integrating a brief physical activity intervention into follow-up care for cancer survivors. <br /><br />2) Translating Research-based Physical Activity Promotion among Cancer Survivors: A Pilot Study<br />Bernardine Pinto, Ph.D. (P.I.)<br />Funding Agency: Lance Armstrong Foundation<br />Research studies have demonstrated that physical activity adoption among cancer survivors can improve their physical functioning, quality of life, mood, and fatigue. As a first step towards translating these efforts into a community setting, this study will examine the feasibility and effects of a telephone-based physical activity program offered by community volunteers (Reach to Recovery volunteers of the local office of the American Cancer Society) to breast cancer survivors. This pilot study represents efforts to extend the research on physical activity to the community setting by having community volunteers be the channel of intervention delivery, thereby making physical activity interventions much more accessible to survivors.<br /><br />3) Maintaining Exercise after Cardiac Rehabilitation<br />Bernardine Pinto, Ph.D. (PI)<br />Funding Agency: National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI)<br />Maintaining exercise participation among patients who have completed cardiac rehabilitation is integral to secondary prevention of coronary events and cardiac re-hospitalization. Patients in Phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs, a majority being older adults, participate in regular supervised exercise during the program; however, long-term adherence to exercise is poor, with only 30% reporting regular exercise at 12-month follow-ups. To promote exercise maintenance after completion of a 12-week Phase II rehabilitation program, we propose to offer a theoretically based intervention that we have used successfully to promote exercise among older, primary-care patients. This program (Maintenance Counseling) includes brief advice from the Cardiac Rehabilitation case manager at Phase II program discharge followed by telephone counseling based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change and Social Cognitive Theory. Health educators will provide the telephone-based intervention over six months. Using a randomized controlled design, 180 patients will be assigned to Maintenance Counseling or Brief Advice plus Contact Control. Outcome assessments will include an exercise tolerance test (baseline/post-rehabilitation and six months), self-reported exercise participation, motivational readiness for exercise, and objective activity monitoring at baseline, six, and 12 months. These data will help to identify whether telephone-based exercise counseling is an effective strategy for sustaining regular exercise and fitness among cardiac rehabilitation patients thereby contributing to secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.<br /><br />4) Promoting Physical Activity after Colorectal Cancer<br />Bernardine Pinto, Ph.D. (PI)<br />Funding Agency: National Cancer Institute (NCI)<br /><br />Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the U.S. and if detected early, has a favorable prognosis. Colorectal cancer survivors face many physical and psychosocial sequelae including second cancers, adverse effects on major organs, cognitive, and sexual function, problems in work and social roles, and reduced quality of life.  Following adjuvant treatments (chemotherapy and/or radiation), these individuals may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity, osteoporosis and future cancers. There is growing evidence that moderate-intensity physical activity can improve physical functioning, reduce fatigue, enhance vigor, and improve body esteem among those treated for breast cancer. Colorectal cancer survivors report increased fatigue, low vigor, impaired physical functioning, and disturbances in body esteem. However, the group is relatively understudied and the potential benefits of increased physical activity to their recovery have not been examined. This study focuses on enhancing recovery by offering a home-based physical activity program to patients who have completed treatment for colorectal cancer. The program, based on our prior work among breast cancer survivors, consists of telephone&#150;delivered physical activity counseling over three months. The counseling is based on the Transtheoretical Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and elements of Motivational Interviewing. This study will test the efficacy of the physical activity intervention using a randomized controlled design among 134 patients who have completed treatment for colorectal cancer in the past two years. Outcomes will include physical activity behavior, fitness, vigor, fatigue, physical functioning, and body esteem among participants at baseline, three, six and 12 months (post-treatment). We will also track intervention costs and conduct exploratory analyses of moderators and mediators of change to help guide the future development of physical activity interventions to enhance recovery from colorectal cancer."

His current work includes developing a collaborative care intervention for depression and anxiety in veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, examining the impact of depressive symptoms on chronic medical disease management programs, and investigating the impact of chronic medical illness on patients with bipolar disorder.<br />For his VA Research Career Development Award, he is starting with doing a qualitative study of veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to explore the experiences, perceptions, needs, and preferences of veterans with COPD patients regarding depression and anxiety, to better understand the interaction of depression and anxiety with COPD, and to refine conceptual models describing the interaction of depression and anxiety with COPD.  This work will help determine which interventions for depression and/or anxiety in veterans with COPD are most likely to be accepted by these patients.  The second phase of this program is to use the results of the qualitative study to direct the construction of a collaborative care intervention for depression/anxiety in veterans with COPD.  Much of this effort will be towards focusing previously effective techniques on this population.  Ultimately, three stages of deployment will carry this work forward: Stage I) pilot testing in an open trial for feasibility and to refine the intervention, Stage II) local randomized trial of efficacy, and Stage III) the investigation of transportability and generalizability in a multi-site VA Cooperative Study.  The primary product of this program will be the treatment manual for Stage I wherein the components of the intervention are developed and a collaborative care model structure that can be applied to a local open trial are established.'

S'Dr. Politser\'s prior writing has concentrated on the psychology of medical decision-making and the evaluation of medical programs or technologies.  It has been cited in diverse theoretical fields--from biostatistics and decision science, to computing and cognitive science, to economics and management science.  It also has been referenced in publications on anthropology, sociology, education, behavioral sciences and the law and at least 19 other fields of medicine and public health.(clinical chemistry, psychiatry, neurology, epidemiology,  pediatrics, urology, family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, oncology, gerontology, obstetrics and gynecology, also pathology, nursing, and social work, as well as pain, allergy, transfusion and transplantation medicine.<br /><br />Dr. Politser\'s current research is in neuroeconomics&#151;a new field that asks: What happens in the brain when people make decisions about money?  The field promises to clarify economic questions&#151;such as, why people save, strike, or buy stocks; but it is also relevant to clinical problems&#151;such as why people smoke, steal, or overspend.  Dr. Politser recently has shown how neuroeconomic methods may clarify what happens in the brain when patients envision risks or recall side effects and develop mistrust, expectations, or habits.  The research will suggest how to (1) identify decision making disorders (2) help patients follow medical advice; and (3) understand the influences of common medications on decisions.<br /><br />Dr. Politser\'s forthcoming book, Neurorationality (Oxford) is a guide to the use of methods in neuroeconomics&#151;the new science of rational choice.  It is the first book to present guidelines for interpreting the research or for determining its relevance to the most basic question asked by many disciplines: what are the neural correlates of rationality or "good sense.  It is also the first book to apply the new science to mental health and other concepts of rationality.  The book shows how neuroeconomic methods may ultimately clarify some origins of good or poor sense.  For example, neurobiologic research may tell us why some patients have inconsistent values--involving what they recall, experience, expect or want.  They may also show inconsistencies between what they intend to do, what they actually do, and what they feel they should do.<br /><br />Detailed Research Summary<br />Book Description<br /><br />What happens in the brain when people make decisions about money?  Research on this topic has generated intense interest in the popular media, business communities, and diverse scientific disciplines, including economics, psychology, education, political science the law, management, marketing, and mental health.   Yet, to date, no guidelines exist for interpreting the research or for determining its relevance to the most basic question asked by many disciplines: what are the neural correlates of rationality or "good sense"?<br /><br /><br />The present book translates neuroeconomics into the neurorationality&#151;a broader mosaic of capacities than those identified by neo-classical economics.  It discusses different behavioral economic models, which enable a broader variety of neural measures of specific capacities as well as neurobiologic tests of evaluation consistency.  For example, the methods identify inconsistencies in values&#151;such as what we recall, experience, expect or want.  The methods also provide neural yardsticks for measuring disturbances in decision making traits&#151;including desire, regret, expectation, learning, and aversion to risk or delay. In addition, the book introduces a new science of the neuroepidemiology" of decision making, which categorizes the neuroeconomic studies according to the different levels of rational function they address <br /><br />The results may help us interpret neuroeconomic results and inject more sense into different concepts of good sense, including not only economic rationality and mental health but also legal competency and emotional intelligence.  For example, they suggest how disturbances in neuroeconomic measures may define mental disorders more precisely and better predict the value of treatments.   The methods also may inform ethical debates about future technologies intended to enhance even normal function.  The results may help us seek a better balance between normal capacities, which are the product of evolution, and a possibly more rational use of these capacities, which promises greater well-being in the modern world.'

S"Dr Poses went to Brown University as an undergraduate, and got his medical degree from the same university.  He did an internship and residency in internal medicine at University Hospital in Boston, and a fellowship in general internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. <br />     Dr Poses became an enthusiastic proponent of evidence-based medicine, the idea that physicians should practice medicine in the best interests of their patients based not only on their knowledge of biology and traditional medicine, but also on combining the findings obtained by critical review of the best available clinical research with consideration of the individual patients' values and needs.  His research focused on how physicians make judgments and decisions, and why they often do not make them according to the precepts of evidence-based medicine.  He also did original clinical and health outcomes research.<br />&#9;In the late 1990s, Dr Poses performed a qualitative study involving interviews of health care professionals about what they thought had gone wrong with health care.  The results were that physicians felt that their core values were under external threat, and were able to identify examples of threats, most deriving from concentration and abuse of power in health care. He was able to find numerous cases that embodied such threats by searching the news media, but found that the issues they raised were rarely discussed in the national media, and were mostly ignored by scholarly health care and medical publications.  Therefore, he and colleagues launched a blog to discuss these issues, entitled Health Care Renewal, http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/.  Dr Poses is now also President of FIRM - the Foundation for Integrity and Responsibility in Medicine, a not-for-profit organization (NGO) designed to raise awareness of external threats to the core values in health care as the first step toward addressing them."

S'My research seeks to understand the evolution of the Cenozoic climate-ocean system and especially the evolution of the Indian-Asian monsoon system and how it is forced by interaction between regional tectonic changes, orbital forcing, and inter-hemisphere ocean feedbacks. A major thrust in my ongoing collaborative grant with Z. Liu (U. of Wisconsin) is the generation of time dependant GCM simulations of past climate that enable us to directly compare paleoceanographic timeseries to climate model results. This collaboration has already yielded several publications.<br /><br />My estuarine oceanography research seeks to understand the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen cycling in Narragansett Bay as related to the recent and past environmental history of the Bay.  Our NOAA CHRP grant and Brown seed money support have produced exciting results, which were presented at the Estuarine Research Foundation 19th Biennial Conference in Providence in fall 2008.  Topics included the Episodic Summer-Time Hypoxia in Narragansett Bay (Narragansett Bay CHRP) (Prell WL, Murray DW, Orchardo JM, Deacutis C, Saarman E), Grain Size Patterns and Elemental Composition of Surface Sediments from Narragansett Bay (Murray, D.W., Rincon, C.E., and Prell, W.L), and Benthic foraminifers as proxies for the spatial and temporal extent of hypoxia (Narragansett Bay CHRP) (Martin, April H, Prell, Warren L, Murray, David, Heggie, Keira). These initial studies have set the foundation for new proposals on eutrophication and environmental history of the Bay.  To help develop the critical mass of researchers here at Brown, I have worked closely with Jeremy Rich, a new appointment in CES, to develop the seed money proposal "Developing an Interdisciplinary Research Team: Narragansett Bay as a Model System".  The past year\'s research has generated the data for several publications, which are in preparation.  The dynamics of carbon/Nitrogen cycling related to estuarine processes is a hot topic and one that Brown researchers can carve out a niche.'

S"Lawrence Price's primary research interests have involved the phenomenology, clinical psychopharmacology, neuropharmacology, and neurobiology of mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders.  He has published extensively on pharmacologic approaches to the treatment of refractory and psychotic depression.  In this regard, he conducted many of the early studies on the use of lithium augmentation, subsequently extending this work during investigations of fenfluramine, yohimbine, and neuroleptics as augmenting agents.  His more recent studies in this area have addressed the efficacy of maintenance ECT, glucocorticoid antagonists, and atypical antidepressant combination approaches.  He completed a large series of investigations concerning the effects of antidepressant drugs on serotonin function in humans and was involved in pioneering studies demonstrating the relationship between intact serotonin function and antidepressant efficacy in depressed patients using the tryptophan depletion paradigm.  He is currently engaged in studies focused on mood disorders, including the neuroendocrine and neurochemical sequelae of stress and early life experience as risk factors for major affective illness, the use of deep brain stimulation and other electrophysiological modalities in the treatment of intractable depression, and the development of novel pharmacological monotherapy and combination treatment approaches to mood and anxiety disorders.   <br /><br />He was one of the principal developers of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), now considered the standard instrument for assessing treatment response in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).  He was a lead investigator in the first controlled trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of OCD in the U.S. and conducted numerous other studies on this condition concerning symptom assessment, genetics, cerebrospinal fluid metabolite levels, neurochemical function, and novel pharmacologic treatment approaches.

S'Institutional investors hold more than half of all U.S. publicly traded equity, and are thus uniquely positioned as monitors for corporate governance.  Some of them, especially public pension funds, have been active in submitting shareholder proxy proposals on corporate governance topics. However, prior studies on the effectiveness of institutional investor activism have found only inconclusive results.  Managers of public pension funds may be politically motivated, and their actions do not necessarily enhance shareholder value. Other types of institutions may remain passive due to legal constraints or conflict-of-interest resulting from existing business ties with portfolio companies. My research contributes to the ongoing debate on the effectiveness of institutional investor activism by examining whether institutional ownership is associated with reductions in value-reducing corporate merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. I document that public pension funds are the only class of institutions whose presence associates with a reduced likelihood of future M&A activity. This reduction is greater for potentially more harmful M&A activities.'

S"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Inclusion Body Myositis pathogenesis. <br /><br />     The theme of our lab is that intracellular accumulations of misfolded proteins are cytotoxic to specialized cell types due to selective vulnerabilities of certain steps within key signaling, metabolic, cycle control and homeostatic pathways. To model the contribution of intracellular amyloid molecules to the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, we culture primary neurons from control and transgenic mice brain or use transfected neuronal cell lines. Normal and mutated forms of bAPP, b-amyloid and/or tau proteins, central to AD pathogenesis, are then expressed either genetically or from inducible adenovirus and Herpes-based constructs.      <br />     We are actively investigating three essential homeostatic mechanisms: 1) the proteasome degradation machinery, 2) the insulin-responsive, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and 3) mitochondrial metabolism. Manipulations of these paths in cultured cells involve the co-expression of putative 'protective' genes encoded by lentiviruses, generated here or obtained through collaboration. The specific targets we uncover are checked against brain specimens from AD patients. An in vitro-based assay for the insulin pathway target is being set up for use in a high-throughput drug screen. Future studies are planned to further investigate the utility of various heat shock proteins to protect mitochondrial components from AD damage and to explore expression regulation of amyloid transport receptors. <br />     Parallel experiments model another human disorder in which the same Ab and phosphorylated tau molecules are implicated, Inclusion Body Myositis. IBM is a common but incurable muscle disease of the aged which has quasi-degenerative and inflammatory features. Interestingly, b-amyloid accumulates inside IBM skeletal muscle fibers, in contrast to AD where extracellular plaques and soluble species of amyloid are the major focus. We culture primary myotubes from a transgenic mouse for this disorder created here. The targets identified in the neuronal experiments above are re-tested using live muscle cells and frozen biopsy samples from patients.<br />     A potential treatment for IBM could come from finding target(s)of amyloid that are common to both neurons and skeletal muscle. Since a blood-brain barrier is not present in this disorder, drug delivery may be facilitated. Future studies will examine a protein degradation pathway related to FOXO signaling in IBM-like skeletal muscle and whether aberrant cell cycle re-entry is a significant factor in disease pathogenesis. We plan to create an upgraded animal model."

S"Alzheimer's Disease is multifactorial and many biochemical pathways are deranged. A major challenge is to determine their temporal sequence, relative importance, and which are causative, secondary or self repairing. The end result, neuron and synapse loss and accumulation of damaged proteins (amyloids), will require concurrent therapies to arrest or reverse. We explore various targets of amyloid damage, e.g. energy production, protein clearance mechanisms, signaling pathways, calcium regulation and the replication machinery. Several of these are specific enough to have drug discovery potential."

S"Current interests have led me into two new areas of research. The first project, Parting Shots: Eighteenth-Century Displacements of the Male Body at War, investigates the significance of the English Civil Wars on eighteenth-century literature in which the experience and memory of non-foreign conflict changes the representation of masculine identity and institutions. The second project, Eighteenth-Century Miniature: Mimesis Reconsidered, draws on evidence from material culture and literature in order to explain the eighteenth-century practice of reproducing objects in small scale, a practice with ramifications in literature, art, science, and the history of cognition. Past research and publications with continuing interest include Swift, satire, the novel, early modern women's writing, and the ongoing revision of the canon."

S'Dr. Rakowski is recognized for conceptual and empirical work to extend the "stages of change" Transtheoretical Model from smoking cessation to screening mammography.  His research on that topic over the past decade has included both item pool construction and subsequent scale validation, as well the development of empirically-based, individually tailored interventions (R01-CA55917; R01-CA68556).  He was part of an invited NCI panel on tailored interventions that led to a set of seminal articles in a 1999 issue of <i>The Annals of Behavioral Medicine</i>.  Dr. Rakowski is therefore experienced in the area of identifying factors that women consider when making decisions for cancer screening, and translating those factors into interventions.  Dr. Rakowski has been and is a Co-Investigator for several other studies in cancer control.  For example, he is working with colleagues at The University of California-San Francisco (including Dr. Pasick) to study the ethnic/cultural dimensions of breast cancer screening among Filipina and Latina women in a qualitative investigation (R01-CA81816).  He is Co-Investigator for a project housed at the University of Texas School of Public Health (Houston) to implement a tailored intervention for mammography to a national sample of women veterans (R01-CA76330).  In addition, Dr. Rakowski was Co-PI for a study to employ a computer-based, automated telecounseling system to address barriers to mammography among women due for repeat screening (R01-CA84447).  He was Co-Investigator for an NCI-funded study to encourage the performance of skin self-examination (R01-CA78800). He was also a Co-Investigator for a study headed by Dr. Rebecca Silliman that examined the predictors of long-term use of tamoxifen among older women with breast cancer (R01-CA70818), so that he has experience with both pre- and post-diagnosis contexts of breast cancer.  He is a consultant to projects conducted by Drs. William Redd and Kate DuHamel at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City on the development of tailored cancer screening interventions for African-Americans and Latinas.<br /><br />     In addition, many of his publications have used the cancer screening items of the National Health Interview Surveys to investigate risk factors for not obtaining mammography, and he is working with internal NCI researchers and others on analyses of recent BRFSS surveys, the NCI-sponsored Health Information and National Trends Survey (HINTS), the California Health Interview Survey, and the longitudinal Canadian Health Survey.  He is also on the external advisory committee to plan content for the 2007 HINTS.  Dr. Rakowski was awarded a K05 Career Award through the NCI (Established Investigators in Cancer Control and Population Sciences; CA90485; 5/2001-4/2007).  Among other activities, that award has facilitated his work with Dr. Mary Canales at the University of Vermont to study screening in Native American women.  He was on the Steering Committee of a National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and CDC initiative (through the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences) that published a set of papers in the ACS journal, <i>Cancer</i> (September 2004), reviewing "lessons learned" in behavioral and social science cancer screening interventions over the past three decades.'

S'Dr. Rakowski (Professor, tenured)is a behavioral scientist in The Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences in Brown\'s Public Health Program, and is also a Senior Investigator in The Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research.  He has been on the Brown faculty since 1987. His B.A. and M.A. degrees are in Psychology, from the University of Notre Dame (\'72, \'73), and his Ph.D. is from Penn State in Human Development and Family Studies (\'77). Dr. Rakowski\'s research focuses on behavioral science strategies for cancer control, with an emphasis on utilization of cancer screening procedures. He has extended the Transtheoretical Model ("stages of change") to the study of cancer screening, by both instrument development and the evaluation of individually tailored interventions. He also conducts behavioral epidemiology research on population-level datasets (e.g., NHIS, BRFSS, HINTS), to identify factors correlated with receipt of cancer screening. Dr. Rakowski\'s most recent investigations address the receipt of regular/repeat cancer screening.'

S'My scholarship moves back and forth between the Renaissance and contemporary culture.  One of the ways in which these concerns come together is in my abiding interest in the "afterlife" of Renaissance writers and texts.  I\'m currently writing a book called "Mardi Gras Milton" about the English literary traditions that inform nineteenth- and twentieth-century New Orleans Mardi Gras pageantry.  It begins with the first of New Orleans\'s secret Carnival societies: the "Mistick Krewe of Comus," which pointedly took its name from Milton\'s masque. Its inaugural parade in 1857 was titled "The Demon Actors in Paradise Lost."  Elaborate parades dedicated to Spenser, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Tennyson, Byron, and other English authors followed in later years.  <br /><br />My other book-in-progress is about Stanley Kubrick, whose work I see as an extended meditation on masculinity.  I argue that his films are about men&#151;about masculine performance, male desire, male intimacy and sociality, male manners, male rites, male association, male violence&#151;in ways and to a degree that Kubrick criticism has yet to reckon.  I\'m especially interested in Kubrick\'s war films.'

S'Evolutionary Genetics of Mitochondrial Genomes<br /><br />The mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the eukaryotic cell, consuming 90% of the oxygen we breathe and generating 90% of the energy we need to stay alive.  This organelle evolved from a symbiotic association between two divergent microbes that began about 2 billion years ago.  Modern day mitochondria house small, circular genomes that have been shaped by reductive evolution through gene loss and transfer to the nuclear genome.  As a result, mitochondrial function depends critically on cross talk between hundreds of nuclear-encoded genes and the three-dozen genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome.  Thus "mitonuclear" interactions provide rich material for the study of co-evolution and the dissection of metabolic diseases. We are approaching these problems from several angles: 1) the molecular bases of evolutionary change in mitochondrial genes and genomes, 2) the fitness consequences of variation in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions, and 3) the mitochondrial genetics of aging.  For this work we use Drosophila as a model system.<br /><br />Molecular Evolution of mtDNA. DNA sequencing surveys of synonymous and amino acid replacement changes in protein coding genes reveal that mtDNA evolution is not consistent with neutral models of DNA evolution, showing an excess of low frequency amino acid variation consistent with the action of purifying selection.  Recent progress with the Drosophila Species Genome Projects has allowed us to mine mtDNA and nuclear gene sequences from the 12 new genome projects, spanning 50 million years of divergence.  Comparisons of these protein sequences reveal significant functional variation among the five enzyme complexes of the electron transport chain that generates cellular energy.  Future work will involve computational modeling of amino acid substitutions in defined protein structures and functional assays of the genetic interactions governing enzyme activity of these five enzyme complexes.<br /><br />Fitness Consequences of Mitonuclear Interactions in Drosophila. We examine the functional genomics of joint mitonuclear interactions by placing alternative mtDNAs onto defined nuclear genetic backgrounds.  Typical experiments involve population cage competition experiments, or specific chromosome inheritance assays where we can measure the evolutionary fitness of genotypes carrying different combinations of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.  We use genetic crosses to construct strains of flies carrying their own mtDNA on a native set of chromosomes (the "home team") and compare these to a strain of flies carrying a foreign mtDNA on the same set of nuclear chromosomes (the "away team").  The rich genetics of Drosophila offers many ways to manipulate mitonuclear genotypes for functional analysis of whole animals or enzyme activities.  Recent studies have identified a specific gene on chromosome 2 that shows strong epistatic interactions with particular mtDNA genotypes.  These experiments seek to dissect the genetic interactions underlying metabolic diseases.<br /><br />Mitochondrial Genetics of Aging. A leading hypothesis for the cause of aging is the production of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria.  We are testing this hypothesis using genetic manipulations of nuclear-mitochondrial interactions.  We have shown that alternative mtDNAs alter the patterns of aging in a nuclear-background dependent manner.  We have further shown that mitochondrial genotype alters the longevity-extending effects of dietary restriction, and that hypomorphic mutations of insulin signaling (chico) can rescue this mitochondrial defect.<br /><br />Evolutionary Genetics of Thermal Stress <br /><br />We have conducted thermal selection experiments that have altered the genetically based thermal tolerance of Drosophila.  Through continuous culture at different temperatures, or selective breeding of temperature resistant vs. temperature sensitive flies, we have constructed genetically differentiated strains of Drosophila.  Using genomic scans of molecular markers, we have identified a gene region that is responsible for part of this phenotype.  We are in the process of fine-scale mapping and mutant analysis to identify the gene involved.  Our current candidate gene region also shows latitudinal variation in allele frequency, suggesting that this gene plays a general role in adaptation to different climates.<br /><br />Ecological Genetics of Barnacles. We have shown that barnacles from different tidal heights in the intertidal zone are genetically differentiated for key enzymes of glycolysis.  Alternative homozygotes of the Mpi and Gpi allozyme loci show significant tidal-height zonation, with Mpi exhibiting strong zonation in Maine and Gpi showing zonation in Rhode Island.  Survivorship experiments with the substrates of these enzymes (mannose and glucose, or different plankton) indicate that genotype zonation is mediated by the combined effect of thermal stress and the availability of these sugars in the diet. Sequence analyses of the Mpi locus have identified the specific amino acid change that causes the enzyme polymorphism and sequence polymorphism surveys indicate that balancing selection has operated at this locus.'

Specifically, her group is currently investigating the sintering of nanoscale single crystals and stress evolution in chemical vapor deposited diamond thin-films.  Professor Rankin utilizes in situ electron microscopy to investigate initial-stage sintering and particle coalescence in faceted ceramic oxide powders. These studies have revealed new and exciting details of the atomistics and dynamics of neck growth and have spurred several theoretical investigations of particle coalescence in faceted systems. In addition, she is investigating the influence of corner and edge energies on the equilibrium crystal shape of nano-sized single-crystals of silicon and other faceted nanocrystals.  In related work, Professor Rankin's group has been investigating the use of novel infiltration techniques in partially sintered ceramic compacts of sub-micron and nano-sized starting particles of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to suppress the grain growth during the final stages of processing. These infiltration techniques include the chemical vapor deposition of amorphous silicon nitride and the liquid phase introduction of Zr-n-propoxide to form particles of ZrO<sub>2</sub> within the pore structure. Both techniques have been shown to cause significant grain growth suppression at much smaller volume percents of second phase than those attainable by traditional powder mixing techniques.  Additionally, Professor Rankin is interested in intrinsic stress and grain alignment in diamond films. This study utilizes high-resolution TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques to investigate the form and the role of intergranular carbon phases on the observed stress reduction in diamond films grown with a multi-step processing scheme. Recent work in Rankin's lab involves the control and optimization of sol-gel processing routes in the fabrication of titania thin-films."

S"Our group has been studying the efficacy and safety of gamma capsulotomy in the treatment of intractable OCD.  32 patients have now been operated on and followed for a minimum of one year and a maximum of five years. 13 of these patients had a two stage surgical procedure and 17 patients have had a single stage procedure.  The first group of 15 patients received bilateral single doses of 180 Gray gamma irradiation to the anterior limb of the internal capsule.  At an average of eight moths following the procedure, only one out of the 15 patients was much or very much improved on the CGI.  There was no significant change in Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) ratings. 13 of the 15 patients received a second stage procedure that was a bilateral lesion placed just ventral to the initial lesion in the coronal plane. Six out of the 15 patients were much to very much improved at one-year follow-up.  Two of 15 patients had a small asymptomatic caudate infarction following the procedure.  Other adverse events included headache and cerebral edema following the procedure.  No adverse effect on personality or neuropsychologic testing was found. 17 additional patients have now been given two shots bilaterally in a single stage procedure to the anterior limb of the internal capsule.  Follow-up at one year has shown that forty percent of patients appear to be much or very much improved on the CGI. The rate of improvement is faster with the double shot procedure than the staged procedure, but the incidence of  cerebral edema is increased with the two shot procedure.  One patient out of 32 has developed a probable mild frontal syndrome with apathy and amotivation. Additional data related to the safety and efficacy of this procedure in the treatment of intractable OCD will be discussed. In summary, forty percent of previously treatment-intractable patients appear to be significantly improved with gamma capsulotomy with minimal adverse effects.<br /><br />The OCD Collaborative Genetics Group has completed a genome-wide linkage study in a large collection of pedigrees segregating OCD.  The results are promising; four genomic regions were identified that are likely to include susceptibility genes and merit intensive follow-up. In addition to pursuing these regions in this proposal, we propose to extend our sample with the recruitment of additional families, using the identical criteria and assessment protocol, to replicate our findings and to identify new candidate regions. To accomplish this goal, we have expanded the Collaborative group to include two additional centers, the Universities of Florida and Minnesota, and propose to collect an additional 530 families (excluding 67 that are available now). A genome-wide linkage scan, using a panel of 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), will be conducted on these additional families to replicate the original findings and, using the entire sample, to identify additional genomic susceptibility regions. Simultaneously, a sample of triads (N = 550, affected proband and both parents) will be recruited and assessed to strengthen the power of association and linkage disequilibrium in the final phase of this proposal, which is to refine the regions further and identify susceptibility genes using fine-mapping and gene sequencing techniques. Analytic strategies, already in process, using the available clinical material to refine the definition of the phenotype, will be employed to inform the molecular approaches. The present group of academic centers has collaborated over the past five years with demonstrated ability to recruit and diagnose individuals with this disorder. The clinical and genotype data from the cases will be publicly available for OCD genetics research. The results of these analyses will guide future molecular strategies to identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of OCD.<br /><br />The goal of this grant is to delineate the neural network and physiology underlying the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for OCD using a series of integrated translational experiments that involve: 1. functional neuroimaging in humans (aim 1), 2. tract tracing in nonhuman primates (aim 2), and 3. electrophysiology in rodents (aim 3).  A better understanding of the underlying neural circuitry of psychiatric disorders is a key element for developing the next generation of effective treatments.  The frontobasal ganglia circuit is implicated in several major psychiatric disorders, including OCD. Converging evidence focuses on the ventromedial prefrontal cortical-basal ganglia circuitry.  In particular, correction of hyperactivity in orbital frontal cortex (OFC) is a common factor across effective pharmacological, behavioral, and neurosurgical therapies.  Furthermore, our pilot studies using DBS, a proven therapy for intractable movement disorders, show that the most promising target for DBS for OCD is in the ventral anterior internal capsule (VC) and adjacent ventral striatum (VS).  Importantly, the ventromedial prefrontal cortical-subcortical afferent and efferent projections course through and converge at this location.  However, there are several specific pathways at this site that may modulate OFC activity.  We will focus on two competing hypotheses: 1. that DBS acts primarily via fibers directly connecting the OFC with the thalamus (aims 1, 2.1, 3.1, and 3.2) and 2. that DBS indirectly modulates OFC activity primarily through its stimulation of the VS pathways (aims 1, 2.2, and 3.3).  Furthermore, an additional goal of the experiments is to delineate other key structures and transmitters, most specifically dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5HT), that may be involved at different loci of DBS in the VS (aim 2.3).   <br /><br />Aim 1.  Functional Neuroimaging in Humans: Aim 1 will delineate the brain activation profile associated with acute VC/VS DBS in OCD by using PET measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Initial treatment data suggest that stimulation at the two ventral contacts (#0 and #1) of the DBS electrode, corresponding with locations in VS and VC respectively, is associated with optimal therapeutic response. Preliminary PET data indicate that acute stimulation at the #0 contact alone is associated with activation of OFC, area 25, striatum, pallidum and thalamus. <br /><br />1.1) will delineate the activation profile associated with acute DBS at contacts #0+1 vs. control conditions. We hypothesize that acute DBS at contacts #0+1 vs. DBS off (as well as vs. DBS on at contact #3, a dorsal stimulation control condition) will yield activation of OFC, area 24, area 25, striatum, insular cortex, pallidum, and medial thalamus.<br />1.2) will dissect out component contributions of individual contacts separately (#0 alone vs. off; #1 alone vs. off). We hypothesize that #0 vs. off will yield activation of OFC (medial area 11), area 25, ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and medial thalamus. We hypothesize that #1 vs. off will yield activation of OFC (lateral area 11), area 24, insular cortex, central striatum, central pallidum and medial thalamus.<br />1.3) will test for significant correlations between brain activation during acute DBS and clinical outcome. We hypothesize that activation in OFC during acute DBS will be correlated with clinical response to chronic DBS.<br /><br />Aim 2. Neuroanatomical studies in non-human primates.  Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that DBS at different locations within the VC and VS will involve separate components of the ventromedial prefrontal cortical-subcortical pathways. Using anterograde tracer injections, we will determine the course taken by fibers from different orbital and medial prefrontal and thalamic regions at three different sites (two at different dorso/ventral locations within the main VC and one in the ventral VS).  A three-dimensional model will be created to illustrate which fiber bundles are affected at different DBS points. Finally, since DA and 5HT fibers ascend through this forebrain region and their terminal distributions vary in different regions of prefrontal cortex, aim 2.3 will focus on the organization and position of these ascending fibers.<br /><br />2.1) will delineate the pathways that pass through two different loci of the VC.   We predict that sites in the VC connect areas 24 and lateral OFC (lateral area 11, area 13, and 12) to specific thalamic and subthalamic regions.  <br />2.2) will delineate both the pathways that pass through, and those that terminate within, the VS.  We predict that fiber bundles embedded within the VS carry ascending and descending connections of areas 25 and medial OFC (medial area 11, 14, and 13a/b), including connections with the amygdala, hypothalamus, and midline thalamic n.  Furthermore, fibers that terminate in the VS, in addition to those originating in prefrontal regions, will also include ascending fibers from the amygdala, thalamus, ventral tegmental area, and dorsal raphe n.    <br />2.3) will identify the organization of DA and 5HT fibers at each part of the network.  Using material from Aim 2.1 and 2.2, sections will be doubled-labeled for DA and 5HT immunohistochemistry to determine their course through the VC and VS as well as the relationship between their cortical terminal fields and ascending pathways from thalamus and amygdala.<br /><br />Aim 3: Electrophysiological studies of DBS in a rat model.  Aim 3 will determine which candidate pathway (direct, via the thalamus; or indirect, via the VS and ventral pallidum) activated during DBS primarily modulates OFC activity patterns.  We will examine the impact of stimulation within a site that is homologous to the VC/VS of primates (i.e., the core of the accumbens) on the electrophysiological activity of OFC output neurons.  The functional hypothesis is that DBS affects OFC as a consequence of repetitive stimulation, and this occurs via induction of LTP within either the OFC-medial dorsal thalamus (MD) pathway or the OFC-accumbens pathway.  We plan to evaluate this by examining the effects of high- versus low-frequency stimulation within the core of the nucleus accumbens on baseline and stimulation-evoked changes in population activity of layer-three and layer-five pyramidal neurons within the OFC, and how this response is affected by selective elimination of alternate pathways.  <br /><br />3.1) will transect OFC pathways to the caudal to the stimulation site to evaluate the contribution of OFC-MD afferents on changes in OFC activity. <br />3.2) will transect OFC pathways rostral to the stimulation site to evaluate the contribution of OFC neuron antidromic activation to changes in OFC activity.  <br />3.3) will use ibotenic acid lesions of nucleus accumbens neurons to evaluate the contribution of accumbens efferent pathways <br /><br />By delineating the effects of stimulation on individual pathways likely to be involved in DBS, these experiments will provide a critical foundation for examining how modulation of activity within these pathways may ultimately lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.  The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to understand the mechanisms by which specific circuits are likely to play a primary role in the therapeutic response and to use this information to optimize treatments.<br /><br />The overall goal of this proposal is to complete the first definitive controlled trial of a neurosurgical procedure for a severe psychiatric illness. Our preliminary data shows promising therapeutic effects of DBS in the treatment of refractory OCD. The target stimulation site, the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS), was based on ten years of our preliminary work in lesion and DBS procedures for OCD. In addition to our empirical data there is a well-defined theoretical rationale, as the VC/VS contains neuronal connections consistently implicated in OCD. In contrast to lesions, DBS is reversible and adjustable and has been refined during approved use in over 30,000 patients worldwide for medically intractable Parkinson's disease and tremor. In six years of preliminary work we have refined the surgical targeting, stimulation parameters, and patient selection, permitting the design of a definitive trial. Collection of definitive controlled data is the essential next step in the development of DBS for OCD as well as for other psychiatric indications such as severe, intractable depression.  This therapy offers potential relief to thousands afflicted with otherwise untreatable illness. <br /><br />We will use a parallel controlled design to compare effects of three months of double-masked sham versus active DBS on OCD severity. We propose a five-year study in order to gather crucial long-term effectiveness and tolerability data.  A total of 45 patients (six per year in years one through four will be enrolled at three sites.  The primary efficacy measure will be the YBOCS. We will also assess effects on comorbid depression, functioning, and quality of life, as well as potential adverse effects in multiple domains. Patients will have positron emission tomography (PET) scans at baseline and after three months of DBS, to test hypotheses that 1) frontobasal brain metabolism will change with response, and 2) frontobasal metabolism before surgery will predict response. Our specific aims are to determine the following:<br /><br />1. Efficacy of DBS in OCD:  To determine the effects of three months of masked VC/VS stimulation on OCD symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in patients with treatment-resistant OCD compared to sham stimulation. The primary working hypotheses for Aim 1 are:  A) three months of DBS using the technique developed in our pilot work will result in improvement in OCD and in global functioning defined as a 35% or greater YBOCS score decrease plus a minimum GAF score of 50, and B) response will persist with open DBS for one to four years. The secondary working hypotheses for Aim 1 are: A) compared to sham stimulation, three months of blinded active DBS will be associated with improvements in quality of life on the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q); and B) these benefits will persist during one to four years of open stimulation. <br /><br />2. Safety and Tolerability of Chronic DBS in Intractable OCD: To obtain comprehensive data on adverse effects including changes in personality, neuropsychological function, psychiatric symptoms, and neurological status, and other potential adverse effects. The neuropsychological battery will emphasize features of cognition, personality, and behavior attributed to the frontobasal networks that we expect to modulate. The working hypothesis for Aim 2 is that implantation and chronic DBS will have an adverse effect profile superior to that in our own prospective study of gamma knife capsulotomy for refractory OCD assessed cumulatively at 12 months.<br /><br />3. PET neuroimaging predictors of response and changes with chronic treatment. To determine patterns of brain metabolism at presurgical baseline that predict response to DBS and to determine changes in metabolism after successful DBS. The working hypotheses for Aim 3: A) at presurgical baseline, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolism in corticobasal regions implicated in OCD pathophysiology (orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and midline thalamus) will predict the degree of eventual response to chronic DBS, and B) that three months of chronic DBS will be associated with metabolic reductions in these same regions.<br /><br />We propose to continue the Longitudinal Brown Obsessive Compulsive Study (LBOCS), a unique, naturalistic, prospective study of 400 subjects whose primary reason for seeking treatment was OCD, for an additional five years of follow-up. This will enable us to obtain a minimum of seven years of follow-up on all subjects and to incorporate new assessments and data analysis methods in order to address important unanswered questions while developing a comprehensive picture of the longitudinal course and outcome of OCD. It will provide important new and clinically relevant information about prognosis, rates of remission and relapse, predictors of remission and relapse and treatment received that will in turn have significant implications for public health policy.<br /><br />Our specific aims are to (1) determine the course, stability, and outcome of selected OCD phenotypes (2) collect comprehensive treatment data on the long term effects of SRIs, augmenting medications, and cognitive behavior therapy (3) to determine the patterns of course and outcome of a clinical sample of children and adolescents with OCD and compare them to a clinical sample of adults with OCD. Subjects will be evaluated at one-year intervals with instruments that obtain detailed information on symptom status and severity, diagnostic status, treatment received, psychosocial functioning, and other domains. Since the last submission we have added new assessments that measure stressful life events, underlying mood- and anxiety-related traits, and symptom severity independent of diagnosis and functioning; we have also incorporated new data analysis methods in order to answer important questions about OCD. To have sufficient statistical power to test our hypotheses, five more years of prospective observation are needed.<br /><br />The LBOCS data set is unique in its large number of subjects, comprehensiveness of assessment, and length of prospective follow-up.  This proposal will allow us to more completely investigate the aims and hypotheses of the previously funded grant and to add new, previously unexplored aims and hypotheses generated by findings from LBOCS and other investigators during the past four years.  Continuation of LBOCS is expected to shed new light on clinically and theoretically important, innovative questions about an understudied major psychiatric disorder that have not been adequately addressed by previous research."

S'Aesthetics is understood in Redfield\'s work both as a historically constituted discourse and as a disturbance within discursivity itself.  Historically speaking, the discourse we now call "aesthetics" splits off from moral philosophy in Britain, and Wolffian rationalism in Germany, as a debate about "taste."  The possibility of a judgement of taste implies the existence of a fundamental harmony between the senses and the intellect, or between the interested individual and universal law; thus aesthetics is able to conceive of the disinterestedness of aesthetic experience as a moment during which individuals achieve a proleptic identification with humanity itself. By  producing subjects capable of disinterested reflection, aesthetic education in principle produces subjects capable of recapitulating the state\'s universality.  And acculturation prepares the consensual grounds for representative democracy: hence the persistent emphasis, in nineteenth-century European middle-class writings, on (aesthetic) education as a prerequisite for political enfranchisement.<br /><br />Redfield\'s work on aesthetics seeks to show, however, that this discourse raises problems that cannot be addressed from a strictly functionalist perspective&#151;one, in other words, that would see aesthetics simply as a tool for cultural domination. Because aesthetics dreams of a moment when meaning becomes visible as form&#151;where the essential structure of the sign promises to unfold itself as experience or intuition&#151;a close textual analysis becomes necessary in order to account for persistent patterns, deviations, and peculiarities within aesthetic discourse. <br /><br />Phantom Formations and The Politics of Aesthetics approach this task in different if related ways. The first book routes questions about literature, theory, and aesthetics through a study of the semi-mythical genre of the Bildungsroman; the second focuses on the crisis-ridden concept and institutional field of romanticism. Both books target overdetermined areas of aesthetic discourse.  The idea of the Bildungsroman offers the lure of a properly aesthetic genre&#151;a genre that would unite the education of a subject with the production of a text&#151;but the lure is phantasmal: the closer one looks at the texts that are supposed to be the genre\'s exemplary constituents, the more violent and unharmonious the aesthetic plot of Bildung becomes.  In a similar fashion, romanticism, both as a term and as a field, suffers instabilities to the degree that it relies for its self-definition upon aesthetic claims (the organic text, the symbol, the creative imagination) that the literature itself famously debunks: romanticism thus comes to serve as a phantasmatic origin both of aesthetic (or "romantic") ideology, and of the "literary theory" that constitutes the reverse side of aesthetics.  Phantom Formations focuses on writings by Kant, Schiller, and various twentieth-century theorists, in addition to novels by Goethe, George Eliot, and Flaubert; The Politics of Aesthetics devotes chapters to aesthetic theory, nationalism, and various texts by such authors as Matthew Arnold, Benedict Anderson, Friedrich Schlegel, Paul de Man, and Percy Shelley.<br /><br />Redfield\'s most recent book, The Rhetoric of Terror: Reflections on 9/11 and the War on Terror (2009) presses some of these issues into the present tense.  The terrorist attacks of September 11 inspired hypernationalist responses because nationalism is bound up with media and mediation. The attacks did symbolic as well as literal damage, with traces of this shock legible in the American idiom "9/11": a bare name-date conveying both a trauma (the unspeakable happened then) and a claim on knowledge. Redfield proposes the notion of "virtual trauma"&#151;the shock of an event at once terribly real and utterly mediated&#151;to describe the cultural wound that this name-date both deflects and relays. Thus a tormented self-reflexivity characterizes representations of 9/11 in texts, discussions, and films, such as World Trade Center and United 93.  Redfield then goes on to examine the historical and philosophical infrastructure of the notion of "war on terror," arguing that the declaration of war on terror is the exemplary postmodern sovereign speech act: it unleashes war as terror and terror as war, while remaining a crazed, even in a certain sense fictional performative utterance. Only a pseudosovereign&#151;the executive officer of the world\'s superpower&#151;could have declared this absolute, phantasmatic, yet terribly damaging war. <br /><br />Though politicized terror and absolute war have their roots in the French Revolution and the emergence of the modern nation-state, Redfield suggests that the idea of a war on terror relays the complex, spectral afterlife of sovereignty in an era of biopower, global capital, and telecommunication.  Jacques Derrida\'s groundbreaking philosophical analysis of iterability&#151;iterability as the exposure to repetition with a difference elsewhere that makes all technics, signification, and psychic life possible&#151;helps us understand why questions of mediation and aesthetics so rapidly become so fraught in our culture; why efforts to repress our essential political, psychic, and ontological vulnerability generate recursive spasms of violence; why ethical living-together involves uninsurable acts of hospitality.'

S'My current book project, <i>THE AFFECTIVE LIFE OF LAW: POSTWAR JUSTICE AND THE LITERARY IMAGINATION</i>, situates modernism both in relation to war and law; it also examines how a modernist legal and literary imaginary is reshaped between the world wars, tracing the process through which trials became the primary mode of doing justice in the aftermath of historical catastrophe.  The notion of "doing justice" on a large scale after World War I is rarely associated with courts of law, figuring more often as social or military justice.  Following World War II, however, historic trials &#151; among them, the Nuremberg and Eichmann trials &#151; came to dominate a broader, international sense of postwar justice.  My work asks what lies behind this shift, and seeks to explain it in cultural and literary terms.  The book argues that literature\'s response to the First World War does more than simply reshape language along ironic or subjective lines; rather, it actively fashions normative claims about what it means to feel responsible, and to take responsibility, in the aftermath of incommensurable catastrophe.  These new modes of justice in turn lay the foundation for what would become the unprecedented trials after the Holocaust.<br /><br />One of the book\'s primary assertions is that issues of affect are central to law, and that this dimension of the law can best be understood through the study of literature. It asserts, moreover, that this affective element of the law comes into sharpest focus by examining literary texts that record moments of historical crisis. Through readings of literary works, legal opinions, juridical treatises, and historical documents, this study charts the emotional terrain that underwrites the law, turning to literature as a means to express and to map those submerged, often unspoken sentiments that underpin strict legal doctrine.'

S"Neutrophils are capable of recognizing linear polymers of glucose linked in &#223;-1,3 conformation (viz., &#223;-glucan) which is a cell wall component of infectious microorganisms including yeast, fungi and bacteria. The recognition of &#223;-glucan by these cells is of benefit to host defense in two ways: first, since glucose does not occur in mature mammalian glycoproteins, &#223;-glucan provides a recognition mechanism through which neutrophils can bind and clear microorganisms without the need for opsonization; and second, &#223;-glucan binding stimulates neutrophil functions including chemotaxis, phagocytosis and oxidative burst. However, the mechanism(s) by which these inflammatory cells recognize &#223;-glucan is not defined. Work in this laboratory suggests that human neutrophils detect &#223;-glucan through novel interactions with cell surface integrins producing subsequent effects on cell motility. Ongoing efforts are directed at defining the mechanism(s) of this recognition and the second messenger signalling events that are triggered within the migrating cell. This work entails microscopic techniques in cell migration and immunocytochemistry, as well as protein biochemistry and molecular biology to investigate intracellular signalling pathways.<br /><br />Translational Research: Although the innate immune system has been studied for a number of years, a well-defined pharmacological intervention to beneficially prime the function of neutrophils or macrophages is still lacking. This is so because the favorable aspects of cell priming needed to improve host defense is often accompanied by the overproduction of proinflammatory mediators at levels that cannot be tolerated by human subjects. PGG-&#223;-glucan, a soluble form of &#223;-glucan extracted from Saccharomyces cerevsiae, has been shown to prime leukocyte functions while not eliciting cytokine production in experimental animals and in high-risk surgical patients. It is this desirable property of PGG-&#223;-glucan that allowed for its evaluation in clinical trials where it was well tolerated by patients participating in phase III studies at the doses used in this report and underlies its therapeutic potential as an immunomodulator. Therapeutic opportunities in improving host response to cancer and infectious disease are being pursued by Biothera, Eagan, MN<br />(http://www.biotherapharma.com).<br /><br />Lab Members:<br />Liz Lavigne, Ph.D./Post-doctoral fellow<br />444-4273<br /><br />Dipan Patel, MD, Department of Surgery Resident<br />444-4275<br /><br />Xian O'Brien, BS/Brown University Graduate Student<br />444-4295<br /><br />Kate Heflin, BS/Brown University Graduate Student<br />444-4294<br /><br />Courtni Newsome, BS/Brown University Graduate Student<br />444-4294<br /><br />Estephany Flores, BS/project manager<br />444-0382<br /><br />Angel Byrd, BS/Brown University MDPHD Graduate Student<br />444-4294"

S'&#223;-glucan is a (1,3)(1,6)-beta-linked polymer of glucose normally found as a structural component of the fungal cell wall. Since beta-glucan is not expressed in mammalian cells, it is an example of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that permits leukocytes to recognize microbes as foreign. Although PAMPs are now understood to be a significant aspect of nonself recognition, mechanisms that regulate the subsequent host response to these molecules are not well understood. When purified and injected in soluble form, &#223;-glucan has been shown to prime the innate immune system without cytokine production. Experimental animals receiving &#223;-glucan showed improved outcomes when challenged with pathogens or tumors.'

S"In her research, Amy G. Remensnyder focuses on the cultural and religious history of medieval Europe. She is currently writing a book about how Spanish Christians shaped the Virgin Mary as a symbol of the twinned colonizing enterprises of conquest and conversion in medieval Spain and early Spanish America. The book starts with the eleventh century and ends in the seventeenth century. It thus brings together contexts that have been kept apart by the scholarly dividing lines between the medieval and early modern periods, and between the Old and New Worlds. It also brings together minorities whom historians most often treat separately: Jews, Muslims, those Jews and Muslims who converted to Christianity in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (conversos and Moriscos), and the indigenous peoples of the New World. <br /><br />Remensnyder's inclusion of this range of social actors is dictated by the project's analytic core: through the Virgin Mary, she examines the dynamics of Christian and non-Christian identity in the pre-modern Spanish world. This approach distinguishes her research from the surprisingly few scholarly studies that have been done of the Virgin in the pre-modern world. These often have a biographical tone: Mary herself is the focus. Remensnyder instead uses the Virgin as a lens to understand how people established identities for themselves in the contexts of domination and devotion. <br /><br />In the first half of the book, Remensnyder looks at how Spanish Christians used the Virgin to draw lines of demarcation between themselves and non-Christians. These could be metaphoric lines of identity created by doctrinal differences and religious polemic, or they could be physical ones of war. In this section of the book, Remensnyder is particularly interested in Mary's martial function, an aspect of the Virgin that has been glossed over by most historians, perhaps because it disturbs their understanding of her as a compassionate maternal mediator. The book  also explores how Mary was a point of distinction around which Christians, Jews, and Muslims could articulate oppositional identities. But while the Virgin symbolized military confrontation and religious borders, she could also embody religious borderlands, the places of hybrid and fluid spiritual identities. Accordingly, the second half of the book looks at how the Virgin served as a place of passage where religious lines could be crossed through conversion.  The book considers Christian stories that depict Mary as a particularly effective agent in the conversion of Jews, Muslims, and natives of the Americas. The project also examines those Jews, Muslims, and Indians who converted to Christianity: the Virgin was a figure of power through whom they could express their new hybrid identities.<br /><br />Remensnyder's current research is rooted in her long-standing interests in how cultural images can profoundly affect social and political realities. In her first book, <i>Remembering Kings Past</i> (Cornell, 1995), she considered how collective or communal memories are shaped by present needs and can themselves come to influence the present. This book focused on the foundation legends which forty southern French monasteries embroidered for themselves in the Central Middle Ages. It examined the ways in which the legends explained the monasteries to themselves while at the same time situating these communities in a local web of social and political relationships with other groups and institutions. It  also analyzed the supra-local aspect of the legends. These monasteries were located in an area that modern historians of medieval France have often seen as part of the political periphery. Yet in their legends, these communities created a vibrant image of the political center, the king. In this book, Remensnyder therefore challenged the prevailing tendency of most studies of medieval kingship: to examine how the political center elaborates images of itself which it then communicates to the political periphery it wishes to dominate. Remensnyder argued that scholars instead must realize that the representations fashioned by the so-called periphery can be as creative of the political, symbolic center as is that center of itself."

S"My current research activities are in the areas of rehabilitation of combat wounded, rehabilitation outcomes measurement, and rehabilitation health services delivery.  Highlights of my work are presented below.<br /><br />Rehabilitation of Combat Wounded: Revolutionizing Prosthetics<br />My background in rehabilitation outcomes measurement, and my affiliation with the Center for Restorative and Regenerative Medicine led me to become Principal Investigator of a VA RR&D funded study on a new advanced prosthetic upper limb, called the DEKA arm. The DEKA arm was developed through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Revolutionizing Prosthetics Program. After an initial planning grant, I launched a preliminary study of the DEKA arm at the NY VA which will soon be followed by a multisite study involving up to 50 upper limb amputees. The purpose of these studies is to optimize the DEKA arm to ready it for commercial production and distribution. This research synthesizes my clinical rehabilitation background, experience in outcome measurement development, and skills in both qualitative and quantitative data analyses. <br />.<br />Rehabilitation Outcomes Measurement<br />My measurement testing, development, and refinement work has been greatly informed by the WHO's International Classification of Health and Functioning (ICF). A number of my endeavors have involved mapping outcomes tools to the ICF. Recently I've developed a measure of participation for injured service members, called the Community Reintegration of Injured Service Members (CRIS). I am in the process of testing my new measure at Brooke Army Medical Center and developing the measure into a computer adaptive test called the CRIS-CAT . Use of the CRIS-CAT will provide a method for comprehensive assessment and monitoring of community reintegration outcomes within the VA and Department of Defense (DOD). <br /><br />My current efforts to refine risk adjustment models for outpatient rehabilitation use a new index of functional co-morbidity to predict patient physical function outcomes. This project is particularly timely given the interest at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in implementing alternative payment systems for outpatient rehabilitation. <br /><br />My study titled, Identifying Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Lower Limb Amputees involves testing both physical performance and self-report measures of physical function and prosthetic satisfaction. The results of this study will be used to drive collection within the VA system of amputee care. One of my long term goals is to promote the collection of rehabilitation-relevant data within the VA electronic medical record, which in turn will enable expansion of my rehabilitation related health services research agenda within the VA.<br /><br />Rehabilitation Service Delivery<br />My research has explored factors related to clinical outcomes in outpatient therapy. My early research identified expert therapists based upon their patient outcomes, and used this sample to explore the theory of expertise in physical therapy. My research on clinical outcomes has since progressed from inquiries at the therapist level to inquiries at the clinic and state regulatory levels. My study of state regulations examined the relationships between physical therapy regulatory policy, outcomes and service utilization. My study of providers of outpatient rehabilitation services explored the relationship between clinic characteristics, patient outcomes and service utilization. <br /><br />Another of my major interest areas is the use of assistive technologies and home modifications. My research has explored the relationship between home modifications and use of personal assistance, the relationship between race and ethnicity and use of mobility aids, and the relationship between obesity and personal care for people with mobility impairments. My study on culture and mobility examined the relationship between environmental and personal factors and the use of mobility equipment."

S"Much of my work focuses on the microbial aspects of the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is a key limiting nutrient in ecosystems, and human activities have substantially increased inputs of biologically available nitrogen, leading to profound environmental changes. I am currently investigating anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), a newly discovered pathway in the nitrogen cycle, and denitrification. Both pathways lead to the loss of biologically available nitrogen in estuarine and marine environments. I have quantified rates of these processes in the Chesapeake Bay, Eastern Tropical South Pacific (Peru) and Arabian Sea. It's clear from the these studies that either anammox or denitrification can be the dominant process, but it is not clear why. We are currently working with modelers to design experiments and develop predictive models of nitrogen flow through anammox and denitrification. We are measuring anammox and denitrification rates in coastal New England in order to document controls on nitrogen flow. We are also applying molecular techniques to quantify the diversity and abundance of anammox bacteria in marine environments, in order to gain insight into how systems are functioning."

S"Theophilus Lindsey, William Frend, Augustus De Morgan, and Sophia De Morgan were all major figures in English history. Theophilus Lindsey is known as the first person to set up an openly Unitarian church in England; William Frend is known as a Georgian radical, who was banished from Cambridge in 1793; Augustus De Morgan is known as a brilliant mathematician and logician who was the first mathematics professor at the University of London; Sophia De Morgan is known as one of the first English spiritualists. I am writing an intellectual biography of several generations of an English family that includes all of these figures.<br /><br />Naming the family that included these characters is difficult because its greatest continuity lay in a matrilineal line. Theophilus Lindsey, entered it when he married Hannah Elsworth, who was the step-daughter of his dear friend and mentor, Francis Blackburne. Hannah and Theophilus had no children, but William Frend was their prot&#233;g&#233;, who forged a family connection when he married Hannah's niece, Sarah Blackburne. Augustus De Morgan entered the family when he married William's and Sarah's eldest daughter, Sophia Frend. The name that would most firmly tie together Hannah and Theophilus Lindsey, William and Sarah Frend, and Augustus and Sophia De Morgan would be neither Lindsey nor Frend nor De Morgan, but rather Blackburne. Focusing on this family is a first step toward restoring some measure of recognition to the women who carried this name, and the set of relationships that united and sustained their men.    <br /><br />The members of this family were intellectually bound by a common commitment to a view of reason rooted in the philosophy of John Locke. Over the decades that separated Lindsey from De Morgan, Lockean reason moved from the reasoned theology of eighteenth-century Unitarians to the reasoned mathematics of the nineteenth. The shift was more a shift in the center of gravity than a radical change; there was much that was mathematical in Lindsey's and Frend's theology, much that was theological in De Morgan's mathematics, and much that was both religious and reasoned in Sophia's spiritualism. That human beings were essentially defined by their reason was a constant that tied all of these people together, but the terms of expression of that position changed considerably. <br /><br />Among the members of this family, reason acted as an ideal as well as an idea; its implications were as much practical as they were intellectual. Both Lindsey and Frend saw their conclusion that Jesus was a human being to be the necessary outcome of a reasoned reading of the Bible, but their reasoning did not stop at this doctrinal level. Their insight about the humanity of Jesus led them immediately to the recognition that Jesus's life was a human model to be emulated. In this way, a commitment to reason in religion led seamlessly to a commitment to radical action. Many other Anglicans&#151;including the nominal patriarch of this family, Francis Blackburne&#151;saw clearly that there were problems with the details of church doctrine, but they saw no need to leave the church. Lindsey's understanding of reasoned Unitarianism required him to act. <br /><br />All of the members of the family were committed to radical dissent. Theophilus Lindsey sacrificed a comfortable position in the Anglican church when he formed a Unitarian one. William Frend was unemployable for 15 years after he was expelled from Cambridge for his religious and political views. Augustus De Morgan took his place among the family's martyrs to conscience when he resigned his position at University College London (UCL) over a disagreement about the place of religion there. All of the women passionately defended their husbands, even as they struggled to adjust to the economic and social fall-outs of these stands. <br /><br />The same God that held Lindsey accountable for the doctrines of his church held him accountable for bringing out the reason of the people around him. Education was a central duty for all members of the family, male and female, young and old. Theophilus and Hannah Lindsey created a Sunday School dedicated to teaching the poor of their parish; William Frend was similarly involved with teaching the poor in Cambridge; Sarah Frend and Sophia De Morgan taught their children at home; Augustus De Morgan taught other people's children at UCL, and all of them wrote textbooks of one form or another. They were constantly looking for ways to set loose the power of reason by supporting mechanics institutes, volunteering in schools, serving on the boards of struggling colleges. <br /><br />These traditions were relatively stable, but the circumstances of their expression changed considerably between the mid-eighteenth century, when Lindsey left the Anglican church and the mid-nineteenth century when the Augustus and Sophia De Morgan were in their primes. A family history is the best way to understand the human experience of these massive changes. Like biography, a family history cuts across the boundaries of public and private, but in a way that differently balances individual and tradition. Individuals play an important role, but their individuality is always enmeshed with others and attenuated by the flow of time. A family history offers enough breadth to explore the variety of ways that ideas become ideals that shape the lives of the men and women who hold them."

S'Professor Richardson has biomedical engineering research interests with five main themes: adhesion, aggregation and disintegration of cells and cell groups, with applications in thrombosis and hemostasis artificial organs, especially those designed for transport purposes such as artificial lungs and hybrid artificial pancreases applications of ultrasound in detection and diagnosis, including intravascular usage, and corresponding image analysis interaction of flow and blood vessel walls, especially for problems associated with atherosclerosis design of devices and instruments with biomedical applications (where his research has led to patents). One current project illustrating a combination of the third and fourth themes is a study of the left anterior descending epicardial arteries in pigs which have been fed atherogenic diets, making comparisons between video-rate intravascular ultrasound images at various mean blood pressures (using image-analysis software custom-written at Brown), mechanical measurements of tissue obtained immediately at post-mortem, and histology of the vessel sections, with relevance to improvement of coronary angioplasty. Another current project involves computer-modeling of flow of thousands of blood platelets as they join a developing thrombus, under various conditions of flow, and incorporating time-varying physiological responses of the individual platelets. Professor Richardson also has engineering research interests which are not primarily biomedical, these having two main themes: (a) effects of oscillations, pulsations, sound and vibrations on flow fields, and corresponding heat and mass transfer (b) flows at branches of tubes and ducts, including cases where the flows are oscillatory or pulsatile'

S'Aerogel Chemistry<br /><br />Aerogels that combine the chemistries of silica and bio-derived polymers, such as chitosan have been synthesized in our group and are under study with a number of chemical approaches. In one key direction, we have shown that molecules can be transported through the aerogel structure and react selectively at chitosan sites to provide attached species. These attachments functionalize the aerogels for further interactions with light, with functional fluids, and with surfaces. Further, metal-containing ions can be attached to coordination sites of the chitosan, and they can respond to light, to reactive gaseous species and to absorbed liquids.<br /><br />Bioinorganic Polymers<br /><br />Certain naturally derived polymers can coordinate to transition metal ions to form structures which result in modifying the physical state, as through gelation, or the chemical reactivity, especially by coordinative chemistry or oxidative degradation, of these polymers or ions. Studies with chitosan, carrageenan, and related systems are underway. Our current focus is on the formation of biopolymer / silica areogels containing transition metal and lanthanide metal ions. The biopolymer serves both to help to form the hybrid composite structure and to provide functional coordination sites for the metal ions. The catalytic and optical properties of these novel high surface area materials are under study.<br /><br />Chemical and Physical Properties of Ionomers<br /><br />Ionomers are polymers with ionic sites that have been reacted with counterions. They can serve as supported metal catalysts. Research is designed to isolate metal ions in ionomer-based supports, and react them with small molecules to form model chemisorption species. Current research in this program concerns the formation of novel optical materials in which lanthanide species are incorporated in organic ionomer structures or in new types of siloxanes or germanosiloxane ionomers. This work includes the synthesis and characterization of the host inorganic polymers, their photocrosslinking reactions, and their conversion to glass structures. These glass structures are designed for planar waveguide, microlens, and other applications in optical computing or communications.<br /><br />Polyurethane Ionomer Chemistry<br /><br />Ionomer chemistry has long interested our group, and a particular focus is on polyurethane ionomers. We have developed a new synthetic method that leads to ionomers with significantly different properties than those attained by earlier methods. Thus, for example, the materials can be stronger and have the temperature dependence of their mechanical moduli be minimized due to the molecular structures achieved by this method. The temperature dependences of the moduli of a zinc polyurethane ionomer ( Zn-PUI ) made by the new method and of one with same composition made by the old method are compared. The nature of the molecular structures and the nanoscale morphology that lead to this difference are under study. In this work, it also has been discovered that these ionomers promote molecular-level blending of various types of ionomers, including ethylene-methacrylic acid ionomers. The controlled introduction of metal ions by this method makes it possible to investigate the reaction chemistry of transition metal-PUI systems, and this work is underway.<br /><br />Ionomers in Fuel Cells<br /><br />Ionomers such as Nafions, members of a class of perfluorosulfonic acid materials made by Du Pont, are used in low temperature fuel cells. They act as proton-transporting membranes, and they are involved with catalysts and electrodes in the dissociation and electrochemistry of the oxidant ( O2 ) and fuel ( e.g. H2 ). In our laboratory, work on the chemical composition of the near-surface region of ionomer membranes has lead to discovery of electrochemical means to modify the surface morphology of the membrane and a metal coated catalytic region. It also has lead to discovery of metal-containing dendritic structures inside the surface of a membrane, and this opens a new approach to fuel cell development.<br /><br />Inorganic Glasses<br /><br />Amorphous inorganic materials exhibit properties with many potential applications, ranging from optical communications to ion-transport in electrochemical systems and metallic waste storage, but many traditional methods for studying bonding and structures cannot be used on them. Moreover, the intervention of stable crystalline phases and other thermodynamic phenomena sometimes makes it impossible to prepare glasses with compositions required for these applications. Synthetic and spectroscopic methods are needed to form and characterize new materials, and these are being studied using sol-gel approaches. As they are formed the materials evolve through long-lived metastable states, whose properties and transitions are being studied thermally and spectroscopically. Studying the way ions move in glasses, glass structures and their relationship to their crystallization, ionic conductivity, and mechanical and optical properties are investigated by infrared, laser Raman, and theoretical techniques.'

S'Some of the questions I address in my research: do digital media promote a new type of "encyclopedic" learning, based on learning communities sharing common cognitive "values"? Or do they foster, instead, new forms of fragmentary knowledge, thinking and "values"? How can electronic media enhance our historical understanding of texts, images (and other cultural products) belonging to a distant cultural past? More specifically: how can classic literary and philosophical works of the Italian humanist tradition, as diverse as Boccaccio\'s <i>Decameron</i> (the narrative epic of early Modern mercantile world), Pico\'s Oration <i>On Human Dignity</i> (a "manifesto" of Renaissance philosophy) or Calvino\'s "hypernovels" (the expression of a cybernetic society) suggest new modes of thought for 21st-century humanism? I see the main challenge of my work as translating into critical discourse the new cognitive values emerging from my experimentation with digital technology, for the benefit of scholars, teachers and students engaged in these practices, as well as all those readers interested in the future (the present) of the humanities.'

S"Adolescents and young adults in the U.S. are becoming a more ethnically and racially diverse group than ever before. To better understand what this augurs for the U.S. populace, there is a need to better understand the role of race and ethnicity in the experiences, relationships, and contexts of diverse youths. As such, my research follows two distinct but interrelated lines of inquiry into (i) the socialization and internalization of ethnic beliefs and values and (ii) the negotiation of societal and institutional pathways to upward social mobility among ethnic minority youth. My work has been published in journals such as Developmental Psychology, Journal of Research on Adolescence, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, American Journal of Community Psychology, and Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology.<br /><br />Ethnic and Racial Identity Development. I am interested in the ways in which parents' efforts to socialize their children around issues of ethnicity and race (i.e., ethnic-racial socialization) intersect with youths' own experiences outside the family context&#151;such as when they experience discrimination in school&#151;to influence the development and content of ethnic and racial identities. My work also examines the extent to which ethnic identity can buffer youth from the pernicious consequences of discrimination on academic and psychological outcomes. <br /><br />Perceived Barriers and Opportunities for Upward Mobility. I am interested in how ethnic minority youth perceive and experience various forms of social exclusion and barriers, such as perceived job ceilings, that become increasingly salient as they move from adolescence to young adulthood.<br /><br />Conceptual and Methodological Perspectives. All of my work draws from developmental perspectives that attend to cultural and ecological/contextual factors; examines variation in processes both within and across ethnic/racial groups, including Latino, Black, Asian, and White youth; and variously employs quantitative, qualitative, and longitudinal methodologies, including SEM, HLM/MLM, cluster analysis, and Latent Class Analysis approaches.

His B.A. was in Biology (with research in tropical and temperate ecology) from Kenyon College.<br /><br />Co-author and editor of eight books and over sixty articles and book chapters, Timmons\' current research focuses on climate change and international devleopment.  It has three threads: 1. How shifting relations between the global North and South affect the United Nations negotiations on climate change; 2. The role of foreign aid in the negotiations and in assisting developing countries cope with climate impacts and greening their economies; and 3. What social factors explain national "pathways" (being relatively high or low carbon emitters for their level of human development).  In all three the core focus is on how equity affects our ability to address this complex global problem. <br /><br />A co-founder of AidData.org, Timmons is part of an international effort to produce a quantum leap in transparency in climate finance, and foreign aid more broadly.  His Climate and Development Lab at Brown provides research support to the Least Developed Countries Group (the world\'s 49 poorest nations) in the U.N. negotiations.  He is a leader in Rhode Island\'s efforts to plan for how to adapt to climate changes, serving on the RI Climate Change Commission, created in 2010 by legislation written by him and his Brown students.  Professor Roberts has worked for many years with students on greening initiatives and with community groups and local, state and national governments. He teaches environmental sociology, globalization and the environment, and practicum group workshop courses on environmental policy issues. Most recently, he was appointed to the Board on Environmental Change and Society of the National Academy of Sciences.'

S"Research in my lab is aimed at understanding the physiological bases for locomotor performance in vertebrates.  Many features of locomotor behavior have yet to be explained from physiological principles because our understanding of the integrated function of the musculoskeletal system is limited.  Two current areas of interest in my lab explore this integrated function.  First, can the patterns of metabolic energy demand with running speed and across animal size be explained from principles of muscle physiology?  We are combining studies of the mechanical function of muscles during running with physiological studies of muscle metabolism to try to understand the physiological basis of locomotor cost.  Second, what sets the limit to acceleration performance in terrestrial animals?  We currently use frog jumping as a model for understanding the relationship between the mechanical properties of muscles and tendons and an animal's ability to rapidly accelerate.  <br /><br />Students in my lab use a variety of approaches and techniques, from the application of standard tools of biomechanics (high-speed video, force plates) to isolated muscle contractile property measurements, to computer-based dynamic simulations.  We are opportunistic in our choice of study organisms.  Currently wild turkeys are important study animals for our work on running, and we use several species of frogs to study acceleration.<br /><br />The motivation behind my research is two-fold.  As an evolutionary biologist, I am interested in understanding how muscle and tendon properties have shaped the evolution of animal size and form.  As a physiologist, I am eager to use the power of a comparative approach to provide a fundamental understanding of musculoskeletal function that can ultimately be applied to problems of human health."

S'My research uses the tools of biomechanics and functional morphology to study how animals move. Among vertebrates, the mechanical behavior of muscles, tendons, and bones is quite conserved at the tissue and cellular levels. The diversity of locomotor performance results in large part from the arrangement and interaction of these components.  I investigate the integrated function of muscles, tendons, and skeletal lever systems to better understand the evolution of musculoskeletal design.'

S'Trained broadly as an early Americanist, I am interested in three historical trajectories that converged in the late-eighteenth century: the emergence of capitalism in the Atlantic World, the rise of New World Slavery, and the articulation of liberal conceptions of human agency and personal freedom. Integrating economic, labor, and cultural history, my work explores the social experience of economic change in the decades surrounding the American Revolution. In 2003, I published  <i>Welfare Reform in the Early Republic: A Brief History with Documents</i> with Bedford Books. <i>Scraping By: Wage Labor, Slavery, and Survival in Early Baltimore</i> came out in 2009  from Johns Hopkins University Press. <br /><br />About <i>Scraping By</i>: Imagine Barbara Ehrenreich\'s <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, circa 1818&#151; that is, a very material look at how low-end workers found and kept jobs, navigated underground economies, employed clever strategies to keep households afloat, and what happened when they failed. <i>Scraping By</i> situates enslaved mariners, white seamstresses, Irish dockhands, free black domestic servants, and native-born street-sweepers in the same labor market, on the same jobsites, and ultimately within the same political economy of early republic capitalism. As a "labor history of unskilled labor" and one of the first studies to consider such diverse workers side-by-side, <i>Scraping By</i> explores how race, sex, nativity, and legal status determined the opportunities and vulnerabilities of working families. This study focuses on Baltimore between 1790 and 1840, when this boomtown was the nation\'s third-largest city, had the nation\'s largest population of color, and (perched at the boundary of North and South) saw its number of free and enslaved workers grow simultaneously. Sources include construction site payrolls, employment advertisements, almshouse records, court petitions, and speeches from the nation\'s first "living wage" campaign.<br /><br /><i>Scraping By</i> is fundamentally a study of capitalism and class in the post-Revolutionary US. In advance of the book, I have published several stand-alone essays on 1) integrating slavery into histories of capitalism, and 2) the viability of class analysis for the early republic United States. This work suggests that at a time when issues of globalization, free trade, corporate accounting, and fair labor practices dominate the headlines, economic history is too important to be left to traditional economic historians. Eschewing social-scientific models of human behavior and market mechanisms, I propose a history of American capitalism that recognizes the cultural and social forces that constitute "the market" and shape a multiplicity of human responses to economic stimuli. <br /><br />My new book project-- under contract with University of Chicago Press-- focuses on objects manufactured in the North for use on plantations in the American South. At the intersection of business history and material culture studies, I consider the multiple meanings of hoes, blankets, and machetes as they moved great distances and fell into different hands. These artifacts illuminate issues of slave resistance, abolitionism, business ethics, technological innovation, and Southern nationalism, while also situating entrepreneurs, factory laborers, planters, and slaves in the same narrative of economic development. By following "plantation goods" from production to consumption, it is possible to see the simultaneity of opportunity and oppression in American history.<br /><br />In April 2011, Sven Beckert (Harvard) and I convened a three-day conference entitled "Slavery\'s Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development." After a keynote address by President Ruth Simmons, seventeen scholars presented new research and engaged in vigorous discussion with commentators and the audience. Revised versions of these essays are now being prepared for publication in a volume to appear in the Early American Studies series at University of Pennsylvania Press.'

Chicana/o novels register crucial new discourses of identity, politics, and cultural citizenship that cannot be understood apart from the historical instability following the demise of the nationalist politics of the Chicana/o movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In contrast to that time, when Chicanas/os sought a unified Chicano identity in order to effect social change, the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s have seen a disengagement from these nationalist politics and a new trend toward a heterogeneous sense of self. The detective novel and its traditional focus on questions of knowledge and identity turned out to be the perfect medium in which to examine this new self.<br /><br />Both of my current critical books projects and my recent critical essays demonstrate a continued interest in aesthetics, textual politcs, and literary form.'

S"Overview of Current Research Projects<br />Damaris J. Rohsenow, Ph.D.<br />(10/5/2011)<br /><br />&#9;My research program has focused on social learning theory oriented approaches to the etiology and treatment of alcoholism, cocaine abuse and smoking, on the development of behavioral and pharmacologic treatment approaches, and on determinants and effects of nonalcoholic drinking.<br />&#9;Smoking interventions.  Because alcoholics smoke at an exceptionally high rate and are resistant to quitting, I conducted a series of studies investigating the role of smoking in risk for relapse for alcoholics.  I completed a smoking treatment trial for alcoholics in state funded alcohol treatment in which brief motivational intervention was compared to brief advice to quit smoking, started in their first two weeks of treatment.  A second treatment trial for substance abusers in an inner-city residential substance abuse treatment program compared motivational interviewing to brief advice to quit smoking (three sessions of each) crossed with contingent monetary rewards for providing breath samples showing abstinence from smoking as compared to a control procedure.  Several pilot studies then compared variants of the contingency management procedure to select the next step.  Currently I have two studies with drug dependent smokers: one comparing contingency management to a control procedure when added to nicotine patch and counseling, and the other investigating the benefits of varenicline vs. patch.  Postdoctoral fellows have added measures to these studies.<br />&#9;Laboratory investigations of medications for smoking. (Funded by VA Merit Review.)  I have been using laboratory procedures to investigate promising new medication approaches for smoking cessation. <br />   1) A pilot study that showed that naltrexone combined with nicotine replacement significantly reduced smoking cue-elicited urge to smoke and withdrawal relative to nicotine replacement alone.  <br />  2) A larger trial of naltrexone (50 mg. vs. placebo) and nicotine replacement (0, 21 mg, 42 mg) showed little beneficial effect of combining naltrexone with transdermal nicotine overall, and showed that transdermal nicotine only reduces urges to smoke at the 42 mg dose, not the usually recommended 21 mg dose.<br />  3)  A third trial found significant effects of a dopamine antagonist (olanzapine) on smoking urge and withdrawal at the low dose (2.5 mg) but not the high dose (5.0 mg).  <br />  4) The recently completed project investigated baclofen, a GABAergic medication, for effects on urge, withdrawal, and reinforcement from smoking. <br />&#9;Laboratory investigations of medications for alcoholism. 1)  I completed two studies that a single dose or two weeks of dosing with naltrexone significantly reduced urge to drink and self-reported attention to the cues in the presence of alcohol cues, but not in response to juice or water cues, indicating that naltrexone's effect is not mediated by effects on appetite in general.  2) I recently completed a pair of laboratory studies of high doses naltrexone crossed with ondansetron for effects on reactions of alcoholics to the presence of alcohol cues and of the subjective effects of drinking alcohol by problem drinkers who have not sought treatment.  (Funded by NIAAA.)  These laboratory investigations provide a cost-efficient way to provide preliminary evidence for or against new pharmacologic agents, and to investigate hypothesized mediating mechanisms of effect. <br />&#9;Cocaine treatment and assessment studies.  With cocaine abusers, I developed a coping skills training package that resulted in significantly fewer cocaine use days during the first 6 months of follow up.  I conducted another treatment trial in which motivational enhancement procedures were added to the coping skills training to determine the increased effectiveness of the combined approaches.  Third, I completed a study to investigate the extent to which urges to use cocaine predict cocaine use during follow up in a multivariate analysis including other pretreatment predictors.  This study also compared the relative effectiveness and predictive power of various different methods of assessing urge to use cocaine during treatment and the effectiveness of various coping strategies.  In this program of research, numerous new assessment instruments have been developed psychometrically and have been published.  The skills treatment was selected by NIDA for their library of evidence-based treatments. Considerable data are still to be mined and analyzed.<br />&#9;Alcohol treatment trials.  I conducted several treatment studies with alcoholics. 1)  Cue exposure treatment and communication skills training resulted in lower relapse rates and longer latency to the first drink than did any other combination of treatments. 2)  We combined the cue exposure and communication skills training package with naltrexone versus placebo and evaluated the effects on treatment outcome.  Naltrexone reduced drinking quantity only during the 12 weeks of medication, and only among those who took at least 70% of the medication.  The behavioral treatment resulted in significantly less drinking that the control group during both the 6 and 12 month follow ups, showing lasting beneficial effects at low cost (5 sessions). 3) Secondary analyses demonstrated predictors of treatment compliance and that medication effects were limited to people with high density of family history or who were more psychopathic.  Certain urge-specific coping skills during follow-up were associated with better outcomes, and others were ineffective. 4) We completed a trial of naltrexone with heavy drinkers who had not sought treatment and who carry palm-top computers to record data in the natural environment and now are investigating topiramate the same way. (PI: Monti, Co-PI: Rohsenow.) <br />&#9;Effects of low-dose alcohol and hangover on commercial ship handling. (PI: Howland, Co-PI: Rohsenow.) 1) In two studies, we showed that a low dose of alcohol (.04 gm% blood alcohol level) significantly impairs the performance of experienced ship engineer cadets and ship pilot cadets on commercial ship simulators.  This has implications for policy, and raises the question as to whether even lower doses are unsafe.  2) We completed a study of very low doses of alcohol for effects on power plant simulators.  Data analysis is underway. 3) We have completed two studies of the effects of drinking to .10-.12 g% on next morning ship simulator performance.  In one, we found no impaired performance on ship power plant performance although people rated themselves as more hung over and impaired.  We developed and validated a new Acute Hangover Scale using this work. In the study using experienced pilots and a bridge simulator, we are finding impaired performance after a night of drinking to 0.10 gm% on serious events (running aground) but no effect on routine activities (steering, reporting).  4) Another study investigated hangover effects on sleep and academic performance in college student, while varying congener content of beverages.  Congener effects were found only on subjective hangover symptoms. Alcohol impaired reaction time and sleep (studied with polysomnography) but sleep effects did not mediate effects on performance.  5) A seasickness medication was found not to impair maritime cadet performance on ship simulators.  6) Our last study  showed that caffeinated beer does not improve performance in driving while at .12 g% or the next morning compared to usual beer and to placebo beer."

S"Ultrafast chemical dynamics: <br />A fundamental goal of chemical research has always been to understand the reaction mechanisms leading to specific reaction products. Reaction mechanisms, in turn, are a consequence of the structural dynamics of molecules participating in the chemical process with atomic motions occurring on the ultrafast timescale of femtoseconds (10^-15 s) and picoseconds (10^-12 s). Since these ultrafast motions are the essence of every chemical process, detailed knowledge about their nature is of fundamental importance. Consequently, theoretical modeling and experimental measurement of these ultrafast structural dynamics is of fundamental importance to chemistry and it is our primary area of research. <br />We use ultrafast x-ray absorption fine structure (UXAFS) measurements of the atomic motions of solvated organometallic complexes during photo-induced ligand substitution reactions. These measurements are accompanied by ultrafast UV transient absorption (UVTA) experiments that measure the reactions times of various reaction paths suggested by our theoretical studies. The UXAFS experiments are carried out in my laboratory using a laser-driven plasma x-ray source as well as at ID7-C at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) and at BL6.0.1.2 at the Advance Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). The UVTA experiments are carried out in my laboratory.<br /><br />Ultrafast physical dynamics:<br />The laser-driven plasma x-ray source is used additionally for ultrafast x-ray holographic imaging of picosecond ultrasonic wave packets propagating in the bulk of optically opaque materials. The imaging method relies on x-ray phase contrast imaging, introduced in the next section, and not on x-ray diffraction. The sample material's crystal structure is irrelevant for the imaging process and in the future, materials not accessible to x-ray diffraction will be the major application area. <br /><br />Bio-medical imaging:<br />A phase-sensitive x-ray imaging method is applied to biological tissues. This phase-contrast x-ray imaging is fundamentally different from conventional x-ray radiography because the mechanism of image formation does not rely on differential absorption by tissues. Instead, x-ray beams undergo differential phase shifts in passing through an organ and subsequently interfere constructively or destructively at the x-ray camera or film. Hence, tissues are distinguished by their different indices of refraction rather than their absorptive properties. This imaging method is more than a thousand times more sensitive to density variations of tissues than conventional absorption methods and enables imaging of soft tissues with high contrast without the use of contrast agents. We currently apply this modality to the imaging of the micro vascularization of healthy and cancerous murine livers.<br /><br />Furthermore, our research focuses on the development of an x-ray imaging modality that combines ultrasound-induced motions in tissue with the detection of such motions by phase contrast x-ray imaging. The goal of the research is to lay the foundation for providing, in a single high resolution, high contrast x-ray image, a delineation of differences in tissue elastic properties. The method combines tissue specificity typically exploited in palpation, elastography, and ultrasound imaging, with the high contrast and high resolution of x-ray phase contrast imaging. As a consequence, the modality not just encodes tissue density but also tissue elasticity into the same high-resolution x-ray image, yielding remote palpation with high spatial resolution. The combined information in the x-ray image should greatly aid the detection and characterization of suspicious lesions even in complicated imaging situations such as radiologically dense breast tissue. The image size is only dependent on the size of the x-ray image detector and therefore can be as large as with conventional film systems. Much of this work is carried out in collaboration with Prof. G. Diebold, Dept. of Chemistry, and Prof. J. R. Wands, Alpert Medical School."

Her earlier work has included health values' protective role in adolescent sexual decision-making and the development and evaluation of theory-driven risk reduction interventions. Her current research examines the factors that influence sexual behavior within different types of sexual partnerships and assesses these associations separately for adolescent boys and girls. Her ultimate goal is to develop interventions that will decrease the incidence of STDs and unplanned pregnancies in adolescents and young adults. Through her program of research, she plans to develop sexual risk reduction interventions that will include important attitudes, values, and expectancies found to influence partner-specific sexual decision-making in adolescents. Future research on a broader range of influential factors (i.e., family, peer, community, and culture) and additional emphasis on the development of targeted risk prevention interventions (e.g., targeting sexually inexperienced adolescents) are a part of her long-term plan of research."

S'Endothelial cell apoptosis is an important means of regulating angiogenesis and may play a role in the pathogenesis of diseases involving the alveolar capillary septum. Anoikis is apoptosis due to disruption of focal adhesions between anchorage-dependent cells and adjacent substratum.  Small GTPases modulate multiple cell functions.  Small GTPases possess a C-terminal CAAX motif and undergo post-translational processing, culminating in carboxyl methylation of the C-terminal cysteine by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT).   While much is known about phosphorylation as a means of post-translational protein processing, less is known about methylation. We have shown that adenosine and homocysteine (Ado/HC) decrease RhoA and Ras methylation and activation and cause endothelial apoptosis through a mechanism involving increased intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).  These effects are prevented by over-expression of ICMT, suggesting that Ado/HC act by inhibiting ICMT-induced GTPase methylation.  We have also demonstrated that adenosine plus homocysteine causes disruption of Focal Adhesion Complexes (FAC), followed by caspase-induced proteolysis of protein components of FAC.  We therefore hypothesize that inhibition of carboxyl methylation of small GTPases causes disruption of FAC, caspase activation, proteolysis of FAC protein components, and anoikis.  Preliminary Results indicate that ICMT inhibition changes expression and charge of GRP94, a chaperone protein that is important in the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR).  Since malfunction of the UPR and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response causes apoptosis, we hypothesize that decreased ICMT activity and resulting decreased Ras or RhoA activity alter GRP94 function, resulting in apoptosis due to malfunction of the UPR.  Thus, we hypothesize that ICMT activity controls a multitude of functions and disruption of this activity promotes endothelial cell apoptosis via anoikis and/or via dysfunctional UPR.<br /><br />1.&#9;We will determine the effects of ICMT inhibition on FAC formation and anoikis.<br />a. We will determine the effects of inhibitors of ICMT on methylation, localization, and activation of Ras and RhoA GTPase and on apoptosis using cultured pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. <br />b. We will determine the role of Ras and RhoA GTPases in endothelial anoikis caused by ICMT inhibition by comparing the effects of over-expression of Ras or RhoA GTPase and downstream signaling molecules on FAC disruption and apoptosis caused by ICMT inhibition.  <br />c. We will determine the effects of ICMT inhibition on pulmonary vascular endothelial apoptosis in vivo.<br /><br />2.&#9;We will determine the effect of ICMT inhibition on GRP94 and the role of the ER Stress Response in endothelial cell apoptosis caused by ICMT inhibition. <br />a.  We will determine the effects of ICMT inhibition on GRP94 expression, post-translational processing, and sub-cellular localization.  <br />b.  We will determine the role of decreased small GTPase activity by assessing effects of Ras and RhoA over-expression on ICMT-induced changes in GRP94 expression, post-translational processing, and sub-cellular localization.<br />c.  We will determine the effects of ICMT inhibition on markers of the UPR/ER Stress Response.<br />d.&#9;We will determine the effects of Ras and/or RhoA over-expression on the UPR/ER Stress Response.<br />e.&#9;We will determine the effects of GRP94 over-expression on caspase activation, FAC disruption, proteolysis of FAC components, and anoikis induced by inhibition of ICMT.<br /><br />The work proposed in this application will ascertain the mechanism of GTPase methylation and the role of GRP94 in regulation of endothelial cell apoptosis.  Furthermore, in vivo experiments will determine whether currently released drugs cause endothelial apoptosis.  This has potential importance in treatment of lung diseases in which there is abnormal endothelial cell proliferation.<br /><br />Another major area of research is to assess the effects of carboxylmethylation of RhoA GTPase on endothelial monolayer and pulmonary microvascular permeability.'

S'In the 1980s, I co-directed the excavation of a 17th-century Narragansett Indian burial ground in Rhode Island accidentally discovered during construction. My involvement developed into a long-term research commitment and collaborative partnership with the Narragansett Indians focused on interpreting the material record to illuminate the lived experiences of a Native people in ways that would challenge "common knowledge." The interpretive approach emphasized how material culture, both "Native" and "European," expressed identities that neither reflected acculturation, nor social hierarchies among the burials; but instead, represented the intersections of several dimensions of difference. The research used the holistic methods of historical anthropology to combine the archaeology with archival data and oral histories to construct a many-sided and more comprehensive, account of colonial experiences.<br /><br />In the 1990s, I initiated an archaeological project at the site of Cocumscussoc aimed at examining a European frontier settlement and trading post located in Narragansett Indian Country, just a short distance from the burial ground. The research explored multi-ethnic archaeological history of the site, which was occupied by European colonists (and European Americans), African slaves, and Native Americans, and related changes in its cultural landscapes before, during, and after the 17th century. The archaeological materials from the site, which are curated at Brown through an agreement with the Cocumscussoc Association, serve as a study collection for students for learning skills in historic artifact identification and interpretation.<br /><br />I am currently doing research on Native American monuments in New England that explores how memorials create, sustain, and erase history and cultural identity. The research uses a landscape and diachronic approach that situates public monuments in contexts of long-term and on-going histories of place and memorialization.'

This continues research done in connection with the research group at the Watson Institute on "Effective and Defectrive States," which resulted in an edited volume "States and Development: Historical Antecedents of Stagnation and Advance," edited by Matthew Lange and Dietrich Rueschemeyer, New York and London: Palgrave/Macmillan 2005. Continuation of this research also feeds into the book on social and political theory listed below.<br />2. I am writing a book on "Usable Theory: Analytic Tools for Social and Political Research," under contract with Princeton University Press. Focusing on theoretical tools of use in actual research, this monograph also addresses open questions in the methodology of theoretically oriented research, especially the question why social and political research has uncovered fewer substantial theoretical results than expected. As the first half of the book, which deals with micro-structures and -processes, is virtually completed, current and future work focuses on macro-issues such as those studied in comparative politics and political economy.'

S'Historical linguistics traces related ("sister") languages back to a common ancestor and then explains the differentiation of the sisters in terms of linguistic changes that must be justified as simple and plausible, typically by reference to similar changes in other languages.  My current research attempts to establish historical metrics as a parallel field that draws on historical linguistics and repays the debt with insight into natural-language developments of a kind that deliberate language, as opposed to spontaneous language, can provide.  I work on English, the language whose history has been perhaps most thoroughly studied by linguists.  English offers a rich archive of texts going back to the 7th century and its earliest verse form, the alliterative meter used in poems like <i> Beowulf</i>, is clearly descended from an ancestral Germanic meter also inherited by the sister Germanic linguistic and literary cultures:  Old Norse, Old Saxon, and Old High German.  Alliterative meter arises naturally from the structure of early Germanic, forming the basis for a preliterate tradition of oral-formulaic composition.  It can be assumed unproblematically that such traditions change only when they absolutely must do so because of linguistic changes that make old metrical rules impossible to observe.  In <i> Beowulf and Old Germanic Metre</i> (Cambridge University Press 1998), I showed how the sister alliterative meters diverged in response to linguistic changes within Old Norse, Old Saxon, Old High German, and Old English.  Current publications show how the alliterative meter of Middle English poems like <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> evolved from Old English meter as a result of language changes that transformed Old English into Middle English, drawing comparative evidence from similar responses to similar changes in the later metrical and linguistic history of Norse.  Catastrophic language changes in Early Modern English are then used to explain why Middle English alliterative meter was abandoned very soon after it had been used for a variety of first-rate poetic narratives.  Finally, the advent of rhymed iambic meters in Early Modern English is explained in terms of their better "fit" with the English of this period, in the sense of "fit" that prevails in universalist approaches to metrics like those of Paul Kiparsky, Kristen Hanson, Gilbert Youmans, and Charles Li.'

S"Most of my research has been experimental: field and theoretical investigations of the phase equilibria of calc-alkaline magmas. The purpose of my research is to establish mineral stabilities and compositions in these magmas as a function of the fugacities of the volatile species(H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>,SO<sub>2</sub>, Cl etc.), temperature and the total pressure. Originally, this type of phase equilibrium study was used to assess the conditions in pre-eruption subvolcanic magma systems at Mount St. Helens, and more recently, in the pre-eruption magma system at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. An investigation of conditions in the andesite composition magmas erupted at Mount Rainier over the past 5000 years was recently completed. <br /><br />My second major research interest is the rates of volcanic processes. My group has studied the reaction of the hydrous amphibole phenocrysts with the surrounding melt in calc-alkaline magmas as they rise to the surface in attempts to determine the rates of magma ascent in different volcanic systems. The erupted rocks at Mount St. Helens show that this reaction has proceeded to different degrees in different samples, and that most samples contain amphibole populations with different ascent histories. In contrast, the eruption of dacitic magma at Black Butte near Mt. Shasta in northern CA., clearly contains magma which has not experienced any mixing either pre-eruption or during ascent. My latest use of these petrological methods for assessing magma ascent rates is illustrated in the papers on recent eruptions at Montserrat and Unzen. At Montserrat, this method was important in recognizing the changes that were taking place in the rate of magma ascent during the eruption, and in predicting a change from quiet magma effusion to more explosive activity. I am actively involved with collaborators in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) studying the new lava dome eruption of Mount St. Helens. <br /><br />I have been working closely in collaboration with a small group of international scientists to study the parameters that have controlled volcanic eruptions at the Phlegrean fields center near Naples in Italy. This center has been extremely active over the past 35,000 years, with the most recent eruption in 1800 AD. <br /><br />NASA RESEARCH:<br />Studies of magmatic processes on the moon and other terrestrial type planetary bodies continue to be carried out with NASA support. At the same time, the SNC meteorites are being investigated for evidence of magmatic and volcanic conditions on Mars. A part of this project comes from the discovery of andesite composition rocks on the surface of Mars at the Pathfinder site. My team completed a study that demonstrates how these andesite composition magmas could be related by igneous processes to the main group of SNC magmas known to erupt on Mars.<br /><br />A three-year proposal has been funded by the NASA Mars Data Analysis Program that will allow my group and its associated students to study the nature of magmatic and surface oxidation processes on Mars. Specifically, studies were defined that might explain the compositions of the Mars rocks represented by the SNC meteorites on one hand, and those deduced from spectroscopic study of rock and soil samples at the Mars Pathfinder site on the other. Additionally, I have proposed experiments which might indicate how surface oxidation and alteration of SNC basaltic rocks might alter the spectral properties of the Mars surface, and explain some of the high plagioclase to pyroxene ratios identified in the remotely sensed spectra of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. Finally, this proposal allows Mac's group to continue investigations of volcanism and the role of volatile elements in Martian volcanic processes."

S'Ryan has recently completed a book entitled <i>Thinking without Thinking in the Victorian Novel</i> that examines the pivotal role played by fiction in mid-nineteenth-century debates about the new sciences of the mind.<br /><br />My book <i>Thinking Without Thinking in the Victorian Novel</i> uncovers a Victorian pre-history of contemporary neural science largely forgotten by cognitive scientists today.  In mid to late nineteenth-century Britain some of the most eminent novelists and scientists began to look seriously at nonreasoned thought, specifically what they called "unconscious cerebration."  Not only intellectuals like George Henry Lewes and Herbert Spencer, but also novelists like Wilkie Collins and George Eliot were centrally involved in the debates over the nature of the mind and consciousness.  Victorian fiction offered sophisticated engagements with intuitive and reflexive mental processes, aspects of the psycho-physiological problem that remain central to neural science today.  Scientists and novelists alike argued that fiction, through its writing and its reading, gained special purchase on modes of cognitive experience that resisted the methods of the new psychological science.  My book argues that the centrality of fiction in these complex debates demands that we recast our understanding of "consciousness" in the Victorian novel.<br /><br />In my next project,  <i>The Invention of the Intellectual: Edwardian Fictions of Decline</i>, I offer a pre-history of the current debate over the death of the intellectual. This study uncovers the origins in the late nineteenth century and Edwardian period of our idea of the modern intellectual, and our fear at its disappearance.  Looking at authors, poets, and social critics including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy, Leslie Stephen, and Lytton Strachey, my project examines the crucial role these writers played in shaping public and literary discussions over intellectual legitimacy and cultural authority both then and now.  I consider the debates over the status of the intellectual specifically as a response to the increasing institutionalization and professionalization of science at the end of the nineteenth-century.'

S"Pain is a national health problem with over $150 billion/year in direct costs and lost productivity. Hospitalized patients with intractable pain experience increased length of stay, longer recovery time and weakened immunity. Normally the nervous system and the immune system are protective mechanisms. However, certain diseases that damage nerves such as diabetic neuropathy and viral infections, or following trauma, interaction between immune cells and neurons may lead to intractable pain that is life-threatening by itself.<br />In the laboratory, I study immune cells in the spinal cord and the brain called 'glia' to identify molecular signaling pathways that sensitize 'pain neurons'. I also study the phenomenon of long-term changes in the nervous system called neuroplasticity that is caused by chronic pain. Currently investigated methods to reverse neuroplasticity include direct brain intervention using pharmacological (analgesic small peptides, glial inhibitors, receptor blockers), technological (deep brain stimulation) and stem cell transplant approaches. I am part of a larger team within the department of neurosurgery that focuses mainly on translational research in the areas of pain, Alzheimer, Parkinson and stroke."

The immune system is also a defense mechanism and interaction between the nervous and the immune systems influences the intensity and duration of pain secondary to nerve damage. The challenge is to better understand this interaction and to propose approaches that would help in reversing neuroplasticity and consequently chronic pain."

S"The focus of my research group is to determine the origin, scale, composition and evolution of the heterogeneity in the Earth's and Moon's mantle using isotope, major, trace and volatile element geochemistry. One of the simplest ways of mapping the heterogeneity in the mantle is using the geochemistry of erupted basalts and mantle peridotites. However, to extract the deep mantle signature from basalts and mantle rocks we must first evaluate the effect that the interaction between melts and the oceanic lithosphere plays in modifying the composition of oceanic island and mid-ocean ridges basalts and massif peridotites. Recycling processes at subduction zones are considered one of the most important means of generating heterogeneity in the mantle. Thus, we have to understand the role that subduction dynamics plays on regulating the distribution of slab, mantle and crustal components between the volcanic arc and the deep mantle. Our research combines field and laboratory work for the collection and analysis of radiogenic isotope (Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf and U-series) and major, trace and volatile contents of basalts, phenochrysts and melt inclusions. Our analytical work utilizes state-of-the-art instruments such as electron and ion microprobe, thermal ionization mass spectrometer, and multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometer, either using sample solution or in-situ laser ablation."

S"I am editing a book that will be completed by the end of 2006 on the political statements of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson is often seen as apolitical until, at least, his abolitionist speeches near the end of the 1840s. More recent research has shown that he was probably sensitive to political theory even before then. I am selecting writings--including excerpts from his journal, and material from his letters and poems--to illustrate this new direction. In addition, I am writing a 10,000-word introduction, in which I lay out the background for Emerson's thinking, focusing especially on John Locke, the Scottish Common Sense School, Rousseau, Kant, and other Romantics.<br /><br />A longer term project will involve an investigation of how classical values inform on current day beliefs. A chapter focusing on martyrdom and resurrection--from the ancient world to the modern--is nearly complete."

S'My laboratory is focused on understanding how immune cells work in concert to eliminate pathogens from infected tissue sites.  Central to this process are a group of soluble proteins called cytokines that are produced by immune cells in order to communicate and coordinate the appropriate offensive response.  Chemotactic cytokines or chemokines act to direct the movement or trafficking of immune cells to tissues during infection or inflammation.  Research in my laboratory is characterizing the interplay between cytokines and chemokines, and their precise and nonredundant roles, in regulation of innate and adaptive immune cell trafficking.  These mechanisms are being investigated in the in vivo context of viral infections.  We have identified novel chemokine-dependent mechanisms promoting immune cell trafficking to the liver during infection, and a role for type 1 interferon in the regulation of chemokine responses mobilizing the egress of monocytes from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues.  Current studies are aimed at defining the intracellular signaling pathways regulating chemokine induction in the bone marrow, and the mechanisms that promote entry of innate immune cells into infected tissues.  Techniques in cellular immunology, virology, molecular biology, histology and in vivo trafficking assays, as well as gene-targeted and reporter mouse strains are being used. <br /><br />Another major area of research is directed at understanding how chronic alcoholism impairs host immunity to viral infections.  Specifically, we are evaluating the effects of chronic alcohol abuse on the signal transduction pathways maintaining the cytokine and chemokine balance promoting inflammation and regulation of antiviral immunity.  Information resulting from these studies will have important translational implications for the development of potential therapeutics for alcoholic patients.'

S'The long term goal of my research program is examine potential mechanisms for the development of psychopathology in children in order to prevent such disorders, find better diagnostic tools and create better treatment options. My work includes consideration of variables that contribute to resilience in those children that do not develop a psychiatric diagnosis.  This approach requires measurement of multiple systems of the developing child, including parental psychopathology and behavior, the infant-parent system, physiology, genetics, behavior, social communication, and the environment. The scope of my research program fosters collaboration with many other investigators at Brown University and other institutions.<br />My current research focuses on prenatal and postnatal neurobehavioral development of the fetus and fetal-maternal system in women who are depressed or using antidepressant medication.  The goal of the study is to evaluate fetal neurobehavior during exposure to maternal Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or SSRI medication use.  Currently, we do not fully understand the risks and/or benefits to the mother and her fetus from SSRI medications.  We also do not know if not treating MDD is a greater risk to the mother and fetus than SSRI medications. The data from the proposed study will give health care providers and their patients more information to draw upon when making treatment decisions during pregnancy.  Other applications of these data include examining the effect of SSRI medications on developing serotonin systems and how this may alter long-term behavioral and emotional outcomes.<br />Measurement of fetal neurobehavior is accomplished by monitoring and recording fetal heart rate, motor activity, behavioral state, and responsiveness to extra-uterine stimuli using a protocol and coding system we developed called the Fetal Neurobehavior Coding System (FENS).  The FENS was patterned after the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) developed by Dr. Barry Lester for at-risk infants.  The two methods are used across development for a cohesive assessment of neurobehavioral development. <br />We are currently using the FENS to study the effects of fetal exposure to antidepressant medications, maternal depression, and maternal smoking, as well as buprenorphine and methadone treatment of heroine addiction.'

S'The reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues is an important mechanism for modulating biological processes such as cellular signaling, differentiation, and growth.  A comprehensive understanding of these dynamic cellular processes at the molecular level requires the simultaneous detection of changes in the sites and levels of phosphorylation across numerous proteins over time and through space within the cell.  We employ fully automated, highly selective new methodologies that allow for the simultaneous assignment of the temporal and spatial pattern of phosphorylation sites from exceedingly complex mixtures derived from whole cell lysates.  This technological infrastructure is applied to the analysis of complex signaling networks in diverse biological and pharmacological contexts.<br /><br />Many cellular processes are directly controlled through the reversible phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues.  These regulatory functions are ultimately achieved through the coordinated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of numerous tyrosine residues across multiple proteins over time.  Clearly, benefits arise from individually characterizing specific components of a particular pathway, such as identifying a site of phosphorylation on a given protein, the kinase responsible for the modification, or the phosphatase responsible for its removal, or the identity of proteins that subsequently interact.  Ultimately though, a thorough understanding of these signaling pathways at the molecular level requires the thorough, simultaneous evaluation of all phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events&#151;changes in phosphorylation state&#151;over time.<br /><br />Emerging methodologies in mass spectrometry derive their utility through application to persistent, difficult problems in pharmacology and cellular biology.  The ability of the mass spectrometer to assign sites of phosphorylation and ubiquitination in complex mixtures of peptides represents an opportunity to greatly accelerate the elucidation of signaling pathways. Identification of novel signaling pathway members will provide targets for rational development of drugs that selectively inhibit these pathways.  Recent successes with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 (Gleevec) in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and with the HER2 receptor protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor Herceptin in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, illustrate the viability of targeting signaling pathway members to treat disease.'

S'Normal lung growth and development during fetal life are critical for extrauterine survival. Premature infants are often born before sufficient lung maturation has occurred, and as a result, they experience a high rate of long-term pulmonary complications, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, inadequate lung growth for gestational age (pulmonary hypoplasia) is found in ~25% of neonatal autopsies. These developmental lung disorders are a major source of infant morbidity and mortality. Understanding the mechanisms of perinatal lung growth and development is a crucial step for design of preventive and therapeutic strategies.<br /><br />Mechanical forces generated in utero by repetitive breathing movements and by fluid distension are essential to mammalian lung development. However, the mechanisms by which pulmonary cells sense and transduce mechanical signals are largely unknown.<br /><br />A key component of lung development is the differentiation of the alveolar type II epithelial cells, the major source of pulmonary surfactant that prevents alveolar collapse during expiration. Using an in vitro system, previous studies from our laboratory found that mechanical strain induces fetal type II cell maturation. This process is mediated via the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and the cAMP-PKA-dependent signaling pathways. In addition, we have identified potential roles for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and specific integrin subtypes in mechanotransduction during alveolar development. Current efforts are directed to understand how different receptors cross-talk to promote lung differentiation.<br /><br />The identification of key regulatory pathways regulating fetal type II cell differentiation may facilitate development of new approaches to accelerate lung maturation in clinical conditions where lung development is impaired.'

S'Most of my past and current research projects are concerned with understanding the formation of patterns and the dynamics of nonlinear waves in spatially extended systems. Extended systems are typically modelled by partial differential equations on unbounded domains. Nonlinear waves correspond to interfaces, or defects, that are formed between co-existing patterns. These patterns, as well as the defects and interfaces formed between them, are found in many biological, chemical, and physical applications. Examples are the transmission of signals in optical fibers, the formation of hexagonal and stripe patterns in fluid convection, and the generation of spiral waves in catalytic chemical reactions. Motivated by experiments and numerical simulations, I aim to understand when and how patterns and defects are formed, how they behave under small perturbations, what other patterns or waves with a more complicated spatio-temporal behaviour can bifurcate from them, and how they interact with each other or with domain boundaries. To answer these questions, I use a mixture of analytical and geometric dynamical-systems techniques, and I have also developed numerical algorithms for the computation of waves and their bifurcations.'

S"John Savage began his research career as a coding and information theorist within electrical engineering. The empirical observation that decoders for error-correcting codes are much more complex than encoders propelled him to investigate the complexity of decoders. This naturally led to a study of tradeoffs between computational resources and the study of circuit complexity, a fundamental computational measure in terms of which tradeoffs can be expressed. Much of this early work was captured in his 1976 book, <b>The Complexity of Computing</b>, which made evident the importance of circuit complexity to theoretical computer science. He co-authored a textbook for a computer literacy course with two undergraduates in the mid-1980s and in 1998 authored <b>Models of Computation</b>, a nearly comprehensive introduction to theoretical computer science.<br><br /><br><br />A recurring theme in Prof. Savage's work is the development of fundamental limits on computation, a theme that emerged in the study of decoder complexity. It has been expressed in the development of lower bounds, whether they be on a single resource, such as circuit size or depth, or expressed as tradeoffs between computational resources, such as space and time in serial computation, area and time in VLSI computation, or primary storage capacity and I/O operations in I/O-limited computations. It has also been seen in the classification of problems by their membership in traditional complexity classes, such as P, NP, and BPP. Another recurring theme has been the design and analysis of algorithms, which has been expressed in several areas including serial and parallel computer-aided design, distributed computing for scientific computation, and his recent work on computational nanotechnology. The challenge of the latter area is to produce deterministic computing elements when the assembly process is stochastic and unpredictable. Computer architecture, probability theory, and complexity analysis play important roles here. Computing with unreliable elements is a new area of interest as is cybersecurity."

In her book, The Forensic Stage: Settling Disputes in Graeco-Roman New Comedy,  she compares the legal scenarios of New Comedy to those in the Attic orators and treats legal procedures both inside and outside the courtroom. She continues to be interested in the connections between law and drama and has written a number of essays over the last decade on the subject; (e.g., "The rigmarole of the parasite\'s contract for a prostitute in Asinaria: Legal documents in Plautus and his predecessors"; "When A Gesture Was Misinterpreted: Did&#210;nai tity&#139;on in Menander\'s Samia"). She is currently co-editing (with Mike Fontaine) The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Comedy. Recent essays include \'Keeping Record, Making Public: the Epigraphy of Government,\' Blackwell\'s Companion to Ancient Greek Government (forthcoming) and \'The Legal Horizon of Euripides\' Ion: A Response to Delfim Le&#227;o,\' Symposion 2011: Vortr&#228;ge zur griechischen und hellenistischen Rechtsgeschichte (forthcoming). <br /><br />In spending so much time studying Athenian law, she has become interested in many different and difficult problems (usually related to the fragmentary state of the sources). She has focused on two: the (in-?)authenticity of laws (some ascribed to Solon) that have been inserted into the manuscripts of Demosthenes and the role of the prosecutor in public procedures. She has published a number of essays on the first set of problems (e.g., "Finding the Kernel of Solonian Laws"). Right now she is finishing a study of the Athenian prosecutor called \'Justice and the polis: trials by decree in ancient Athens\' for CUP. She believes she has demonstrated a greater flexibility than has hitherto been recognized in public procedure; in late 5th-century Athens, procedure is still developing, and some of the major public trials (the trials for impiety in 415, the non-trial of the Generals after Arginousai in 406, the trials against the "democratic conspirators" in 404) seem to shape investigative procedure in subsequent decades. Equally important, however, is the performative aspect that these trials exhibit in Athenian public and social discourse.<br /><br />Two new projects are epigraphic: one, on the habit of crowning: honorary decrees and civic performance in Athens (and probably elsewhere); the other, a collaborative project with Dr. Andronike Makres, constructing an epigraphical corpus, \'Inscriptions of Messenia excluding Messene.\'<br /><br /><br />Scafuro has been an International Guest at Leopold Wenger-Institut f&#252;r antike Rechtsgeschichte und Papyrusforschung in Munich; a participant in meetings of Symposion zur griechischen und hellenistischen Rechtsgeschichte; and a frequent visitor to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (and Visiting Whitehead Professor in 2004-05).

S'While fascinated with how ideas and narratives are adapted by authors, commentators, and redactors throughout the whole range of Sanskrit language, Indian philosophy, and Indian literature, Scharf is particularly interested in the intellectual history of Indian linguistic description, in the development of conceptions of the self, and in the creativity expressed through the adaptation of ancient narratives in new contexts.  In the linguistic sphere, he is engaged in a long-term research project to evaluate the descriptions of language undertaken by various ancient Indian linguists and to compare these descriptions with extant Sanskrit texts in order to elucidate the history of Indian linguistics and the history of Indian literature.  In the philosophical sphere, he is engaged in clarifying the ideas expressed in ancient Indian treatises concerning the nature of the self and its relation to the world in several philosophical schools including Sankhya, Yoga, Vedanta, and Buddhism.  He is also reediting the encyclopedic work by the medieval Vedic commentator Sadgurusisya and exploring the map of Vedic narrative literature it contains.  In collaboration with colleagues he is building an international digital Sanskrit library.<br /><br /><br /><b>Indian Linguistics</b><br /><br />Scharf argues that linguistics is the most important discipline in Indian intellectual history.  Not only does linguistic terminology and analysis pervade commentary in every field but in addition linguistic treatises describe the language in which works in every field are written.  Hence progress in the intellectual history of Indian linguistics promises to have far-reaching influence on Indian intellectual history generally.  His long-term research project is to evaluate the descriptions of language undertaken by various ancient Indian linguists and to compare these descriptions with extant Sanskrit texts.  He outlines the project in a paper on Paninian accounts of the Vedic subjunctive, shows how categorization of elements in lists ancillary to the Paninian rules alters the linguistic account of the grammatical system in a paper on class eight presents, demonstrates the correspondence of accentual description given in particular Vedic phonetic treatises with specific traditions of accent marking in manuscripts and with contemporary recitation, and outlines his project to model Indian linguistic description computationally in a paper on modeling Paninian grammar.  The first paper (2005), entitled "Paninian accounts of the Vedic subjunctive" (<a href="http://sanskritlibrary.org/ScharfSubjunctive.pdf">link</a>), evaluates the adequacy of competing accounts of the subjunctive profferred by commentators who interpret Paninian rules differently in order to account for its Vedic usage.  The second paper (forthcoming) entitled, "Paninian accounts of the class eight presents," evaluates the adequacy of competing linguistic accounts of verbal forms proffered by commentators on root-lists (<i>dhatupatha</i>) that represent and categorize these fundamental elements of the Paninian grammatical system differently.  The third paper, presented at the Fourth Vedic Workshop (2007), evaluates the relationship between the descriptions of accentuation in various Vedic phonetic treatises (<i>pratisakhya</i>) and compares them with the practices of marking accent in editions and manuscripts of the corresponding Vedic texts, and with contemporary Vedic recitation.  Exploration of the relationship between lexicalized accent, accent marking, and recitational tone promises to contribute to the history of Vedic dialects and schools.  Concurrently, under the purview of the digital Sanskrit library project, he and colleagues have submitted a proposal to extend Indian script code blocks in the Unicode standard to allow adequate representation of Vedic (<a href="http://sanskritlibrary.org/VedicUnicode/">link</a>).  The fourth paper, "Modeling Paninian Grammar" (<a href="http://sanskrit.inria.fr/Symposium/Program.html">Symposium program</a>, <a href="http://sanskrit.inria.fr/Symposium/DOC/Scharf.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="http://sanskrit.inria.fr/Symposium/DOC/Scharf_Slides.pdf">slides</a>), differentiates modeling Indian linguistic procedure computationally from computational implementation of Sanskrit grammar guided by contemporary theoretical and procedural concerns in linguistics and computer science.<br /><br />The evaluation of the adequacy of linguistic descriptions described above has emerged from earlier work he did in Indian linguistics.  For example, he elucidated Vedic usage by considering Panini\'s rules and the examples cited by his commentators in his paper on the term <i>dvay&#134;m</i> in the <i>Satapathabrahmana</i>, and he refuted a contemporary theoretical over-generalization using traditional philological analysis in his paper, "Interrogatives and Word-order in Sanskrit."<br /><br />The evaluation of the adequacy of linguistic descriptions also complements his work in Indian philosophy of language and Indian linguistics generally.  His book <i>The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy: Grammar, Nyaya, and Mimamsa</i> compared Patanjali\'s views in his <i>Mahabhasya</i> with those of Vatsyayana in the <i>Nyayasutrabhasya</i> and Sabara in the <i>Mimamsabhasya</i>.  In papers on class properties (<i>akrti</i>) and on intentionality (<i>vivaksa</i>), he demonstrated that the concepts of a class property and a speaker\'s intention could not have undergone the process of historical maturation between the second century B.C. and the fifth century C.E. assumed by certain scholars because the concepts of a class property and a speaker\'s intention are clearly articulated in Patanjali\'s <i>Mahabhasya</i> (150 B.C.).  "Panini, vivaksa, and karaka-rule-ordering" examined evidence that Panini himself assumed the principle of a speaker\'s intention.  His presentation, "Recognizing Speech," uncovered another case where proper elucidation of Patanjali\'s <i>Mahabhasya</i> showed that the concept was clearly understood at a period earlier than certain scholars had assumed.  Semantics in Indian thought continues to be a major thread in his research, for example in his paper, "Kaundabhatta on the Semantic Conditions for karakas," and his piece on Panini\'s use of prohibitive compounds.  He is currently preparing a major work on syntax and its conceptual presuppositions in Yaska\'s <i>Nirukta</i> and Panini\'s <i>Astadhyayi</i>.  In 2003 he presented a paper on the topic at the 12th World Sanskrit Conference that will appear in the <i>Proceedings</i>.<br /><br /><br /><b>The Self</b><br /><br />Scharf has been interested in concepts of the self in both European and Indian philosophy since he was an undergraduate.  He developed these ideas during a seminar he taught on Yoga philosophy at the University of Virginia, presented them at lectures at Pennsylvania State University, and has continued to explore them at Brown in his course on concepts of the self, in Sanskrit reading courses in the Upanisads, <i>Bhagavadgita</i>, and <i>Brahmasutras</i> with Sankara\'s commentaries, in Patanjali\'s <i>Yogasutra</i>, and in Buddhist philosophy.  This led him to elucidate the nature of consciousness in the <i>Brhadaranyaka Upanisad</i> in his paper on <i>samjna</i>.  In his piece, "Creation Mythology and Enlightenment," he explores how themes in Indian mythology concerning the origin of the universe complement philosophical themes concerning the full discovery of the self.  Most recently he wrote some twenty-seven articles on related topics for the Routledge <i>Encyclopedia of Hinduism</i>.  He has distant plans to retranslate Patanjali\'s <i>Yogasutra</i> and Vyasa\'s <i>Yogabhasya</i> on the basis of a study of Nagesa\'s untranslated commentary.<br /><br /><br /><b>Narrative Adaptation</b><br /><br />One of the most enjoyable pursuits in the study of Sanskrit literature is to explore the motivations for the adaptation of narratives in subsequent versions.  In advanced Sanskrit reading courses Scharf often traces the interpretation of a Vedic myth in various genres through the history of Indian literature.  One such myth is that of Pururavas and Urvasi.  In a paper entitled, "The Compassionate Urvasi," (a Sanskrit version of which was presented in Melakote, India) he reexamines the interpretation of <i>Rgveda</i> 10.95 in subsequent Indian literature, including in Sadgurusisya\'s <i>Vedarthadipika</i>.  Because Sadgurusisya\'s work is full of narratives related to various Rgvedic hymns, Scharf was led to collect manuscripts of Sadgurusisya\'s work for the purpose of making a critical edition.  With the assistance of a grant from the American Philosophical Society he collected more than fifty manuscripts of the text which he has begun to collate.  (See the project description.)  Similarly, tracing the interpretation of the story of Rama in various genres in advanced Sanskrit classes led to his book on the <i>Ramopakhyana</i>, and to papers on the ethics of the final episodes, and on Sita\'s divinity (presented at Brown and the American Oriental Society).  Exploration of the methods of, and motivations for, the adaptation of ritual practice are equally intriguing.  He and his student Kartik Venkatesh analyzed the structure and adaptation of puja in five major Indian festivals and have nearly completed a book on the topic.<br /><br />In a paper presented at the Montreal Mahabharata Conference and published as a chapter of Rukmani\'s book on the <i>Mahabharata</i>, Scharf argue for publication of multi-level text.  In contrast to a translation devoid of notes that presents the reader with a single, static, flat version of a narrative, multilevel text that includes comments, notes, alternatives, multimedia accompaniments, etc. can communicate the source work more fully and meaningfully.  In presentations at Brown he has argued that we are in the midst of a major media-transition.  The transition from printed to digital media is comparable to the transitions from oral to written media, and from written to printed media.  Productions of human knowledge that don\'t convert to the new media recede from public awareness and perish in oblivion.  In order to insure that the vast body of knowledge contained in Sanskrit texts survives the transition to digital media, and to take advantage of the greater range and flexibility for research and presentation it offers, he founded a digital Sanskrit library (<a href="http://sanskritlibrary.org/">sanskritlibrary.org</a>).  After receiving several minor grants, he obtained a major grant from the NSF to coordinate linguistic software with digital lexica and digital text archives.<br /><br /><br /><b>Digital Sanskrit Library</b><br /><br />In order to facilitate comprehensive comparisons between various ancient Indian linguistic descriptions and Sanskrit texts, and to facilitate general access to Sanskrit literature, lexica, and grammars, Scharf is engaged in a collaborative project with colleagues at Brown, Buffalo, Cologne, and Frankfurt to develop an integrated international digital Sanskrit library.  The three-year project, funded by the National Science Foundation\'s Division of Intelligent Systems, integrates the linguistic software modeling Paninian derivation, inflection and sandhi rules, developed by him and his colleague Malcolm Hyman at Brown, with bilingual lexical resources digitized in the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon project, and machine-readable Sanskrit texts in the TITUS archive at Frankfurt.  Simultaneously their work is facilitating the development of Devanagari optical character recognition software by their collaborator at the Center for Excellence in Document Analysis and Recognition at Buffalo.  Scharf and his colleagues aim to build an integrated digital library that allows seemless access to grammatical information and lexical sources by clicking words in texts, and access to citations in context by clicking citations in lexical sources.  The system will facilitate linguistic, philological, and topical research in Sanskrit generally, much as the Perseus project has in Classical philology.<br /><br />One task of the Sanskrit library project is to develop encoding standards.  As mentioned, Scharf has proposed to extend Indian script code blocks in the Unicode standard to accommodate special characters in Vedic.  The Unicode standard is a script-based encoding.  While using Unicode for display, Scharf devised an independent phonetic encoding scheme to facilitate internal linguistic processing and to allow users to choose modes of display including both Roman and Devanagari.  He and Hyman consider the linguistic issues of coding Sanskrit, or any language, in their forthcoming book <i>Linguistic Issues in Encoding Sanskrit</i>.  Beta versions of their inflection software and analyzer, and the dictionary interface they developed in collaboration with Jim Funderburk, are located at the following links:<br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://sanskritlibrary.org/morph/">Nominal morphology</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://sanskritlibrary.org/verb/">Verbal morphology</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/analyze/">Analyzer</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/">Dictionary</a></li><br /></ul>'

S'Interested in the nature of the self, the universe, their relationship, and how language shapes conceptions of them, Scharf majored in philosophy at Wesleyan University.  There he pursued interests related to the philosophy of language by studying logic and the foundations of mathematics.  Also related to language but from a different perspective, he learned classical Greek motivated by a desire to have unmediated access to the original texts of ancient philosophers.  The desire to pursue the same interests in Asian traditions, which have been neglected in American education, led him to study Indian philosophy and Sanskrit at the University of Pennsylvania.  After a post-doctoral research associateship at the University of Pennsylvania and teaching for a semester at the University of Virginia, he joined the Classics Department at Brown in 1992.'

S'My current research focuses on the nature of a priori knowledge &#150; for instance, knowledge of logical, mathematical, and moral truths. For each of these domains, we ordinarily accept two claims that are in tension. On the one hand, we believe that the relevant facts are objective in the sense that they do not depend on our language, thoughts, or social practices. On the other hand, we believe that we know many of these facts, and that this knowledge is independent of our experience of the world around us. That we have this knowledge requires explanation, but it is difficult to envision plausible explanations compatible with the objectivity of the domains. In particular, for each domain, there are two main facts that need to be explained. First, it must be explained how it is that we are, by-and-large, reliable in believing truths and disbelieving falsehoods. Second, it must be explained how it is that we are justified &#150; or, rather, epistemically responsible &#150; in holding many of the beliefs that we do. The goal of my research is to explicate these two explanatory challenges and show how they may be met.<br /><br />In my work to date, I have focused on our knowledge of logic. To meet the reliability challenge for logic, I distinguish two questions: How does our deductive cognitive machinery work such that we are reliable, and how is it that we have reliable deductive cognitive machinery? The first question is subject to a straightforward response: Our deductive machinery is reliable because we employ rules of inference that necessarily are truth-preserving. To answer the second question, I provide an evolutionary account, according to which possessing logical concepts and employing reliable deductive rules both conferred survival advantages on our ancestors. To meet the responsibility challenge, I offer and defend a novel account of epistemic responsibility. In broad outline, I argue that thinkers are epistemically responsible in employing rules of inference that are indispensable for successfully engaging in those cognitive projects in which thinkers are rationally required to engage. Our epistemic responsibility for believing logical truths thus derives from the important role deductive rules play in our thought.<br /><br />I am currently extending this work by examining the prospects of applying my strategy for explaining our knowledge of logic to other domains of a priori knowledge. The natural cases to consider next are mathematical, moral, and modal truths. (Modal truths are truths that concern what is possible and what is necessary). For each of these domains, the task again can be divided into the task of explaining our reliability and the task of explaining our epistemic responsibility. However, each of these domains is significantly different from logic. The truth of mathematical claims involves the existence of abstract entities such as numbers and sets. The truth of moral claims involves normativity. The truth of modal claims depends on how the world might have been, and not just on how it is. Explanations of our reliability and responsibility must take these features into account.<br /><br />I have several other research interests. I am broadly interested in epistemology. I take it that examining the epistemology of the a priori is useful for garnering insights about the nature of knowledge and epistemic responsibility in general. I am also interested in the nature of logic and logical concepts: What are logical concepts? What is the purpose of possessing logical concepts? What is the relationship between logic and reasoning? Additional interests include issues concerning explanation: For instance, when does a fact "call out" for explanation? Finally, I am also interested in the nature of content in general, and the prospects for a conceptual role-based semantics for mental content in particular, as well as the nature of belief.'

S"For over a century of the nation's early history, United States senators were elected by state legislatures.  Until the passage of the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the first popular senatorial elections in 1914, senatorial elections in the state legislatures forced an intense focus on state electoral politics.  Any observer of national politics had to follow state elections in each of (eventually) 48 states and the internal organization of 48 separate state legislatures.   <br /><br />In the Senate Elections Data Project 1871-1913, we have gathered original data from 48 states on legislative rosters, length of service, chamber organization votes, party cohesion, and ballots for U.S. Senators for all Senate election held during that time. <br />We have a series of preliminary papers that address how effective party majorities were in securing victory for their preferred candidate, how and why conflict erupted over Senate elections leading to extended joint session balloting, and how the bicameral nature of state legislatures played a role in the extent of conflict in these elections.  We expect a draft of our book manuscript in Fall 2010."

S'The predominant focus of my work is methodological:  decision analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and related topics.  I am currently applying that methodology to three main clinical areas, antiplatelet therapy, nursing home policy, and breast cancer.<br /><br />Antiplatelet therapy:  An ongoing line of my research included evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of antiplatelet medications designed to reduce the risk of thrombotic events, which may include stroke or myocardial infarction.  This work has centered on one medication, clopidogrel, either alone or in combination with aspirin, and has also considered different populations:  those with a prior stroke, a prior myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, or with recent acute cardiac events, including stroke implantation.  <br /><br />Nursing home policy:  Hospitalization is typically viewed as an adverse event for long-term nursing home residents, as it represents a potential failing of preventative care, and may be associated with adverse events for frail elders.  It is also costly.  In collaboration with researchers from the Brown Center for Gerontology and the Department of Community Health, I have been involved in a line of work evaluating the effect of State policies and nursing home organizational practices on hospitalization related outcomes.  We have identified a number of such interventions that are significantly associated with the hospitalization rate.  We are currently completing a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the financial impact of these interventions.  This is particularly warranted as there is potential misalignment of financial incentives between the States, which typically pay for nursing home care via Medicaid, and the Federal government, which pays for hospitalizations via Medicare.  We are finding that interventions that reduce hospitalization increase costs to the States, but result in savings for Medicare.<br /><br />Breast cancer:  Ongoing work in breast cancer has focused on two topics:  cost-effectiveness of emerging breast cancer screening modalities, and using decision-analysis to evaluate breast cancer treatment disparities.  I am eliciting quality of life outcomes and conducting cost-effectiveness analyses in synchrony with protocol 6666 of the American College of Radiology Imaging Network.  This prospective, multi-institution, multi-year project is designed to assess the efficacy of annual whole breast ultrasound in addition to mammography in women at high-risk of breast cancer.  A recently approved supplement will add MRI to the assessed screening technologies.<br /><br />I have recently completed a project in which I assessed utilities, a subjective measure of quality of life, for breast cancer health states from a socio-demographically diverse sample of women.  In accordance with the principles of utility theory outlined by von Neumann and Morgenstern, I used these utilities to model a breast cancer treatment decision, and found that Black, older, less affluent and unmarried women expressed utilities suggesting they would be less likely to accept chemotherapy should they be diagnosed with breast cancer at a stage for which chemotherapy would typically be recommended.  This suggests that utilities may reflect sources of disparity, such as access to care, perceived discrimination and financial barriers.  I am currently seeking funding to pursue the degree to which causes of healthcare disparities affect utilities.'

S'I have written extensively on theatre and performance practices that stretch  accepted borders around media. My first book engaged with artists who use their own bodies as the stage for their performances, situating them within theatre and art historical traditions of the "avant-garde" and reading their work relative to feminist and race critical theory. Since that book, I have written on performance art, photography, architecture, and everyday life as "performative."  <br /><br />My second book, titled <i>Performing Remains: Art and War in Times of Theatrical Reenactment</i>, focused on practices in visual and performance art that labor under the rubric "reenactment." In it, I explore the wide range of both live and mediated performance &#151; mostly in performance art, theatre, and photography &#151; that attempts to "step into time" and duplicate or even "touch"  prior historical acts and events.  For this book, I studied Civil War reenactments and the passionate investments of those who engage in reenactment. I compared the activities of "living history" with related practices of temporal travel in the frames of visual art and theatre (and their intermedial cousins). I contend that in much museum and pedagocial practice,  the site of authenticity has shifted off of the historical object and onto the very vexed category of "experience" in relationship to historical knowledge. So, too, has the site in experimental art been shifting for many years off of the art object understood as discrete, and onto engagement with its display and its circulation vis a vis the "experience" of the art participant. It is these shifts, their problems and promises, that that book charts and explores.<br /><br />I am currently at work on a third book on the topic of "Acting in Ruins." This project looks at the live body in relation to statuary, the ruins of historical theatre, and also the raises the question of whether there are ruins not just of theatre, but ruins of performance. I am working on this project with Professor Nick Ridout of Queen Mary University.'

S"In general, my work falls into the area of infinite groups, geometric topology, projective and hyperbolic geometry, and dynamics.  Here are the 5 examples of projects I have been involved in during the course of my career:<br /><br />1. infinite group theory and geometric rigidity:  An infinite finitely generated group has associated to it a Cayley graph, a combinatorial object which captures a lot of the large-scale geometry of the group.  One can ask whether different groups give rise to Cayley graphs which are, in some sense, roughly the same.   I have studied this problem for a natural collection of groups which arise in geometry and number theory, namely the nonuniform lattices of Q rank one.  These include fundamental groups of hypobolic knot complements, and Hilbert modular groups.  I proved a sweeping classification theorem for these groups, showing essentially that even a fairly blind person could<br />recognize the group by looking at its Cayley graph.<br /><br />2. Groups of symmetries of the complex hyperbolic plane:  The complex hyperbolic plane is a four-dimensional curved symmetric space.  I have studied infinite groups of symmetries acting on this space.  My most recent result in this area is a general surgery theorem which tells how the associated 3-manifold at infinity changes during the deformation of a discrete group with nonempty domain of discontinuity. Some of this work was the subject of my address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2002.  I have recently completed a research monograph, to be published in the  Princeton Annals of Math series, which details my surgery theorem.<br /><br />3. Dynamical systems based on geometric constructions:  Here one starts with a simple geometric construction, such as barycentric subdivision or Pappus's theorem, and creates a dynamics system based on repeated applications of the construction. I investigate these constructions with the use of a computer and then try to prove theorems about what I observe.  For instance, I proved that the iteration of barycentric subdivision of an N dimensional simplex produces a dense set of shapes for N less or equal to 4.<br /><br />4. triangular billiards:  Recently I proved that a triangular billiard table has a periodic billiard path, provided that all its angles are at most 100 degrees. I discovered this result using McBilliards, a graphical user interface that I co-wrote with Pat Hooper to study this problem.  My result represents the first substantial progress on the 200-year-old Triangular Billiards Problem, which asks if every triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path.<br /><br />5.  Outer billiards is a simple dynamical system based on a convex planar shape.  This system was introduced by B.H. Neumann in the 1950's.  All along the central question in the subject was:  Does there exist a shape for which the corresponding system has an <br />unbounded orbit.  Recently I solved this problem by showing that outer billiards has an<br />unbounded orbit when defined relative to any irrational kite.  A kite is a kite-shaped<br />quadrilateral."

S'The Sedivy laboratory is funded by two major grants: "Genetic Studies of c-Myc Gene Function in the Cell Cycle" (NIH GM41690), and "Mechanisms of Replicative Senescence in Human Cells" (NIH AG16694). The key objectives of each project are outlined below. <br /><br />Genetic Studies of c-Myc Gene Function in the Cell Cycle <br /><br />The goal of this project is to answer the question: How does the c-myc protooncogene regulate cellular proliferation? The c-Myc protein is a transcription factor, and a large number of genes have been proposed to be targets of its regulation. c-Myc has been implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death, but the mechanisms by which it exerts its activity on the cellular machinery are complex and not well understood. Our fascination with c-Myc stems not only from our interest in understanding basic molecular regulatory mechanisms, but also because the deregulation of c-Myc activity is associated with a wide range of human cancers. A genetic analysis can often lead to profound insights into molecular mechanisms, and the construction of knockout mice can be especially powerful. Unfortunately, the c-myc knockout mouse, because of its early embryonic lethality, did not yield insights into either cellular or molecular phenotypes. All attempts to recover c-myc -/- cells from homozygous embryos have been frustrated by the outgrowth of cells that express one of the other Myc family members. To overcome this problem, we used gene targeting to eliminate c-myc expression in a fibroblast cell line shown not to express the other family members. These knockout cells are the first experimental system in which c-myc loss-of-function phenotypes can be thoroughly investigated. The c-myc -/- cells are viable but display profound cell cycle defects. We have initiated a systematic molecular analysis of known cell cycle regulators in the c-myc -/- cells. Our new insights to date are: 1) loss of c-myc affects progression through both the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle; 2) the activity of all cyclin-Cdk complexes is affected; 3) the earliest and most prominent defect is an impairment in the activation of cyclin D-Ddk4/6 complexes; 4) c-Myc affects multiple points in the cell cycle, both before and after the restriction point; and 5) loss of c-Myc has profound effects on the accumulation of cellular mass (cell growth). Our objective is to build on these results to fully elucidate how c-Myc regulates transition through the cell cycle. We are currently working towards constructing homozygous c-myc knockouts in human cells, isolating new c-Myc target genes by a combination of microarray expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, defining the biochemical lesions in G1 and G2 cell cycle mechanisms that result from loss of c-Myc activity, and genetically testing the physiological relevance of the observed biochemical lesions. <br /><br />Mechanisms of Replicative Senescence in Human Cells <br /><br />Two fundamentally different aging phenomena have been described at the cellular level: 1) the gradual decline of life processes in postmitotic cells, and 2) the decline and eventual complete cessation of cell division observed in most replicating cell lineages. The former is measured in simple chronological time, and comes into play during the aging of postmitotic adult organisms, such as the nematode, or during the aging of largely postmitotic tissues, such as the brain or muscle in more complex organisms. In contrast, finite replicative lifespan, often referred to as \'cellular replicative senescence\', is measured in terms of cell divisions rather than chronological time. The current consensus is that both postmitotic and replicative aging processes are causally related to the aging of humans. The topic of this research project is the molecular mechanism of replicative aging processes, specifically, the molecular machine that actually executes and maintains senescence. The major tool is targeted homologous recombination (gene targeting), which is being performed in normal (nonimmortalized) fibroblastic human cell strains. The targets of gene targeting are the following genes: the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), and the Cdk kinase inhibitors p16INK4A, p19ARF, and p21CIP1/WAF1. The objective is to ablate gene action and subsequently investigate the resultant senescence phenotypes on both the cellular and molecular levels. This direct interventive approach is expected to reveal the functionally relevant components of the molecular senescence machine. The project is based on a model which predicts that the molecular machine that establishes senescence is composed of components that also play roles in cell cycle control during the normal proliferative lifespan of the cell, specifically, the p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways. All experiments are being performed in normal human cells grown in in vitro cell culture. This is because a large body of evidence indicates that the regulation of replicative senescence mechanisms is significantly different in humans and in rodents. Therefore, due to the ethical unacceptability of experimentally altering the human germ line, and the limited utility of the rodent model to address the specific issues under investigation, the whole-organism transgenic route is not appropriate and the experimental model has been confined to human somatic cell culture.'

He started his independent research career at Yale University in 1988.<br /><br />John Sedivy is recognized for his efforts in mammalian genetics, having developed and pioneered methods for gene targeting of somatic cells. His research on cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, focusing on the Myc oncogene, has been continuously funded by the NIH since 1989. In 1995 his laboratory isolated the first viable gene knockouts of the c-myc oncogene, and these cell lines have become the premier model system in the Myc field. In 1997 his laboratory succeeded in isolating the first homozygous gene knockout in a normal human cell. Since 1998 his laboratory has pursued, in addition to the Myc project, studies of human replicative senescence (in vitro cell aging).<br /><br />In addition to writing the first comprehensive book on gene targeting in 1992, John Sedivy has published over 90 original articles. He has served on numerous study sections and advisory committees at the NIH, the American Cancer Society, and the US Army Breast Cancer Initiative. He has consulted extensively on the genetic manipulation of mammalian cells to the biotech industry, including Biogen, Eli Lilly & Co., Abbott Laboratories, and Millenium Pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />In 2000 John Sedivy became the Principal Investigator of a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) award from the National Center for Research Resources (NIH), an award that to date has brought over $ 22 million to Brown University over a period of 10 years. The COBRE award has been used to establish a Mouse Knockout and Transgenic Core Facility, a Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility, and to fund numerous pilot projects in the Division of Biology and Medicine.

S'My primary research interests involve questions about the representations and processes that underlie human natural language understanding. Many of the difficult questions in this area arise as a result of the fact that the human language processing system interprets linguistic input incrementally; that is, it begins to assign structure to linguistic input continuously as the input is heard or read. This results in a massive problem of indeterminacy, where the processing system must frequently choose between a number of structures that are possible at a given point in time, but where only one of these structures will ultimately turn out to be the correct one. <br /><br />My research has focused on the information the processing system uses to make such decisions. In particular, I am interested in what humans know about the relationship between the form of a sentence and its meaning in the world, and how they use this knowledge in real-time language processing. I have argued that the way in which incoming linguistic input is structured by the processing system depends to a large degree on establishing links between linguistic expressions and the entities that they refer to in the world, as well as relevant properties of those entities. A particularly useful technique for studying this relationship has involved monitoring the eye movements of people to real objects in the world as they listen to sentences with various structures that involve reference to some of the objects in the visual display. Work in this paradigm, as well as more traditional reading time paradigms, suggests that humans are extremely sensitive to certain kinds of information about the real world, and can use this information in deciding which of a number of possible structures to pursue in the course of processing a sentence.'

S'I research human language understanding. In particular, I am interested in the process by which humans assign meaning to words and phrases. Linguists know that as humans process language we make decisions about the words millisecond by millisecond. For example, when someone pronounces the first syllable of "elephant," the human mind considers and discards words with the same first syllable, such as "eloquent" and "elevator," even before hearing the rest of the word. Given that moment-by-moment decision process, how do humans cope with uncertainty at every stage?'

S'Professor Seifert\'s research has concentrated on two broad areas: seventeenth-century French literature/culture and folk- and fairy-tale narratives. The central focus of his work has been on questions of gender and sexuality as manifested in both literary and historical contexts. He has also explored problems of early modern authorship and political discourse and has investigated literary renditions of Francophone oral traditions. <br /><br />In <i>Fairy Tales, Sexuality and Gender in France, 1690-1715: Nostalgic Utopias</i> (Cambridge UP, 1996), he explored reasons why the fairy tale genre appeared in late seventeenth-century France and in particular its ambivalent representations of femininity, masculinity, and (hetero)sexuality. This book argues that the "marvelous" universe of the <i>conte de f&#233;es</i> is a throw-back to earlier fictional forms that often allows for a critique of the past and an articulation of yet-to-be conceived identities and relations. <br /><br />Seifert\'s book-length study <a href="http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=354488">Manning the Margins: Masculinity and Writing in Seventeenth-Century France</a> (University of Michigan Press, forthcoming 2009) investigates the struggle between the expectation of dominance and the risk of subservience and marginality that emerges in such seventeenth-century figures as the honn&#234;te homme, the male salon denizen, the sodomite, and the transvestite. <br /><br />He is currently pursuing future research projects around two different questions. First, bringing to bear insights from a variety of contemporary thinkers, he is interested in clarifying the multiple connections and ruptures between the (early modern French) past and the (French and American) present. Second, in comparative and transhistorical ways, he wishes to investigate how fairy tales have been used to justify and to contest sexual ideologies, from the theoretical to the pragmatic.<br /><br />Seifert is also involved with collaborative projects, among them a translation of seventeenth-century French women\'s fairy tales with Domna C. Stanton (City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center) for the University of Chicago Press and a collection of essays on masculinity in French and Francophone cultures (University of Delaware Press, 2008) with Todd Reeser (University of Pittsburgh).'

S"My current project, provisionally titled <i>A New Political Order: The Politics of Gender and Sexuality at the End of the American Century</i>, takes my interest in political culture and liberalism in new directions.  National in scope, the book is an exploration of how the sexual revolution, feminism(s), gay and lesbian liberation, and the new Right transformed American politics between 1964 and 2004.  I treat the interaction and collision of these forces as an expansive process that included the multiple gender disruptions of the period: from the Vietnam War's problematic male soldier to the politics of abortion, welfare, black power, and gay liberation.  In between the Civil Rights Act (1964), Watts rioting (1965), and the Moynihan Report (1965) and the Bush-era insurgencies of the 2000s, I trace the search for new male and female political subjectivities and the contests over manhood, feminism(s), and gay rights that remade liberalism in the intervening decades."

S'I study antibiotic biosynthesis as a physiological phenomenon. Recent advances in experimental chemistry and biology make it is possible to analyze antibiotic biosynthesis on a scale and at a resolution previously unimaginable. My training in synthetic chemistry, protein biochemistry, and molecular genetics enables me to capitalize on the emerging opportunities in this interdiscplinary research area. With this broad expertise, I am prepared to carry out penetrating, "system-level" analyses of antibiotic production in vivo. The subject of my studies will be Streptomyces bacteria. These soil bacteria and their close relatives among the actinomycetes are best known as producers of nearly two-thirds of the 10,000 known antibiotics, many of which have tremendous value in clinical and veterinary medicine (e.g., FK506, tetracycline, bleomycin, doxorubicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, and avermectin). Since the 1950s, pharmaceutical companies have fermented these organisms on very large scales to produce many of our medicines. Accordingly, much is known about their genetics and physiology. However, there is much to be learned about the molecular mechanisms that enable and regulate antibiotic production in streptomycetes and actinomycetes in general. To advance knowledge of these mechanisms I will study the best-characterized actinomycete, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), which produces four chemically distinct antibiotics via discrete biosynthetic pathways. Much about this organism is known as it has been studied intensively for over half of a century. Its genome has been sequenced and powerful tools for systematic gene manipulation, transcription profiling, and proteome analyses of S. coelicolor have been developed. These tools have yielded important new insights into Streptomyces biology. Although the changes in gene expression during antibiotic production have been measured, the corresponding changes in the concentrations of metabolites have not been characterized. To illuminate these changes, I will develop methods that enable measurement of the flux of low-molecular weight metabolites into pathways for antibiotic production. In addition, I will synthesize compounds that are capable of perturbing metabolic flux. These tools will be used synergistically with established biochemical methods for transcriptomics and proteomics to generate a molecular resolution description of the changes in Streptomyces physiology during antibiotic production. These methods will also be useful in comparative analyses of wild-type Streptomyces strains and those optimized by the pharmaceutical industry for the production of large quantities of antibiotics. These analyses are likely to reveal the cryptic physiological features associated with the over-production of antibiotics. Recognition of these features may suggest how streptomycetes can be rationally engineered for the production of large quantities of antibiotics.'

S"A protein's activity is a direct manifestation of its structure, and the cell expends considerable energy to ensure that a nascent protein efficiently adopts a single, correct three-dimensional fold.  In theory, the road map from synthesis to functional form is specified by the protein's primary sequence of amino acids, but in practice, nascent proteins frequently misfold into alternate conformations.    In most instances, cells recognize these aberrant forms and target them to molecular chaperones for refolding or to proteases for destruction.  However, a group of proteins known as prions is an exception to these rules.  Prions have the capacity to adopt multiple stable forms in vivo, and, since a protein's structure determines its function, cells containing the same protein in two different conformations will have different phenotypes.   For instance, one conformation of the mammalian prion protein PrP is non-pathogenic, while other forms likely mediate the development of severe neurodegenerative disease (e.g., mad cow disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, kuru).  Remarkably, some of these diseases are infectious, suggesting that the aberrant protein conformations are acting as genetic elements, a role historically limited to nucleic acids.  <br /><br />How do prion proteins act in these atypical roles?  A fine-tuned regulation of prion protein structural flexibility is key.  If each newly synthesized molecule of a prion protein could independently choose between forms, all cells would display a single phenotype that is the average of the two states.  The appearance of distinct phenotypes in vivo suggests that while the prion protein remains flexible enough to access multiple forms, its folding is somehow constrained in any given cell such that only one form persists. <br />Our current work seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the near-faithful propagation of prion forms in vivo using the Sup35/[PSI+] prion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an experimental model."

S'Most of the work in visual neuroscience has focused on the brain mechanisms underlying the rapid recognition of simple visual scenes using artificial, static and isolated stimuli. However our visual world is both highly dynamic and complex, with typical visual scenes consisting of many objects embedded in background clutter. The result: Our visual cortex must process noisy and ambiguous perceptual measurements. The success of everyday vision implies powerful neural mechanisms, yet to be understood, for combining bottom-up, sensory-driven information with top-down, attention and memory-driven processes to help resolve visual ambiguities and discount irrelevant clutter.<br /><br />To help realize this goal, I played a leading role as a graduate student and postdoc at MIT in the development of a large-scale, neurophysiologically accurate computational model of visual processing in the primate cortex. The computer model emulates the main information processing steps across the entire cortical visual pathway and bridges the gap between multiple levels of understanding: This system-level model seems consistent with physiological data in primates in different cortical areas of the ventral visual pathway, as well as behavioral data during rapid categorization tasks with natural images. These findings suggest that bottom-up, sensory-driven processes may provide a satisfactory description of the very first pass of information in the visual cortex. Recent extensions of the model for the processing of motion information and attentional mechanisms are already impacting brain science, with researchers at Brown and MIT using the model as a guide for designing new monkey electrophysiology experiments. <br /><br />While still a fairly incomplete model of vision, we found that this early model performs on par, or better than, state-of-the-art computer vision systems for the recognition of objects in street scene images as well as human actions in videos. These findings have generated strong interest from the scientific community, with over 2,000 downloads for the source code of the model, and extensive coverage in the popular press, including the BBC and Scientific American. I believe that this bio-inspired approach to computer vision will soon have a significant influence in other areas of the physical and life sciences. For instance, we very recently developed an initial high-throughput system for the automated monitoring and analysis of rodent behavior, which performs on par with human annotators in scoring videos of typical mice behaviors. Rodent labs at Brown, Harvard, MIT and the Broad Institute are already using the system for large-scale behavioral phenotyping studies.'

S'The diversity of our publications this year demonstrates that all aspects of my research program are moving ahead.  One of our papers describes our development of inhibitors for protein tyrosine phosphatases.  These enzymes play an important role in controlling all intracellular signal transduction pathways, and inhibitors of phosphatases are useful for treating a variety of diseases including type II diabetes and infection by Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague.  We have examined how the linker structure in a series of divalent inhibitors influences their potency, and discovered inhibitors with nanomolar activity against the Yersinia phosphatase.  Three papers describe our continuing work to develop potent and selective inhibitors for a variety of proteases.  Inhibitors of the serine protease plasmin have potential as cancer chemotherapeutic agents that are targeted toward the processes of metastasis and angiogenesis.  We have also discovered that squaric/hydroxamic acid hybrids are a completely new motif for the design of matrix metalloprotease inhibitors.  This study represents a new research direction for my group.<br /><br />Our other three papers are in the general area of asymmetric catalysis.  This is an area that is a major focus of current research in organic chemistry, and it is critical for the production of pharmaceutical agents and fine chemicals.  Two of the manuscripts describe our discovery of modular amino acid-based catalysts for the enantioselective addition of vinylzinc reagents to aldehydes to yield chiral allylic alcohols.  Using an iterative optimization strategy we have found catalysts for this reaction that give up to 95% enantiomeric excess and excellent yields.  The final manuscript describes our use of an enzyme as high throughput tool to measure the enantiomeric excess of large numbers of samples.  This work broadens our previously described EMDee procedure (enzymatic method to determine ee) by requiring the enzyme to simply bind to the analyte, rather than process it as a substrate.  In this manuscript, we describe the application of this strategy to the analysis of chiral sulfoxides.'

S'Our research interests are aimed toward investigating and manipulating the noncovalent interactions that govern molecular recognition in biological systems. We are studying interactions between proteins and their ligands, between proteins and DNA, and the noncovalent interactions that dictate protein secondary and tertiary structure. These projects utilize traditional tools of organic chemistry such as synthesis and spectroscopic evaluation of molecular structure and conformation, and also employ a variety of more biological techniques such as electrophoresis, enzymology, and protein isolation and purification.'

S'The laboratory worked on the regulatory genes of the AIDS retrovirus HIV-1. We are particularly interested in understanding the mechanism of action of the tat gene. This essential positive regulatory gene is unique among transcriptional activators in that the gene product interacts with an RNA structure at the end of the HIV-1 genome. It was our hope that by understanding the mechanism of action of this gene, we will be able to design effective antiviral therapeutics. We are also examining the action of similar genes from HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).<br /><br />AIDS patients frequently present with B-cell malignancies and we were interested in asking whether the virus played a direct role in this disease.  In collaboration with Dr. Surendra Sharma we were able to show that HIV-1 can infect human B-cells in culture in a CD4 independent manner'

S'Dr. Surendra Sharma is Professor and Deputy Director of Center of Biomedical Research Excellence at Women and Infants Hospital&#151;Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA. He is an internationally known investigator in the field of Immune Programming of Pregnancy and Associated Disorders and was recently awarded the Honorary Doctor of Medicine Degree from Linkoping University Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping, Sweden.  He serves as a permanent member on review boards for the NIH and the American Diabetes Association as well as on editorial boards of several journals. His academic interests are as follows. Gestational outcomes are programmed at the time of implantation and during early pregnancy, apparently in defiance of the normal immunological laws of tissue transplantation. The process of normal implantation and early pregnancy success is regulated by exquisite integration and coordination of an array of biological processes. The molecular basis of this roadmap is diverse and not fully understood. The Sharma laboratory has a multifaceted research program focused on answering the question of why some women are predisposed to pregnancy complications. We believe that these problems may originate from abnormal immune and hormonal responses during pregnancy. The hypothesis is that anti-inflammatory intrauterine milieu controlled by cytokines and pregnancy hormones is crucial to fetal development and pregnancy success.'

S'As we interact with our surroundings, the gap between looking and knowing is usually quick and effortless. But by what processes is this accomplished? How do we make sense of what we see?<br /><br />Current projects in the lab are exploring the dynamic nature of visual processing. In the real world, visual observers constantly update their view of their environment by changing their direction of gaze. At the same time, objects in the environment are often themselves animate, and the characteristic dynamic behaviors of these objects provide rich information about the identities and actions of objects in the world. We are particularly interested in how the brain acquires a dynamic stream of visual information and efficiently parses this information to reach conclusions about the presence or absence of noteworthy objects to which actions should be directed.<br /><br />We are also investigating how representations in the brain are dynamic, changing over time to reflect the learned structure of individual objects and the context in which these objects appear. Perceptual learning and visual expertise are perhaps the most obvious forms of plasticity that continue to manifest in adult animals, and we believe changes in receptive field properties of individual cells and networks of cells underlie changes in perceptual capacities. Our aim is to simultaneously explore changes in behavioral performance associated with expertise along with changes in neural response properties that can be recorded from individual neurons while these same tasks are being carried out. Changes in larger-scale neural response are also hotly debated, and we are investigating how EEG signals track increasing familiarity of learned images.<br /><br />As we gain expertise with a new class of visual objects, our facility with instances of that class changes - we become better able to discriminate between individual exemplars, and we are less able to focus exclusively on isolated parts. We are studying how the parts that make up an object are used to identify the object, and how the neural representations of those parts come together to form a representation of the whole. Do these processes depend on our familiarity with the objects in question, or with the object classes? Are there particular kinds of objects, such as faces, that have specific dedicated modes of processing?<br /><br />By simultaneously recording from multiple neurons in actively behaving subjects, we hope to understand which neural features show a quantitative variation that parallels ability. Subjects perform classification tasks relying on conjunctions of visual stimuli; behavioral measures indicate learning of these conjunctions and when they are treated as configurations versus new whole objects. We record from inferotemporal neurons and use these data to develop and evaluate statistical methods for understanding how it is that we "know" when two objects "go together" - the binding problem. Are the joint firing statistics of two inferotemporal neurons respectively selective for two stimuli more informative for predicting grouping status than each neuron considered independently?<br /><br />To directly test possible causal effects of neural activity in parts of the ventral visual pathway on perceptual decisions and looking behavior, we are testing effects of stimulation of small populations of these cells. By carefully controlling the timing and duration of stimulation, we seek to demonstrate the role that cells in inferotemporal cortex play in forming perceptual decisions about the structure of visual objects or the presence of known objects in complex environments.'

S"My research focuses on social abilities in young children with autism and children at risk for poor social developmental outcomes. I also study the effects of prenatal drug exposure on regulatory abilities, and am investigating the degree to which individual differences in regulatory capacities predict developmental outcomes. Current projects include studies of joint attention and cardiac psychophysiology in children with autism and children with prenatal drug exposure, and the effects of prenatal cocaine on brain development. My research has focused on the development of social and communication abilities in young children. My research has included children with autism spectrum disorders as well as children at risk due to biosocial risk factors such as poverty and prenatal drug exposure. On one level this research asks substantive clinical questions related to the populations, including research that is related to the early presentation (and thus early screening and diagnosis) of autism and research examining the impact of biosocial risks on the development of social and communication development. However, on another level, my research seeks to identify influences on individual differences in social and behavioral outcomes in these populations. Thus, this research is in the model of developmental psychopathology, for it seeks to not only better describe the development of specific populations, but also utilizes findings from these special populations as a means to model factors that affect children with typical development. <br /><br />STUDIES OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM<br />1. Joint Attention in Autism: It has long been recognized that children with autism are far less likely than other children to engage in joint attention (social communication that allows children to jointly attend to interests and events). The roots of this deficit are far less understood.  We are investigating whether individual differences in biobehavioral responses to social events predicts individual differences in joint attention and other social behaviors in autism. Whereas one theory states that joint attention deficits reflect a social cognitive delay in autism, our hypothesis is that deficits in joint attention reflect deficits in social connectedness.<br /><br />2. Psychophysiology in Autism: An additional controversy in autism is whether the disorder, which affects the ability and propensity of children to initiate and engage in social interactions with others, reflects a disturbance in social approach tendencies (as alluded to above), or whether the disorder is secondary to an aversion to social interactions. In our research, we utilize measures of both behavior and physiology to characterize the responses of children with autism to different types of social events. Currently, we are investigating the responses of children to social events that differ in their degree of intensity and intrusiveness. Our hypothesis is that children with autism will be hyporeactive to social events that are non-intrusive, whereas they may be hyper-reactive to more intrusive social events.  <br /><br />STUDIES OF CHILDREN WITH PRENATAL DRUG EXPOSURE<br />1. Joint Attention in Prenatal Drug Exposure: While (as described above) autism affects the development of joint attention, pre- and postnatal risk factors may affect the development of this important social-developmental milestone as well. Thus, we are investigating the effects of prenatal drug exposure (specifically, cocaine and methamphetamine) on the development of joint attention and other social communication abilities. In order to address this question, we are investigating joint attention behaviors in two large longitudinal studies of prenatal drug exposure, the Maternal Lifestyle Study (prenatal cocaine) and the IDEAL study (prenatal methamphetamine). These data sets will also allow for complex modeling of the determinants of individual differences in joint attention, as well as the impact of joint attention on the later development social and communication abilities in these populations. <br /><br />2. Psychophysiologic Studies of Prenatal Drug Exposure:  Prenatal drug exposure, and the postnatal environmental risks that go along with prenatal drug exposure, are likely to affect the development of children's ability to regulate their internal state in the face of stress and challenge. As part of the Maternal Lifestyle Study, we are investigating the impact of prenatal cocaine exposure on the development of cardiorespiratory regulation and reactivity. We are particularly interested in the use of measures of heart rate variability as an index of central regulatory capacity and are studying the impact of prenatal cocaine on the development of such cardiac measures. In addition, we are investigating whether individual differences in cardiorespiratory regulation are predictors of developmental outcomes. As part of this area of research, we are investigating whether children with better-developed regulatory capacity are buffered against the cumulative impact of multiple biosocial risks.<br /><br />3. Functional Neuroimaging: Related to the issue of prenatal cocaine's effect on the development of regulatory capacity, we have begun an investigation of the impact of prenatal cocaine on brain development. Here we are focusing on the development of brain systems related to the cognitive control of attention and inhibition. We have utilized functional MRI to study whether children with prenatal cocaine exposure differ in brain functioning during tasks requiring response inhibition."

S"Professor Shu's research activities are concentrated on the design,<br />analysis, implementation and application of high order nonlinearly<br />stable numerical schemes for solving convection dominated partial<br />differential equations.<br /><br />One major type of such schemes is the class of WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) finite difference and finite volume<br />schemes.  These are schemes with solutions which are high order <br />accurate in smooth regions and at the same time produce sharp and<br />non-oscillatory shock transitions.  They are especially suitable<br />for solving problems with both strong discontinuities and complex<br />smooth regions structures, such as the problem of shock interacting with turbulence.  Recent development in WENO schemes include the technique to handle negative linear weights, the design of WENO schemes for conservation laws and Hamilton-Jacobi equations on arbitrary unstructured meshes, multi-domain finite difference WENO schemes, Hermite type WENO schemes, anti-diffusive corrections to WENO schemes to sharpen contact discontinuities, well-balanced WENO schemes, and residual distribution finite difference WENO schemes for steady state problems on nonsmooth meshes.  Recent applications of WENO schemes include the simulation for the Boltzmann-Poisson system in semiconductor device simulations in one and two spatial dimensions and in two and three phase space dimensions, particle-fluid two phase flow problems, cosmology in astrophysics, high Mach number astrophysical jets with radiative cooling, nearly-incompressible, inviscid Taylor-Green vortex flow, shallow water equations, hyperbolic models for chemosensitive movement, multi-stage interaction of a shock wave and a strong vortex, multi-class traffic flow models, shock mitigation and drag reduction by pulsed energy lines, low-redshift cosmic baryon fluid on large scales, and Rayleigh-Taylor instability. <br /><br />Another major type of such schemes is the class of discontinuous<br />Galerkin (DG) methods.  These are finite element methods but with<br />important features borrowed from high resolution finite volume<br />methodology, such as exact or approximate Riemann solvers as<br />numerical fluxes, limiters to control spurious oscillations, and<br />strong stability, preserving high order Runge-Kutta time<br />discretizations.  The major advantages of the discontinuous Galerkin<br />method include its local conservation, compact data communication<br />and subsequent high parallel efficiency, flexibility of arbitrary<br />h-p adaptivity while keeping nonlinear stability, and provable<br />stability and error estimates for many complicated nonlinear<br />convection dominated PDEs.  Recent development in DG methods<br />include the design of local discontinuous Galerkin methods for<br />nonlinear wave equations involving higher spatial derivatives,<br />such as the KdV type equations, the nonlinear Schroedinger<br />equations, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations and the Ito-type <br />coupled KdV equations, and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili and the <br />Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations, the design of WENO and Hermite<br />WENO limiters for discontinuous Galerkin method, the post-processing <br />technique to enhance the order of accuracy, the design of<br />discontinuous Galerkin method for Hamilton-Jacobi equations,<br />the analysis of the discontinuous Galerkin and related methods<br />such as the spectral finite volume method, the design of locally divergence-free discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Maxwell and MHD equations and in general structure preserving discontinuous Galerkin methods, error estimates for fully discrete Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method for nonlinear conservation law systems and for other nonlinear wave equations for smooth solutions, and the design of discontinuous Galerkin method based on non-polynomial approximation spaces.  Recent applications of the discontinuous Galerkin method include aeroacoustic simulations, Maxwell equations and MHD, compactons, moment models in semiconductor device simulations, and shallow water equations.<br /><br />Related research has also been performed in multi-scale methods,<br />spectral methods for discontinuous problems with the emphasis on<br />accuracy recovery techniques, Lax-Wendroff type time discretizations,<br />and stable high resolution schemes for a hierarchical size-structured <br />model in computational biology."

S'Leila Sievanen is an environmental anthropologist whose research interests broadly include the topics of biodiversity conservation and international development, people-park interactions, and the material and symbolic ways in which the natural world is understood, produced, and contested. She received NSF and Fulbright funding to conduct dissertation research on factors related to why government officials, communities, and individuals responded in the way that they did to marine environmental policies in a national park in Indonesia. This research was related to her participation in a multi-disciplinary team researching factors related to coral reef conservation sustainability in Southeast Asia. In the US, she has worked at NOAA/Northwest Fisheries Science Center to help define an anthropological research agenda for marine protected areas and fisheries management. She is currently comparing how social, cultural, and ecological context influences ecosystem-based management practices in Mexico, the US, and the Western Pacific.'

S'\tMy research goals are to determine the effects of aging on the pathways of amyloid removal (clearance) from the brain. The accumulation of amyloid, a sticky protein composed of amyloid-beta peptides (A&#946;), appears to be the cause of Alzheimer\xe2\x80&#153;s disease (AD). Age is the primary risk factor for developing AD, so it is critical to assess the effects of aging on clearance of A&#946; from the extra cellular fluid space (ISF) of the brain. Clearance of A&#946; from the brain occurs via two major pathways: the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation and transport from the ISF into the blood stream directly across the brain capillaries. There are two transporters known that affect A&#946; concentration in the ISF. The low density lipoprotein-related protein-1 (LRP-1) transports A&#946; out of the ISF and into the plasma. The receptor for advanced glycated end-products (RAGE) transports A&#946; from the plasma into the ISF. We postulate that age-related changes in the CSF circulation and in the BBB account for the inability to clear A&#946; from the brain in aging and in the age-related dementias. We are examining these age-related changes in a model of aging provided by the Brown-Norway rat, an animal now available at 10, 20 and 30+ months of age, corresponding to early adult, middle age and aged in humans. Measurement of CSF production and CSF volume will yield the turnover rate of CSF at each age group. Studies of the choroid plexus, the main site of CSF production, as a function of aging will help determine the cause of diminished CSF turnover. Imunostaining of A&#946;, LRP-1 and RAGE along with RT-PCR and Western blotting  will determine if aging affects the expression of these receptors on the capillary endothelium and if these changes correlate with amyloid deposition.

She is also writing and publishing essays on contemporary Portuguese and lusophone African literature, also framed by the theoretical approach summarily described above. Some of her most recent papers (all forthcoming) may illustrate a hermeneutic reading that pays particular attention to an alleged nexus between emotions and literature: "The narrator\'s mediation and the readers\'s affective response in Jos&#233; Saramago\'s Levantado do Ch&#227;o"; "Teias emocionais em torno de identidades perdidas n\' A Costa dos Murm&#250;rios"; and "Germano Almeida y el filtro de los afectos en la transfiguraci&#243;n de lo real en A Ilha Fant&#225;stica."'

S'Dr. Leonor Simas-Almeida was born in Lisbon, Portugal, where in 1975 she received a B. A. in Portuguese Literature and in 1979 a "Licenciatura" in Romance Philology. For fourteen years she taught in Portugal. In 1989 she was sent by ICALP (currently "Instituto Cam&#245;es") to Brown University to teach Portuguese language and culture. At Brown, she received an M.A (1999) and a PhD (2004) in Comparative Literature. From 1989 to the present, she has been teaching courses in Portuguese language, culture and literature and, more recently, in Lusophone African Literature at the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies. Dr. Simas-Almeida\'s teaching and research cover different periods and different genres of Portuguese literature. However, her work is more particularly centered on narrative fiction and, lately, it has been reflecting a strong interest in the cognitive role of emotions in literary analysis. Having started by applying her focus on "intelligent emotions" to 19th century narrative and to comparative literature (her primary field of scholarship), she has extended her theoretical approach both to 20th century Portuguese fiction and to African lusophone literature. Literary translation is another area of special interest for Dr. Simas-Almeida who has published translations of essays and short stories from English into French and, for the most part, from English into Portuguese.'

S'I\'m interested in understanding how the bat\'s sonar works and how the bat\'s brain makes sonar images. They make sounds, listen to echoes, and then see objects. To study echolocation, we go into the field and videotape bats using sonar for different purposes. These observations tell us in what situations bats use their sonar, and what sorts of sounds they use. If we know where the objects are in the videos, we can figure out what sounds get back to the bats. We then use a computer to generate these sounds and play them to the bats while we record responses from their brains. We want to know what the neurons in the bat\'s auditory system do to process the echoes to allow the brain to see. We also train bats in the lab to respond to computer-generated echoes, so we can tell something about the images the bat perceives. We are developing a computer model of how the bat\'s brain processes the echoes to see if the model produces the same kind of images the bat perceives. This model is part of a project to design new high-performance sonar for the U.S. Navy.<br /><br />My laboratory studies the biological sonar, or echolocation, of bats as  an auditory imaging system. The research uses behavioral, neurophysiological / neuroanatomical, and modeling techniques to learn how bats process echoes  of their ultrasonic sonar transmissions to perceive the location and identity  of the flying insects they prey upon. The approach is a combination of neuroethology  and systems neurobiology, with sonar signal-processing as a theoretical tool.  Currently, we are carrying out experiments on target ranging by the big brown  bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to characterize the images bats perceive along the dimension of echo delay or target distance. Eptesicus transmits frequency-modulated  (FM) sonar sounds and perceives the delay of echoes from the timing of neural  discharges they evoke in the auditory system. The bat perceives the shape  of targets from the spectrum of echoes, but the images themselves consist  of a reconstruction of the differences in range to the different parts of the target (for example, an insect\'s head and wing). Thus, the image has echo delay as its primary dimension, both for determining how far targets  are from the bat and for determining their shape. The auditory cortex of  Eptesicus appears to carry out the neural computations that transform the  echo spectrum into estimates of the distance to the different parts of the  target, and we are currently investigating the response properties of cortical  neurons in relation to the delay and spectrum of FM echoes. This problem is of considerable theoretical interest because the bat carries out parallel time-domain and frequency-domain transforms to form its images of targets.  We use a large-scale parallel, distributed model of the bat\'s sonar  receiver to identify critical parameters of neural responses that are relevant for carrying out these transforms, and then we record the responses of cortical neurons to sonar signals and echoes as a means of evaluating the model.<br /><br />Lab Website: <br /><a href="http://neuroscience.brown.edu/simmonslab/">neuroscience.brown.edu/simmonslab/</a>'

Eptesicus is a species that emits ultrasonic, frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation sounds and exhibits unusually sophisticated real-time signal-processing techniques for auditory representation of FM echoes.  I am interested in orientation by echolocation and the neural mecha&#172;nisms for perception by acoustic images that have evolved in bats, especially FM bats because the theoretical basis for understanding the bat\'s performance is made unusually strong by the large applied-math literature on radar and sonar receivers.  The principal goal of my work is to learn how echolocation "works"&#151;to understand how natural images are created in perception from neural reconstruction of the target scene by the bat\'s brain.<br /><br />Lab Website:<br /><a href="http://neuroscience.brown.edu/simmonslab/">neuroscience.brown.edu/simmonslab/</a>'

Her appointment was approved unanimously by the Corporation of Brown University during a special session at 1 p.m. today (Thursday, Nov. 9, 2000). Simmons will begin her duties July 1, 2001.<br /><br /><br />PROVIDENCE, R.I. \x97 During a special meeting at 1 p.m. today (Thursday, Nov. 9, 2000), the Corporation of Brown University unanimously elected Ruth J. Simmons as the 18th president of Brown University.<br /><br /><br />Simmons, who has been president of Smith College in Northampton, Mass., since 1995, will be the first African American to lead an Ivy League institution. She succeeds E. Gordon Gee, now chancellor of Vanderbilt University.<br /><br /><br />The Corporation&#146;s vote today ended a nine-month national search conducted by a selection committee of the Corporation and a campus advisory committee of students, faculty and staff. The committees sought recommendations and nominations from a broad cross-section of the Brown community and reviewed materials from hundreds of applicants.<br /><br /><br />&#147;Ruth Simmons is a gifted academic leader with impressive accomplishments in areas of particular importance to Brown: institutional diversity, collaborative research and learning initiatives, faculty support and minority faculty recruitment, undergraduate scholarships, and a deep appreciation for fundamental personal values,&#148; said Brown Chancellor Stephen Robert, who introduced Simmons to the trustees and fellows following the Corporation&#146;s vote. &#147;We have selected an extraordinary leader, a person of character, of integrity, and of depth. I believe the broader campus community will welcome Dr. Simmons with great enthusiasm.&#148;<br /><br /><br />&#147;I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead this outstanding University in this exciting time in history,&#148; Simmons said. &#147;It gives me enormous pride and joy to think that I will serve as president of an institution that not only has ideals I can share, but also earnestly seeks to live those ideals.&#148;<br /><br /><br />Interim President Sheila E. Blumstein, who has led the University since February, will continue in office for the remainder of the current academic year. Simmons will take up her duties as Brown&#146;s president July 1, 2001. She will also have a tenured faculty appointment as professor of comparative literature. Blumstein, the Albert D. Mead Professor of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, will return to full-time teaching and research.<br /><br /><br />&#147;Brown owes President Blumstein a tremendous debt of gratitude,&#148; Robert said. &#147;She has answered the University&#146;s call twice in the last five years, as interim provost and interim president. President-elect Simmons will find a university that is energized and moving forward on significant projects from capital improvements to need-blind admission.&#148;<br /><br /><br />Simmons&#146; rise to the Brown presidency has been an extraordinary accomplishment. The 12th child born to sharecroppers in the small East Texas town of Grapeland, Simmons moved with her family to Houston when she was of school age. There her father found employment as a factory worker and her mother worked as a maid; Simmons entered public school. She has written thoughtfully about those years in an autobiographical essay, &#147;My Mother&#146;s Daughter: Lessons I Learned in Civility and Authenticity,&#148; published in the Texas Journal of Ideas, History and Culture (fall/winter 1998).<br /><br /><br />With strong family and community support, Simmons continued her education, earning her bachelor&#146;s degree summa cum laude at Dillard University in New Orleans (1967) and her master&#146;s and doctorate in Romance languages and literatures at Harvard University (1970 and 1973). Her effort to understand how her own society could countenance racial cruelty and legally enforced segregation led her to a lifelong interest in humanities and other cultures. She studied in Mexico and France and later served as an interpreter for the U.S. State Department.<br /><br /><br />Simmons began her academic career at the University of New Orleans as an assistant professor of French and later served as assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts. She moved to California State University in Northridge in 1977 as visiting associate professor of pan-African studies and acting director of international programs. From 1979 to 1983, she was assistant and later associate dean of graduate studies at the University of Southern California.<br /><br /><br />In 1983 she returned to the East Coast, settling at Princeton University, where she directed Afro-American studies and rose to become associate dean of the faculty. After two years as provost at Spelman College in Atlanta, Simmons returned to Princeton as vice provost, a position she held until her move to Smith in 1995.<br /><br /><br />Simmons has worked tirelessly toward opening higher education \x96 particularly elite private institutions \x96 to disadvantaged minorities, a mission she has described as &#147;a matter of national salvation.&#148; At Smith, she established the nation&#146;s first engineering program at a women&#146;s college and started Meridians, a journal focusing on the concerns of minority women. Her achievements in higher education have brought her dozens of honors and awards including Danforth and Fulbright fellowships and nine honorary doctorates.'

What does this variation reveal about the mechanisms governing genome evolution, and to what extent does it contribute to organismal fitness? How do ecological parameters interact with evolutionary forces such as mutation, recombination, migration, and selection in establishing patterns of variation? To what extent are patterns replicated, and which develop stochastically?<br><br />Metagenomics, which refers to the study of genomic sequence obtained from a mixed population, is a powerful tool to address these questions. It has provided significant insights into the structure and function of microbes in the environment, but to date, most metagenomic studies of microbial communities have collected snapshots of data at a particular point in space and time.

S"My research area focuses on varied problems in applied non-linear dynamics.  I am particularly interested in computational biology and genomics as well as ideas concerning the measure theoretic properties of dynamical systems.<br /><br />I am currently involved in research in two different areas:<br /><br />Genome Assembly: The first is a interdisciplinary group working on improving the process for determining the genome of an organism. This project has involved working with students and professors at the University of Maryland from the mathematics, computer science, physics and biology programs. We have also collaborated with experts at the Institute for Genomic Research and the Baylor College of Medicine. <br /><br />Fractal Basin Boundaries: My interest in the dynamical systems was what interested me in pursuing an advanced degree in applied mathematics. In this project I worked to understand some of the more recent ideas in the structure of basins of attraction of low dimensional maps.  <br /><br />Repetitive Regions in DNA:<br /><br />The genome or DNA sequence of an organism is a sequence of nucleic acids represented by letters from the alphabet {A,C,G,T}. The length of this sequence varies from several million letters in types of bacteria to several billions in a mammalian genome.While genomes have been obtained for a variety of organisms, including fruit fly, worm and rat, there is still much to be learned about the properties of the genome itself. Repeat regions, sequences that occur repeatedly throughout the genome, are an area of significant interest.<br /><br />Since DNA sequences come from a small alphabet we expect to see subsequences that occur more that once; for example if a DNA sequence is longer than (4k+k+1) letters for some positive integer k, by the Pigeon Hole Principle there will be at least one repeated k length subsequence. However there are substantially longer sequences that appear far more often than chance would allow in DNA. These repeated regions of DNA have been the focus of my research.<br />The concept of a repetitive region in a genome is difficult to precisely define. Repeat regions can occur many times in a genome and distinct copies have differences between them. Papers on repetitive DNA tend to be vague when discussing what constitutes a repeat region.<br /><br />I began my research by addressing this problem through providing a quantification of repeat regions that is well defined for an arbitrary DNA sequence. Let us define a repeat string S to be a subsequence of DNA where, for some fixed n, every n-letter word in S occurs at least twice in a genome. I have investigated the structure of repeat strings in the genomes of C. elegans (a worm) and Arabidopsis (a plant). I have found a surprising power law structure in the distribution of lengths of repeat strings. <br /><br />I have used several simple models of evolution of repeat strings in the genome and found the that underlying power law structure will emerge as the stationary distribution of this evolutionary process.<br />Symbolic Dynamical System for Reconstructing Repetitive DNA:<br />The process of determining the DNA sequence of an organism, called genome assembly, remains extremely expensive and the process is far from perfected. The initial draft of the Human Genome took a decade to develop and cost many billions of dollars. In order for sequencing the genome of individual organisms to be viable, the process of genome assembly must be substantially improved.<br /><br />The main algorithmic complication in genome assembly is the presence of highly repetitive DNA. Unfortunately repetitive DNA can make up a significant portion of the genome of an organism. For example, nearly 50% of the human genome is expected to be repetitive.<br />The goal of my work in genome assembly was to use information present to construct what we call consensus copies of repetitive regions. I create a symbolic dynamical systems algorithm on a graph whose nodes are k-letter words from the DNA alphabet. A trajectory of our dynamical system is a string that hopefully corresponds to a repeat string in our genome.<br /><br />I've tested my method for constructing consensus copies of repeat strings using data from several species including fruit fly, rat, chicken and mosquito. I am currently looking at developing software to assemble these regions that could be provided to the genome assembly community.<br /><br />Wada Basins in One-Dimensional Maps:<br />In dynamical systems with more than one co-existing attractor the basins of attraction can become entangled in such a way that the boundary of all basins coincides. A special type of entangled basin boundaries is that of a Wada Basin, where every point on the boundary of the basin is also a boundary point of three attractors. Such phenomena have been show to occur in many physical systems such as a forced damped pendulum and forced Duffing Oscillator. <br /><br />Additionally, under certain conditions Wada Basins also exist in One-Dimensional Maps. Wada Basins have been shown to emerge from tangent bifurcation when there are three co-existing attracting fixed points and particular conditions are met. My hope is to work toward extending these results on the emergence of Wada Basins to periodic points of arbitrary period and to higher dimensional systems."

S'Steven Sloman\'s research focuses on causal reasoning, decision-making, and categorization. He is concerned with the cognitive processes underlying inductive inference. How are people able, despite limited knowledge and experience, to adapt and reason in a world that is constantly changing? His main approach is to experimentally test formal models of decision making, reasoning and judgment.  One set of issues Sloman studies concerns how people reason about cause.  We draw causal inferences every time we make a decision because we have to reason about the consequences of the options available to us.  Causation is special because all knowledge may be structured around our understanding of causal mechanism. Yet, causal relations cannot directly be observed and seem to require an assessment of counterfactuals, events that have not actually occurred. (Simplifying, if A causes B, then B wouldn\'t have occurred if A hadn\'t, even if A did occur.) <br /><br />Ongoing research examines the viability of formal, probabilistic models of causal and counterfactual inference and induction. One focus concerns people\'s sensitivity to the distinction between observation and action. Through action, people can run mini-experiments that might afford causal inference.  <br /><br />Sloman also studies several issues of categorization. First, do people have fixed categories of things in their heads or are categories completely determined by specific categorization tasks? For example, how well do the categories we use to name things correspond to the categories we use to induce the properties of things? Second, what are the "core" or central properties of an object and what makes them so important? The answer may have something to do with the causal activities that we engage in with the object.  <br /><br />Sloman also studies judgments of confidence and probability. The goal in this research is to understand the principles of coherence that underlie our beliefs. What makes evidence seem consistent with an hypothesis? In what sense and to what degree do our judgments have a rational basis?'

Her continuing interests have been with theories relating to aesthetics, language, and human cognition and with issues of disciplinarity as such.<br /><br />Smith's first authored book, <i>Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End</i> (Chicago UP, 1968), concerned the relation between poetic structure and perception. Two subsequent books, <i>On the Margins of Discourse: The Relation of Language and Literature</i> (Chicago UP, 1978) and <i>Contingencies of Value: Alternative Perspectives for Critical Theory</i> (Harvard UP, 1988) developed theories of, respectively, literary language and literary value. <br /><br />Her more recent research, since the early 1990s, falls in the fields of 20th-century intellectual history and contemporary science studies. She has been especially concerned with the new conceptions of knowledge and science emerging since the 1930s from fields such as the history, sociology and philosophy of science. She has also been interested in the changing &#150; and often conflicting &#150; intellectual and institutional relations between the sciences and the humanities. These interests are reflected in two recent books, <i>Belief and Resistance: Dynamics of Intellectual Controversy</i> (Harvard UP, 1997) and <i>Scandalous Knowledge: Science, Truth and the Human</i> (Edinburgh UP, 2005; Duke UP, 2006).<br /><br />Smith's latest book, <i>Natural Reflections: Human Cognition at the Nexus of Science and Religion</i> (Yale UP, 2009), is based on the Terry Lectures that she gave at Yale University in 2006. Here she describes and assesses a set of contemporary intellectual projects involving science, religion and human cognition."

S'Broadly, Professor Smith\'s research focuses on understanding the intersection of social change and social reproduction, particularly as it unfolds in population processes and health-related behavior. Completed research projects have investigated the influence of migration on family organization and reproductive behavior as people live across rural-urban boundaries. Smith has also studied the effects of rural-urban migration on sexual behavior and HIV risk among adolescents and unmarried young adults. He led the Nigeria component of an NIH-supported, five-country comparative ethnographic study entitled "Love, Marriage, and HIV."  The research examined the changing expectations and pragmatics of modern marriage, documenting and analyzing the organization and opportunity structures of extramarital relationships, investigating how gender is configured in contemporary sexual and romantic relationships, and evaluating the effect of these patterns on the transmission of HIV. In addition to elucidating the cultural context of HIV transmission in the five countries, the study design represented a methodological renewal of anthropology\'s comparative orientation, employing a shared ethnographic methodology to investigate social, demographic, and health processes across five societies. The research culmiated in a recent book, <i>The Secret: Love, Marriage, and HIV</i> (2009), co-authored with colleagues on the project. Currently, Professor Smith is finishing a new book about inequality, morality, and social change in Nigeria, using popular responses to the AIDS epidemic as a prism to understand wider transformations.<br /><br />Smith\'s research on political culture focuses on understanding the intersection of social imagination, politics, and contemporary issues in Nigeria, including democracy and developemnt, vigilantism, and corruption. His first book, <i>A Culture of Corruption: Everyday Deception and Popular Discontent in Nigeria</i>, for which he received the 2008 Margaret Mead Award, examines ordinary Nigerians\' participation in corruption, even as they are, paradoxically, its main victims and its loudest critics. A new research project explores the growing popularity and wider social impact of Pentecostal Christianity in southeastern Nigeria.'

The unifying theme of my research is the study of Conservation Medicine - an emerging interdisciplinary field that studies the link between anthropogenic environmental change, the health of all species, and the conservation of biodiversity. Within the purview of Conservation Medicine I am interested in three research topics: 1) the effects of disease on biodiversity, 2) the role of invasive species in disease emergence, and 3) the scope, implications and regulation of global wildlife trade. My principal approach in exploring these topics has been to test hypotheses using a combination of meta-analyses, theory and field studies.'

S'Web Research <br /><br />Funded by the NSF for more than $500,000 with a range of smaller grants, principally from the Lemelson Center at the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution, this interdisciplinary curriculum project brought together middle and high school teachers with historians of technology and resulted in three units of a multi-unit curriculum being posted on-line (with the help of the Center for Children and Technology) as "Whole Cloth: Discovering American History Through Sicence and Technology".  <br /><br />As part of the Brown-Tougaloo Cooperative Exchange, begun in 1964, a group of Brown and Tougaloo faculty, staff and students examined the freedom movement on the Tougaloo College campus in Jackson Mississippi, and the intertwined histories of the Northern, elite University and the Southern, historically Black College.  The students located and scanned documents on both campuses and wrote about their research.  The Scholarly Technology Group at Brown provided the scaffolding and the web design. The Ford Foundation, along with various Brown offices, gave funding.  The resulting website ("Freedom Now!") sits at the intersection between faculty research and teaching, and gives the Tougaloo and Brown communities insight into their histories.  <br /><br />With the Brown University Library\'s Center for Digital Initiatives, Smulyan has begun work on new website that centers around an anonymous Japanese scroll (held in the John Hay library at Brown) which features twelve images of Commodore Matthew Perry\'s first landing in Japan.  "Perry Visits Japan" uses student reactions to the images to explore the use of visual material as historical evidence and the cultural differences that come into play with such interpretations.  We hope to work with colleagues in Japan to have Japanese students post their impressions of the same images.'

Some of the authors that will be examined are Lessing, Kant, Hoelderlin, Kleist, Wordsworth, Adam Smith, Walter Benjamin, and Martin Heidegger.  <br /><br />He has also led a graduate seminar in Summer 2010 at the University of Konstanz on the topic of community, and is working on co-organizing a conference around that topic.'

S'I study how children represent and learn new pieces of causal knowledge and come to acquire their "folk" or commonsense understanding of the world. My specific research endeavors include: (1) how children use general cognitive mechanisms and specific pieces of developing knowledge to make predictions, generate explanations, and engage in counterfactual inference; (2) how children integrate social information into these processes (e.g., others\' history of generating accurate information or the intentionality behind their actions); 3) the role that discovery plays in causal learning, inference, and hypothesis formation; and (4) how children understand various mental states like pretending, learning, and intentionality. My lab investigates these questions using mostly behavioral approaches, but my work is often inspired by computational modeling and links to cognitive neuroscience and education. Almost all of the research in the lab is on toddlers and preschoolers. We investigate this age because these children have less existing knowledge and no experience with formal schooling. This allows us to describe their reasoning and learning abilities as well as how they construct their knowledge. We collaborate with the Providence Children\'s Museum via a program called MINDLab, which allows us to perform research and outreach with children at the Museum, but we also have a thriving lab environment that utilizes a variety of empirical methods. The lab has been funded by NSF, NIH, and the Dana foundation.'

S'Dr. Spirito has been conducting research in adolescent suicidality and depression for 25 years. Most recently, he has focused his efforts on treatment. Working with a postdoctoral fellow, he published the first randomized trial of individual therapy with adolescents who attempt suicide. He also conducted an intervention trial designed to improve treatment attendance in this population. He was also site CBT supervisor for a large multisite study, "The Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescence". He currently is conducting treatment development studies to determine if new approaches will increase the efficacy of depression treatments for adolescents. The first trial is examining whether concurrently treating the depressed parent of a depressed teen will improve outcomes for the adolescent. The second study is examining whether the addition of an exercise component to a CBT protocol will improve depression outcomes in overweight adolescents treated with CBT.  And the third trial is testing an integrated approach for treating conduct problems in depressed adolescents.<br /><br />With respect to alcohol and substance use treatment research, he has used individual motivational interventions with adolescents who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an alcohol-related admission.  In an extension of the original work, he broadened the scope of the brief intervention to include a parent motivational intervention. He currently is using this parent motivational approach, the Family Check-Up, with families who have teenage siblings in which one has been identified after an alcohol-related incident. He has also modified the Family Check-Up for a protocol designed to prevent the onset of substance use in middle schoolers receiving mental health treatment.  He is currently using both an individual adolescent motivational interview and the Family Check-up to address marijuana, sexual risk behavior, and school attendance in high school students who are truant from school.  He is also developing and testing an alcohol prevention program with middle schoolers being treated in the ED for an injury.<br /><br />With respect to combined treatments for depression, suicidality, and alcohol/drug use, he collaborated on a study of an integrated CBT protocol for adolescents with alcohol use disorders, MDD, and suicidality.  For his midcareer K award, he has transported this integrated protocol to the community and has been instructing licensed mental health counselors to use the protocol for the past two years.'

S"Cassandra Stanton's program of research is focused on promoting pediatric health to prevent the uptake of health-compromising behaviors, such as smoking, and ultimately reduce the risk of developing cancers and other chronic diseases.  These research activities encompass developing, testing, and refining etiologic multilevel models that focus on how contextual influences in the social environments of youth interact with family and intrapersonal factors to protect children and adolescents from the uptake of smoking behaviors.  Preventing smoking uptake among youth has been identified as essential to public health efforts to reduce the overall prevalence of smoking and its attendant morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that three-fourths of individuals who smoke daily as high school seniors are still smoking daily eight years later, even though only 5 percent anticipated that they would still be smoking (Johnston et al., 2000). Interventions aimed at reducing adolescent smoking at early stages of uptake could decrease the number of youth who progress from smoking experimentation to regular smoking and likely nicotine dependence.  For such programs to be successful, it is necessary to better understand contextual and social influences at different stages of adolescent smoking.  <br /><br />Another dimension of her research program is a focus on better understanding racial/ethnic differences in health behaviors.  For example, there is a growing literature addressing racial/ethnic differences in health behaviors during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.  Emerging adulthood has been proposed as a new conception of development for the period from the late teens through the twenties, with a focus on ages 18-25.  There is a vast literature on disparities between rates of health promoting behaviors, such as physical activity, and health compromising behaviors, such as cigarette smoking, among adolescents from different races, regions, and cultural contexts. But it is only in recent years that a handful of longitudinal investigations examining trajectories of these behaviors have revealed disparities in how health behaviors change over time among different cultural and contextual subgroups.  Although adolescence and young adulthood are periods often thought to be of peak health, emerging evidence suggests that health promotion efforts aimed at youth transitioning to adulthood and tailored to specific cultural and contextual subgroups are paramount to promoting lifelong health and reducing health outcome disparities.  She is involved in a series or projects utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to further understand health disparities during this critical developmental stage.<br /><br />Cassandra Stanton is also a co-Investigator in Brown's Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center (TTURC-2).  The TTURC builds on data from the New England Family Study (NEFS), which is a three-generation birth cohort of mothers (first-generation) and their children (second-generation) initially recruited in Boston and Providence during the early 1960s.  Over the past several years, she has been involved in collecting data from the third generation of Providence and Boston NEFS children who were assessed (at ages 12-17) as part of Brown's TTURC-1.  We collected data primarily on individual-level characteristics, such as lifetime smoking trajectories, psychosocial history, diagnoses of mental disorders, and physical health. Data from TTURC-1 will serve as the baseline wave for the study (TTURC-2) that is currently underway, which follows these adolescents and their NEFS parent over the next four years, broadening the scope of inquiry to include new information on environmental risk during the emerging adulthood period. <br /><br />Finally, Cassandra Stanton's research activities in cancer prevention include applied work with randomized clinical trials for smoking cessation in medical settings.  As a co-I of a large-scale community based R01 smoking cessation clinical trial, Dr. Stanton is involved with developing and evaluating a clinic-based culturally targeted smoking cessation treatment for a largely low-income, Latino, HIV positive population.  We are comparing a culturally enhanced smoking cessation intervention that incorporates a strong social support component to a standard care control condition in clinics throughout Southern New England."

S'My recently completed dissertation, "A New Education for a Modern Age: National Reform, State-building, and the Transformation of American Schooling, 1890-1933," explores the modernization and nationalization of American public schooling in the early twentieth century.   <br /><br />It argues that reformers transformed schools from local, voluntary supplements for home and community into compulsory, state-controlled institutions of public socialization aimed at preparing future workers and citizens for the challenges of modern life.  Drawing insights from the interdisciplinary social science effort to "bring the state back in," it explores the growth of state authority over local schools and the sometimes hidden ways in which schools served as important new sites for governing children.  I argue that schooling became an important national policy in new ways as the forms and content of the new education were diffused across national space, aided rather than hindered by the persistence of local control and centralization of state authority.  <br /><br />My project explores how reformers envisioned the school as powerful tool for shaping society and molding the individual, investing it with a host of new and sometimes contradictory responsibilities and how the compulsory school became a deliberate but often unacknowledged instrument of state policy and social policing.  I argue that schooling, too often absent in accounts of progressive reform and state-building, was a central way in which Americans confronted and managed the challenges of modernity, particularly tensions between democracy and industrial capitalism.'

S'Biomolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins are the fundamental machinery of life.  Individual biomolecules can now be studied at their natural, molecular length scales using nanofabricated tools such as solid-state nanopores and nanofluidic devices.  These recent advances highlight two important ideas:  First, the behavior of biomolecules on the nanoscale represents an important and largely unexplored regime in which interesting new physics can dominate.  Second, nanostructures can achieve exceptional sensitivity in the study of molecular biophysics that may ultimately revolutionize diagnostic applications.  <br /><br />Our research is focused on developing and implementing new tools for the study of individual biomolecules, while exploring new physics in these nanoscale systems.'

Our project involves contributions from the Brown University Departments of Neuroscience, Education, Summer and Continuing Studies, and the Technology Division of The Education Alliance at Brown in partnership with the Providence Public School District, the East Bay Educational Collaborative, and the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.  <br /><br />We will achieve our goals through a long-term professional development program that addresses the need for high school science reform in Rhode Island.  During the course of this project, 96 high school biology teachers from Rhode Island will be trained in both innovative science content and pedagogical approaches that include inquiry-based methods and active support for improving students' content-area literacy skills.  Fellows commit to a two-year involvement in professional development activities consisting of 147 hours of intensive summer instruction and 84 hours of continued participation during the two academic years.  As teachers gain improved content knowledge as well as teaching effectiveness, their students will be engaged in hands-on experiences in cutting-edge research and will learn to connect science to everyday life.  Mobile lab equipment will be provided along with scientific and pedagogical consultants to allow innovative laboratory exercises to be taught and performed in the high school science classrooms.  The results of year-long scientific inquiry will be presented at an annual symposium held at Brown University in the spring."

S'Suzanne Stewart-Steinberg received her B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology from the University of Essex (United Kingdom) in 1975 with a special focus on comparative political economy and on Antonio Gramsci\'s theories of ideology and the state. She received her Ph.D. from Yale University in the Department of Political Science in 1990. Her doctoral thesis on the problem of ideology in the works of Rousseau, Levi-Strauss, Marx and Freud sought to establish a methodological bridge between the social sciences and literary studies through an interrogation of the relationship between political and literary consent. She earned an M.A. in German Studies from Cornell University with a thesis on the question of consent through the psychoanalytic and cultural-historical lens of masochism. Professor Stewart-Steinberg taught at Cornell University from 1986 until she came to Brown University in 2005 to join both the Department of Italian Studies and the Department of Comparative Literature.<br /><br />Professor Stewart-Steinberg\'s publications include <i>Sublime Surrender: Male Masochism at the Fin-de-Si&#232;cle</i> (Cornell University Press, 1998); and a series of articles on the construction of masculinity in the fin-de-si&#232;cle cultures of Italy and the German-speaking world, in the works of such authors as Wagner, Freud, Matilde Serao, Scipio Sighele and Maria Montessori. <i>The Pinocchio Effect: On Making Italians (1860-1920)</i> was published in 2007 by the University of Chicago Press and was the winner of the MLA\'s Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for best manuscript in Italian Studies. Its Italian translation is scheduled for October 2011. The book interrogates the history of "making Italians" between Italy\'s national Unification and the rise of fascism, through a reading of Collodi\'s <i>Pinocchio</i>, of the works of the inventor of mass psychology Scipio Sighele, the fictional works of Matilde Serao and Edmondo De Amicis, the criminal anthropologist Cesare Lombroso, the debates surrounding the construction of the Italian welfare mother, and the pedagogical works of Maria Montessori. Her third book, entitled "Impious Fidelity: Anna Freud, Psychoanalysis, Politics" will be published by Cornell University Press in November 2011.<br /><br />Professor Stewart-Steinberg\'s current research project deals with the so-called memory wars in contemporary Italy, memory wars that have reopened the problem of Italy\'s fascist past, the ensuing civil war and the birth of the Republic in and as the experience of the Resistance. This book is now tentatively entitled "A History of Italian Repression: Sexuality, Psychoanalysis, and the War against Memory."'

S"Postpartum Sleep Effects on Smoking Relapse &#150; The Rest Assured Study<br /><br />Rates of postpartum smoking relapse are high (70-90%) among women who quit smoking in anticipation of or during pregnancy, despite the fact that relapse is unintentional for a substantial number of these women. In addition to well-established health consequences for smokers, maternal smoking poses health risks for infants, including respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. Standard relapse prevention interventions are not effective for postpartum women. Sleep loss and sleep fragmentation, prevalent for the first 3 months postpartum, may contribute to this problem. Poor sleep is known to diminish stress management skills and behavioral coping and may impact relapse prevention among new mothers through these and other mechanisms.  The primary goals of this project are 1) to measure unique postpartum factors, such as sleep duration and continuity, to see if those factors affect new mothers' ability to stay smoke-free and 2) to develop, refine, and pilot test an integrative smoking relapse prevention intervention for postpartum women called Rest Assured. The long-term objective of this research is to foster postpartum relapse prevention for women with a history of smoking, which, in turn, would improve the overall health of postpartum women and their families."

S'The laboratory under the leadership of Dr. Barbara Stonestreet is focusing on two main focuses:<br /><br />[1] She is the principal investigator on a NIH RO1 proposal entitled:  Cytokines and Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability in the Ovine Fetus. The proposal tests the hypothesis that specific cytokines cross the intact and injured blood-brain barrier in the fetus to damage the brain.  Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the single most important neurologic problem in the perinatal period.  In utero hemodynamic abnormalities possibly in association with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokines) such as IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; predispose to brain injury, particularly in premature neonates.  Systemic cytokines produced during maternal infection and/or increases in cytokines after ischemia may accentuate damage to the fetal brain. The neurovascular unit is a privileged site that consists of brain microvascular endothelium, glia, and neurons.  Although cytokines are known to cross the adult blood-brain barrier (BBB), evidence to support the hypothesis that systemic cytokines cross the BBB of the fetus and premature neonate is sparse.  Our specific aims test the hypothesis that specific cytokines cross both the intact and injured BBB in the fetus to damage the brain.  A consequence of this hypothesis is that blockade of these cytokines would attenuate the ischemia related damage to the neurovascular unit (BBB) and possibly the brain.  A multidisciplinary approach will be used to address our hypothesis and will include physiological, biochemical, pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular methods.  Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that cytokines such as IL-1&#946; & IL-6 cross the BBB in a maturation-dependent manner in ovine fetuses, and that maturation-related changes in barrier permeability to cytokines are primarily related to changes in the composition of the tight junction.  BBB permeability will be quantified by the integral technique with &#945;-aminoisobutyric acid and radiolabeled cytokines.  Tight junction (TJ) proteins and mRNA will be measured by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot.  Aim 2 determines whether ischemic injury increases the permeability of the BBB to cytokines as a function of gestational age and tight junction maturation.  Brain ischemia is induced by carotid occlusion.  BBB permeability and TJ components will be measured as in Aim 1 and brain injury assessed by pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular methods.  Aim 3 determines whether blocking the effects of cytokines with systemic infusions of neutralizing antibodies attenuates ischemic injury to the fetal neurovascular unit (BBB) and possibly the brain more in preterm than near term fetuses.  IL-6 and IL-1 &#946; blocking antibodies will be infused before ischemia.  Brain ischemia will be induced and BBB permeability, TJ components, and brain injury measured as in Aim 2.  These studies will provide the first direct evidence whether systemic cytokines cross the intact or injured fetal BBB and whether blocking the effects of cytokines with neutralizing antibodies protect the fetal neurovascular unit (BBB) and brain.  This project may provide new insights into novel strategies to prevent brain injury in the human fetus and/or premature infant.<br /><br />[2] Hormonal Regulation of Brain Maturation: The importance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in fetal maturation is well known.  Based upon findings that antenatal glucocorticoid treatment reduces blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability early but not late in fetal development, they will continue to examine the effects of steroids on the brain in ovine fetuses, newborns and adults.  The researchers use physiological, biochemical, pathological, immunohistochemical and molecular methods in our studies.  These studies will test the hypothesis that endogenous steroids function as developmental regulators of the BBB via modulation of tight junction protein gene expression at the BBB in the ovine fetus.  Dr. Stonestreet and her colleagues also will test the hypothesis that exogenous steroid treatment accelerates the maturation of the fetal BBB by enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins and mRNA in the BBB via a glucocorticoid receptor mediated mechanism.  Expression of tight junction proteins and mRNA will be measured in brain microvessels by western and northern blot analyses after in vivo treatment of pregnant ewes, lambs and adult sheep with dexamethasone; and after in vitro exposure of brain microvessels to dexamethasone with and without exposure to RU486. <br /><br /> Finally, they will examine the effects of endogenous steroids via fetal adrenalectomy with and without steroid replacement, and exposure to dexamethasone, betamethasone and hydrocortisone on neurons and glia in the fetal/neonatal brain. They will test the hypotheses that endogenous steroids preserve neuronal and glial development, that precocious exposure to exogenous steroids disrupts neuronal and glia development, and that exposure to dexamethasone results in greater damage than exposure to hydrocortisone or betamethasone in the fetal/neonatal brain.'

S'Motion in liquids is an intrinsically complicated business. One might not say the same of gases, which are easily thought of in terms of sharp, well-defined collisions between molecules, or of crystalline solids, where the periodicity of the crystal lattice makes the dynamics almost as simple as that seen in gases. Molecules in liquids, by contrast, are constantly disordered and in a perpetual state of collision, making it difficult to understand processes such as chemical reactions in liquids.<br /><br />What we have been engaged in over the last several years is a theoretical effort to get at the most elementary, short-time, events in liquid dynamics. We have discovered that it is possible to compute what one might call the instantaneous normal modes of a liquid, and that these modes can serve as a powerful entry into the elementary events in liquids. Partitioning these modes into components arising from nearby and distant solvents and from solvent translation and libration, for example, has made it clear that the ultrafast solvation is accomplished most easily in polar solvents by reorienting selected, neighboring, solvent molecules. Moreover, analyzing the important modes for each instantaneous configuration of the liquid has revealed that a sizeable fraction of the prompt dynamics in both nonpolar solvation and vibrational population relaxation arises from a relatively small number of modes -- and that the main function of most of these is to move just a single solvent molecule at a time. It seems, then, that the complexities of liquid dynamics do indeed begin to disappear at short times. Our group is actively engaged in pursuing the spectroscopic consequences of these findings.<br /><br />In parallel with this effort, we have begun to look at a variety of nonlinear ultrafast spectroscopies to see if having an insight into the organization of liquid motion helps us understand the molecular lessons of these new spectroscopies. Optical-Kerr-effect spectroscopy of liquids can, in principle, measure the very intermolecular vibrations that we have been studying, and two-dimensional ("fifth-order") Raman spectroscopy even has the potential to look directly at the coherence of these vibrations. But can we tease out of these spectra any of the genuinely microscopic information that we want? We are working with these and other kinds of novel spectroscopies trying to ascertain what each kind of measurement reveals about liquid dynamics.'

With the advent of ultrafast lasers has come the ability to look at times short enough that the painful complications have barely begun to set in. Our own work has been focused on developing a theoretical understanding of this ultrafast dynamics.  In particular, we are hoping to discern the molecular mechanisms of events such as solvation and vibrational relaxation -- the elementary steps that determine the course of chemical reactions in liquids.'

The book will be titled: "Islam Emplaced: The landscape of an emerging religious tradition." <br /><br />Most recently (Summer 2010) I have served as field director for the Brown University Petra Archaeological Project (BUPAP) under the overall direction of Dr. Susan Alcock. Within that framework I am developing an Islamic Period Petra Initiative that will bring much of the data that we will be collecting for the later periods of the site (post 7th c.) into a synthetic archaeological study of the region that does not follow rigid political temporalities but looks to expand forward and backwards what constitutes an Islamic history.<br /><br />Another archaeological project, currently on the back-burner, will examine the transformations to the fertile Egyptian region of the Fayyum located about one hour south of Cairo. Here I am putting together a team of researches to examine a 13th century irrigation wall that was instrumental in the agricultural and political revitalization of this region under the Mamluk Sultanate. <br /><br />The broader theme of my work has been to understand the role of material culture in human societies. This has prompted me to form the Material Worlds working group at Brown that has brought together and interdisciplinary set of faculty members whose work focus on these issues. Supported by a grant from the Cogut Center for the Humanities we will continue to raise the profile of how things shape our lives through various campus events and developing new curricula. This has lead to my own particular interest in researching how Muslim thinkers understood the made world and what effects these discourses of the material had on the practical formations of the archaeological record. This has become most apparent in things such as the built environment and hence my research has concentrated on everything from ceramic scatters in fields, to walls to the cities of the Muslim world.<br /><br />Information on my current research projects are available <a href="http://research.brown.edu/research/profile.php?id=1204045179&r=1"> here</a>'

S'My research and teaching interests focus on the emerging study of the archaeology of the Muslim World. This work was first developed while a graduate student in Anthropology at the <a href="http://anthropology.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a> and has continued as a member of the <a href="http://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/">Joukowsky Institute</a> faculty. More specifically my work has concentrated on understanding how Muslim societies have been shaped by the landscapes which they have constructed and conceived and by their relationship to the material world.  A major aspect of my research has consisted of developing a methodology for bringing the archaeological and textual records into a productive dialogue about past societies. Additionally, my work has sought to understand the relationship of materiality to religious experience and the place of archaeology in the study of religion.'

S'One of my current research projects is the study of water waves with vorticity.  This is a free-boundary problem because the water surface is an unknown.  Vorticity indicates the presence of eddies in the water.  I study exact waves modeled by the Euler equations without assuming shallow water or small-amplitude approximations.  Recently I have proven the existence of many continua of large-amplitude water waves.  Some questions under current study include the location of stagnation points, stability properties of the waves, periodic and solitary waves, numerical computation of the waves, and the occurrence of overhanging waves.  <br /><br />Another focus of my research is the instabilities of plasmas for which collisions are rare.  Such plasmas occur in various astrophysics phenomena and in hot nuclear reactors.  Despite a huge amount of research over several decades, precise analyses of instabilities have been made only in very special situations.  The usual model is the coupled Vlasov and Maxwell equations.  There are many equilibria, including homogeneous ones, electric ones and magnetic ones.  I am developing new general criteria for their stability.  <br /><br />Some other specific areas of my research include the stability of equilibria in semiconductor models, waves in hyperelastic materials, the scattering of fourth-order waves, and the interactions of nonlinear and spatial effects in wave models.'

My research currently focuses on two primary periods of development: adolescence and infancy. In adolescence, I am interested in normative shifts in the stress response over puberty and the stress response as a mechanism underlying the emergence of sex differences in depression. I also conduct studies examining the influence of maternal smoking on stress repsonses in adolescents. In infancy, I am interested in the influence of maternal smoking and depression during pregnancy on infant neurobehavior and stress response.

S'My research focuses on neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral stress response (dys)regulation over development and as a mechanism underlying the intergenerational transmission of affective and addictive disorders. My work focuses on risk for two key disorders:  a) depression and b) smoking/nicotine dependence and two critical periods of development: a) transition from middle childhood to adolescence, and b) transition from the fetal to the neonatal periods. Within adolescence, I am investigating dysregulation of the stress response as a mechanism underlying the emergence of gender differences in depression over adolescence. In particular, I have a strong interest in biological sensitivity to social rejection as a vulnerability marker for depression. Within the fetal/neonatal period, I am examining effects of maternal smoking and depression during pregnancy on fetal and infant neurobehavior and stress response. I have also begun to investigate biological pathways linking maternal smoking/depression with offspring neurobehavior, with a focus on placental neuroendocrine regulation.'

S'ON ADVICE OF COUNSEL: LAW, FINANCE AND THE EVOLUTION OF SILICON VALLEY<br /><br />This book project investigates the role of law firms and venture capital funds in fostering high-technology entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley.  Focusing on the Valley\'s formative years, the study examines (a) how entrepreneurs, lawyers, and venture capitalists worked together to formulate novel solutions to recurring business problems, and (b) how these interactions shaped the region\'s distinctive business style and identity.<br /><br />Organizational theorists argue that the birth of an industry represents a period of both opportunity and uncertainty.  New technologies create new niches, but technical knowledge rarely offers much guidance on how to structure businesses to fill those niches.  Frequently, the success of an infant industry depends on how quickly participants sense that they are engaged in a common enterprise.  Once businesses become aware of their similarities, they can begin to learn from one another\'s experiences, and to develop recognized models for exploiting the new industry\'s potential.  As such understandings spread, the industry comes to look less like a random collection of unrelated organizations and more like a true community.<br /><br />The study\'s findings will provide useful insights both for businesses struggling to survive the turbulence of new industries and also for policy-makers seeking to mold this turbulence into viable and innovative economic communities.<br /><br /><br />******************************************************************************************<br /><br />THE ORGANIZATIONAL, PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL CHALLENGES<br />OF NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN HEALTHCARE<br /><br />This study explores the organizational, professional and legal challenges posed by clinical information technology (CIT) in American healthcare.  Of particular interest are the new federal privacy, security and data-standardization regulations adopted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) -- as well as the policies and practices that healthcare organizations have implemented to become "HIPAA-compliant."  <br /><br />Although CITs such as electronic medical records and computerized practitioner order-entry promise to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care, they also raise the specter of new forms of competition, regulation, surveillance, and inequality.  The present study focuses on the "governance mechanisms" -- laws, rules, ethics and norms -- that are emerging to manage this CIT revolution.  The project promises important insights into how issues of privacy, security and data-standardization intersect with one another, as legal enactments, organizational cultures, and professional ethics combine to determine the fate of CIT initiatives both within particular organizations and throughout the healthcare sector as a whole.<br /><br />The study\'s findings will help policymakers to develop the immense potential of CIT while avoiding the equally immense pitfalls.  At the same time, the research will also help social scientists to understand the basic forces that shape innovation, standardization, trust, accountability, and legal compliance in the healthcare arena.'

S'Synthesis and Self-Assembly<br /><br />We utilize the so called "bottom-up" approach to synthesize monodisperse nanoparticles with various functionalities. The size, composition, and shape of these nanoparticles are tuned by controlling reaction conditions. Through proper surface modification, these nanoparticles are made dispersible in various media and self-assemble into superlattice structures. The effects of particle size, shape, composition, and interparticle spacing on physical and chemical properties of the nanostructures constitute issues of the critical importance and are addressed by our research.  <br /><br />Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications <br /><br />Recent advances in the synthetic control of nanoparticle monodispersity suggest that nanoparticle-based bio-probes should yield ultra-high sensitivity and efficacy.

S'Professor Suuberg\'s research interests revolve around the chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, particularly in relation to the fields of energy and environmental technology. At the present time, his group is exploring the thermodynamics of mixtures of high molecular weight organic compounds (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH, and other polycyclic aromatic compounds, PAC). Few data exist on vapor pressures of these materials, which constitute an important class of compounds of environmental concern. In addition to addressing the need for more data on this topic, the Suuberg group is looking at what sorts of mixing models will adequately describe the thermodynamics of mixtures of these compounds. Because many of these compounds are present as contaminants on Superfund sites or brownfields, the work extends to examination of how these materials interact with soils and water, including any adsorption interactions. This group is also using their understanding of soil contamination to develop new ways of characterizing the vapor intrusion problem. The latter problem of infiltration of contaminant vapors into structures is of greatly increasing national concern when it comes to reuse of contaminated lands. <br />In addition to the latter area, the Suuberg group has been involved in applications including combustion of coal, production of  alternative (green) fuels, fire safety and pollution prevention. Recently the work led to examination of novel sources of carbon materials (coal fly ash, automobile tires) for environmental applications, with implications for resource recycling. Gas-solid reactions of combustion and gasification interest are another major focus of Professor Suuberg\'s research interests. The kinetics of the annealing process in carbons, characterized by their loss of gasification reactivity, is related to the distributed activation energy kinetics of pyrolysis. The origin of the fractional order in such gas-solid reactions, the nature of active site distributions and their implications for kinetic modeling of the reaction processes are all questions of current interest in the field. Also, the development of porosity in ""activation"" of carbon is of interest. This work looks at the combustion reaction itself, as well as the environmentally important NO reduction process.'

S'My primary research interest is the function and evolution of the vertebrate skeletal system. I seek to better understand and interpret the tremendous diversity and range of adaptation in design of vertebrate, particularly mammalian skeletons. Comparative biologists have observed for centuries that skeletal morphology shows patterns of diversity among taxa that correspond to patterns of functional capability. My research program applies rigorous analysis of these complex structure/function interrelationships to improve our understanding of the adaptation of form and function to the mechanical environment. At the same time, I seek to understand the historical and physical limits of adaptation. Placed in a phylogenetic context, these results will ultimately help elucidate the nature of evolutionary changes in structural design and the behaviors facilitated and constrained by particular morphologies.<br /><br />My specific research objectives are: <br /><ul><li>To document directly the loads experienced by the mammalian skeleton during natural behaviors;</li><br /><li>To describe the morphology and mechanical properties of the skeleton in a functionally meaningful manner at a variety of organizational levels;</li><br /><li>To relate a detailed picture of mechanical usage to patterns of structural variation.</li></ul><br />Meeting these objectives will produce a more complete picture of the functional biology of the skeleton, and will ultimately generate new views of skeletal evolution through the analysis of historical patterns of change in skeletal architecture or functional performance in relation to phylogenetic diversification. <br />At present, my efforts to achieve these broad goals are concentrated along two primary lines of inquiry:<br /><ul><li>How do the wings of bats function in relation to their morphological organization?</li><br /><li>What is the significance of trabecular bone tissue? How does its architecture reflect its mechanical function?</li></ul>'

In 1987, she joined the faculty of Northwestern University in the interdisciplinary Primate Biology Graduate Program.  Around this time, she turned her attention from primate locomotion to bat flight, while maintaining active interests in fundamental aspects of size and scale in the architecture of bones.  Her work on bats flight includes studies of mechanical properties of tissues of the bat wing, dynamics of wing movements during flight, fluid dynamics of highly flexible airfoils, and aerodynamics and energetics of bat flight, and her active collaborations link biology to engineering, computer science, and mathematics.'

S'Electrochemistry<br /><br />We utilize electrochemical techniques to study the role of electron-transfer on the structure and reactivity of organometallic complexes containing pi-bonded hydrocarbon ligands.  In addition to a host of applications in synthesis and catalysis, such work provides insights into the fundamental chemical and physical processes occurring when an electron is transferred to or from a conducting surface.  A recent 2005 study demonstrated that naphthalene molecules drastically change their mode of bonding to a metal upon electron-transfer, and that this process is a prelude to the formation of catalytically active species.<br /><br />Self-Assembly<br /><br />It has been discovered that organometallic complexes containing quinonoid ligands undergo reversible electron- and proton-transfer reactions to generate species that self-assemble with metal ions into supramolecular metal-organometallic coordination networks (MOMNs).  The resulting materials are formed in a modular manner with a resulting dimensionality and architecture can be rationally controlled for applications in guest-host chemistry, sensing, and catalysis.  Recent work (2004) suggests that our new polymers may have several particularly important applications:  (1) coordination-driven self-assembly of metallic nanoparticles into superlattices (being investigated with Professor Shouheng Sun), (2) remediation of environmental problems based on PCB contamination, and (3) fossil fuel desulfurization.  <br /><br />Catalysis<br /><br />Organomometallic rhodium quinonoid complexes have been found (2005) to function as unprecedented multifunctional catalysts for enormously important carbon-carbon coupling reactions.  Joint work with Professor William Trenkle of Brown University and Professor Seung Uk Son of Sungkyunkwan University suggests that these reactions constitute an conceptual advance in the field of organometallic catalysis.  In a related manner, the rhodium quinones have been found (2005) to join with lithium compounds to generate a new class of promising organolithium reagents for use in synthesis.  Additionally, through charge-assisted hydrogen bonding the rhodium quinones form porous solid state materials with channels suitable for hydrogen storage (2006).'

S'My research focuses on the intersection between political economy, culture, and medicine. My field research began in the United States in health clinics providing for minorities and refugees. There I learned of the problems and concerns of refugee women whose reproductive rights were changing as the results of migration and social change. Further research was conducted with highlanders in the north of Thailand, the Hmong.  Reproduction, gender, cosmology and health-seeking behaviour were my main interests, and this led to investigating inequality for highlanders in the majority Thai society and in the patrilineal Hmong system.  Further research was conducted in Thailand on Hmong views of migration from rural to urban centers because of Thai efforts to incorporate minorities into the majority system. I was interested how these changes were affecting Hmong cultural dynamics. Further research was conducted on Hmong sexuality and how they and other highlanders could be encouraged to practice prevention in light of the high prevalence of  HIV/AIDS in the country.<br /><br />My new project on Hmong will take place in the U.S., where some 200,000 Hmong now live.

S'Professor Chung-I Tan\'s research has focused on non-perturbative consequences of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It has been a long held belief that QCD in a non-perturbative setting can be described by a string theory. The discovery by Maldacena of exact String/Gauge duality through the AdS/CFT mechanism now allows explicit calculation in some QCD like SUSY theories. The challenge is to abstract from these models fundamental concepts applicable to QCD. Prof. Tan has had a long interest in the formulation of the QCD string and in its phenomenological consequence. Specific efforts include the following areas: QCD from gauge/gravity duality, QCD at High Energy, Diffractive Scattering, Chirally improved lattice QCD, Confinement/de-confinement transitions, etc.  What follows is a brief description of some of his research results during the past three years, with key references listed as footnotes. Some of these results have also been reported in various topical conferences and workshops. <br /><br />These efforts have involved many active collaborators: Prof. R. Brower (Boston U.), Prof. E. M. Levin (Tel Aviv U.), Prof. S. Mathur (Ohio State U.), Prof. J. Polchinski, (UC, Santa Barbara), Prof. M. Strassler (U. of Washington), and Prof. C. Thorn (U. of Florida). Other collaborations include E.Berger (Argonne National Lab.), Koji Hashimoto (Tokyo), B. Mueller (Duke), S. Terashima (Kyoto), and others.<br /><br />QCD at High Energy and String/Gauge Duality: Prof. Tan with R. Brower, M. Strassler and J. Polchinski are now working on a range of problems investigating high-energy processes. In the absence of a complete formulation of a QCD string, the goal is to determine model independent consequence of String/Gauge duality for QCD. This general approach originates with the observation of Polchinski and Strassler  that the wide-angle scattering of glueballs in a cut-off AdS5 background gave power behavior consistent with parton counting rules.  This was extended to MQCD by Brower and Tan, where they noted also the subtlety of the Regge limit, and identified both the soft Pomeron trejectory for the tensor glueball and a hard component. This program initiated by Brower, Polchinski, Strassler and Tan holds the promise of a new era where string/gauge duality can be used directly to provide insights on experimental observables at high energies. <br /><br />Glueball and Stretched String Spectra: It is possible to test the viability of a dual QCD model by studying its spectral properties in comparison with lattice data.  In the strong coupling limit (where the dual is super gravity in AdS-like background), Brower, Mathur and Tan have performed the first complete calculation of the low-lying glueball spectrum. The construction is based on Witten\'s suggestion to introduce into the AdS7xS4 background a Euclidean black hole breaking conformal and super symmetries leading to a confining theory with a QCD like spectrum. In spite of obvious limitation, the comparison with lattice data of Morningstar and Peardon is encouraging. The full bosonic multiplet for the IIA supergraviton is required to match the spectra. <br /><br />Phenomenology of High Energy Diffractive Scattering: The field of "Pomeron" physics has been stimulated in recent years by the experimental studies for small-x physics at HERA as well as by "hard diffractive" measurements at FNAL; its import will become more prominent as one moves into the LHC energies, e.g., diffractive Higgs production.  Prof. Tan has carried out several related projects in this area. Prof. Tan has examined carefully the notion of Pomeron flux and its renormalization. By maintaining factorization, unambiguous predictions for double Pomeron exchange, doubly diffraction dissociation, etc., both at Tevatron and at LHC energies, can be made. In view of our recent work, (hep-th/0603115), further refinement is currently being formulated. Another project involves an effort in providing a unified treatment of HE hadronic collision incorporating both hard and soft processes at high energy. <br /><br />String/Flux-Tube Duality on the Lightcone: In collaboration with R. Brower and C. Thorn, Prof. Tan has also explored the equivalence of quantum field theory and string theory as exemplified by the AdS/CFT correspondence from the point of view of lightcone quantization. Brower, Tan, and Thorn have carried out an investigation to see how the lightcone description deals with the many aspects of the duality already understood from other starting points, e.g., on the string side, they discuss the lightcone version of small oscillations about the static string connecting a heavy external quark source to a heavy external antiquark source.  Their results are completely consistent with those obtained by more standard covariant methods , thus providing further support for the AdS/CFT conjecture.<br /><br />Glueballs in an AdS Black Hole and Localized Gravity: As a further exploration of the AdS/CFT correspondence, Brower, Mathur and Tan considered a model of brane world gravity in the context of non-conformal non-SUSY matter in the confined phase.  They modify the earlier strong coupling solution to the glueball spectrum in an AdS Black Hole by introducing a Randall-Sundrum Planck brane as a UV cut-off. The goal of this toy model is to exhibit a self-consistent model of gravity interacting with non-conformal matter in the confined phase. This gives rise to a compactified 5-d brane world gravity with a Kaluza-Klein ``photon\'\' and ``dilaton\'\'. In their earlier paper they had noted that the strong coupling glueball spectrum had an ``accidental\'\' scalar-tensor degeneracy.  The same mechanism that is need to split this spectral line consistent with QCD at weak coupling here is apparently needed to lift the dilaton mass consistent with cosmological constraints.'

S'Professor Tang is involved in a new research program of molecular biophysics.  The main goal of his research effort is to understand the mechanisms and properties of protein assemblies.  In particular, the Tang lab studies the assembly of the so-called cytoskeletal proteins, such as proteins called actin and tubulin, which form functional filaments in cells. <br /><br />Filamentous assemblies of proteins and nucleotides form a class of biomaterials with physical properties distinct from those of most synthetic polymers. Among these biomaterials are cytoskeletal filaments including filamentous actin (F-actin), microtubules, and intermediate filaments; collagen fibers in the extra-cellular matrix; duplex DNA in both extended and condensed forms; and filamentous viruses such as the bacteriophages fd, M13, and pf1. Various states of assembly occur in solutions of this class of biopolymers, including isotropic networks, liquid crystalline phases, and densely packed lateral aggregates often described as paracrystalline bundles. Elucidating the molecular interactions that govern the formation of all these states will provide a means to predict and manipulate transitions among them, and will therefore have potential applications for material science and biomedical engineering. <br /><br />The long-term goal of this line of research is to explore special features of these polymer systems in connection with phase transitions, and to identify and assess the inter-molecular forces that govern various states of assembly in aqueous solutions. We also explore strategies for potential treatment of certain human diseases based on the properties of large protein assemblies.<br /><br />Additionally, the Tang laboratory has recently undertaken biophysical studies of bacterial adhesion and motility, using the aquatic bacterial species <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. The study has revealed extraordinary strength of adhesion, which has implications for potentially developing a new class of adhesives.  An ongoing study of the <i>Caulobacter</i> swarmer cells suggests much higher swiming efficiency than <i>E. coli</i> and <i>V. alginolyticus</i>, showing an interersting example of adaptation of microorganisms through the course of evolution.'

S'Research in the Tatar laboratory aims to understand the mechanisms that regulate aging and how this life history trait evolves. With Drosophila as a model system, we integrate many experimental approaches to explore aging from the levels of population demography and individual physiology, and down to genetics and molecular biology. Our primary focus is to understand how life span is modulated by hormones, especially from systemic and intra-cellular signals of insulin-like peptides, and from the systemic action of juvenile hormone. In the context of insulin signaling, we manipulate genes within the pathway, such as the insulin-like receptor or the insulin responsive transcription factor dfoxo, to understand their functions within cells and between tissues. On the other hand, to this day, the way juvenile hormone transduces signals remains a mystery. Therefore, to learn how this key insect hormone modulates aging, we are using new cell-culture based approaches and RNAi technology to first understand its molecular mode of action. These analyses will together elucidate how the integrated organism regulates the factors that determine its pattern of senescence &#150; its exposure to somatic damage and its processes of somatic repair. Hormones are particularly interesting in this context because they integrate life span with reproduction, growth, and nutrient intake. Since many traits are mutually constraining, understanding hormone action in life history analysis will permit us to not only describe how organisms senescence, but also why.'

S'I study life history evolution with an emphasis on senescence. Senescence intrigues because it seems counter-intuitive to the process of natural selection. How can physiological and demographic functions deteriorate with age in the face of selection that relentlessly increases mean fitness? And, how has evolution led to the tremendous variation in life span we observe among individuals, species and taxa? The solutions to these questions lie in understanding the way selection acts on age-structured populations, and in discovering how gene expression affects fitness. My research uses multiple approaches to develop a basic understanding of the genetics, mechanisms and evolution of senescence.'

S'My research interests include political culture, transnational activism (including government-to-government programs), and military culture and institutional history. My ethnographic research to date has focused on political culture and human rights activism in Colombia, the United Nations and the United States. In my book, <i>Counting the Dead: Human Rights Claims and Counter-claims in Colombia</i>, forthcoming from the University of California Public Anthropology Series, I argue that the power of human rights to mobilize political action is derived not from claims of universality but from how human rights claims resonate with and rework existing political identities and agendas. I conducted fieldwork with non-governmental human rights organizations and civilian and military governmental human rights offices in Colombia and during the United Nations Human Rights Commission meetings in Geneva, Switzerland.  My current research continues my interest in the connections between public political discourses, the construction and practice of citizenship during violent conflicts, and globalization through an ethnographic exploration of U.S.-sponsored foreign assistance programs in Putumayo, Colombia. I argue that utopian visions and emotional rewards play a profound role in the ways policymakers attempt to orchestrate and impose social transformation abroad through international assistance programs, as well as shaping their reception abroad. Putumayo was the locus of the "Push into Southern Colombia," the centerpiece of the US Support for Plan Colombia, a US$1.3 billion aid package designed by the Clinton Administration and expanded by President George Bush, involving military, humanitarian, and development programs. By examining multiple sites in the foreign aid process, including policy debates, the contractors and organizations charged with program implementation, and the recipient communities, this project offers unique insight into the entire cycle of international assistance, and the critical role of the global imaginaries of the officials that orchestrate such programs. Continuing my interest in political culture and human rights institutions, I have also begun an oral history project with members of the National Victims Movement in Colombia who have organized in response to the creation of a Commission for Reconciliation and Reparations as part of negotiations between the government and paramilitary groups.<br />My research and teaching interests have emerged from more than a decade of professional experience with non-profit human rights organizations based in Latin America and Washington, D.C.  I have conducted field research for a range of organizations, including the Washington Office on Latin America, Human Rights Watch, UNICEF, and the Center for Humanitarian Dialogue.  The results of this research have been published as institutional reports, policy briefs, and in the North America Congress on Latin America (NACLA) Report on the Americas, among others.  Through my work as a teacher and researcher, I am committed to the practice of public anthropology and furthering the ways in which ethnographic research can contribute to more thoughtful public discussions of issues including violence, foreign policy, and human rights.'

S'I joined the Division of Engineering at Brown University in the Fall of 2003 after thirteen years at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, where I was a Research Staff Member. During my first five years at IBM Research I belonged to the Exploratory Computer Vision group. During the next five years I managed the Visual and Geometric Computing group. During the 2000-2001 academic year I was on sabbatical at the California Institute of Technology as Visiting Professor of Electrical Engineering. The following year, back at IBM, I was a member of the Visual Technologies department. Finally, in the Fall of 2002 I joined the Pervasive Computing Solutions group as a project leader, where I lead a team effort to design and build miniature smart cameras for real-time audio/visual signal processing applications.<br /><br />I earned a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Brown University, and a Licenciado en Ciencias Matem&#225;ticas degree from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was named IEEE Fellow for my contributions to the development of three-dimensional geometry compression technology and multimedia standards.<br /><br />My main research interests fall into the following disciplines: Applied Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics, Geometric Modeling, 3D Photography, and Computer Vision. For the last few years my main line of research has been related to the development of efficient, simple, and mathematically sound algorithms to operate on 3D objects represented as polygonal meshes, with an emphasis on technologies to enable the use of 3D models for Web-based applications. I made significant theoretical and practical contributions in several areas, such as: 3D capturing and surface reconstruction, modeling, compression, progressive transmission, signal processing, and display of polygonal meshes. The 3D geometry compression technology that I developed with my group at IBM is now part of the MPEG-4 standard, and integral part of IBM products.<br /><br />At Brown I plan to continue with this line of work, expand the work that I initiated at IBM on smart cameras, and start new initiatives in embedded systems design, very large smart camera networks, real-time distributed audio/visual signal processing algorithms, and applications.'

S'My research on early modern Jewish history is best characterized as integrative and comparative.  It is my understanding that, even in the early modern period, Jewish society did not exist separately from the society which surrounded it, but rather formed an integral part of it.  Thus, in order to understand the history of Polish-Lithuanian Jewry, it is crucial first to grasp the complex, multi-cultural nature of the Polish-Lithuanian state.  Consequently each phenomenon of this aspect of Jewish history must be researched within the context of the broader social and cultural system of which it formed a part, and compared with parallel phenomena in non-Jewish history.<br /><br />I developed this approach first in my monograph on living conditions in the Jewish quarter of Poznan in the seventeenth century.  In this study I analyzed the history of the Jews in one of the largest Jewish quarters in Europe by showing, among other things, the ways in which the experience of Jews and non-Jews who lived together, sharing the same urban infrastructure (such as streets, water supply, sewage and trash-removal), were parallel yet different.  In my second book &#150; a study of the economic role and social status of the Jews on the estates belonging the powerful Radziwill family in Lithuania in the eighteenth century &#150; I further developed this approach.  By examining the Radziwill estates as a specific form of economic enterprise, the crucial role that the Jews played in the economy came into sharp focus, allowing me to explain the causes for its development as well as its implications for both Polish Jewish society and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a whole.<br /><br />My next study focused on the rabbinate, long viewed as a wholly "internal" Jewish institution.  However, by examining it not only with the sources of Jewish provenance, but also through the prism of documentation produced by the various authorities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, I revealed that the rabbinate not only played an important role in the general administrative system as one of the means of controlling Jewish society, but also modeled itself on the institutions of Polish society from which it derived its power.  In turn, this revealed changes in the way Polish-Lithuanian Jews related to the religious heritage which their rabbis transmitted to them.<br /><br />As I have been working on this project, a different aspect of the stormy history of mid-seventeenth century Polish-Lithuanan Jewry has begun to interest me further.  Having concentrated my research on the Polish context of Polish-Lithuanian Jewish history, it has become clear to me that we now need to reassess the Jewish context of that history.  I am therefore now working on a study which will deal with the seventeenth century Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugee crisis which followed the Chmielnicki uprising of 1648 and subsequent wars.  In it, I examine both the experiences of the refugees themselves and the ways in which various communities and institutions in different countries co-operated in order to help them.  Through this work, I hope to be able to reconstruct the social, economic, and personal connections which created the seventeenth century Jewish world, stretching from England to Iran and from Riga to Cairo.  I should thus be able to assess both Polish-Lithuanian Jewry\'s changing place within a wider Jewish world, and the ways in which the wider Jewish world influenced the development of Polish-Lithuanian Jewry in the early modern period.'

S'Over the last decade, we have witnessed great advances in high-throughput assays of mRNA and protein abundance. However, these advances have been so rapid that they have overwhelmed our abilities to analyze the resulting data. While the response to this data analysis challenge from the computational sciences community has been impressive and resulted in greatly improved data analysis technologies, much remains to be done.  <br /><br />Perhaps the most pressing needs for improvement lies at the intersection of statistics and biology. The long-term goal of my work is to build biological mechanisms into the data analytic models.  In so doing, the resulting inferences can be focused on the production of testable hypotheses concerning the underlying biological mechanism.<br /><br />Much of my work in this direction has focused on the use of Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Gibbs sampling for the detection of regulatory elements in DNA sequence data. To this end, I have been a principal developer of the Gibbs Motif Sampler (<a href="http://bayesweb.wadsworth.org/gibbs/gibbs.html">Gibbs Motif Sampler</a>), one of the most popular computational tools for predicting regulator sites. <br /><br />My current research interests include improvement of MCMC techniques for regulatory signal detection by the incorporation of genome scale data that identify the approximate coordinates of specific functional sites: for example, the locations of protein binding sites based on immunoprecipitation ChIP-chip and ChIP-PET experiments and the exploration of improved computational techniques for inference in high-dimensional domains such as sequence alignment.'

Finding the signals that control this expression and understanding their interactions is a key to learning the language of the genes.

S'My current work includes the following projects and research interests:<br /><br />1. A hypertext-multimedia DVD on the life and preaching of the Rev. C. L. Franklin (father of Aretha), of Detroit, MI. I spent 1977-78 in Detroit supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Fellowship for Independent Study and Research on Rev. Franklin\'s life and preaching. Franklin was the most popular African American Baptist preacher of his generation, and his sermons served as models for many listeners. Like a rock star, he made record albums of his sermons (more than 70), recorded live at his home church of New Bethel, in Detroit. With gospel groups such as The Ward Singers accompanying him, he went on preaching tours to black communities all over the U.S. from the early 1950s through the early 1970s. In Detroit I was able to spend time with Rev. Franklin at his home, where I tape-recorded his life history in several sessions over many days. I was also able to make audio and video tape recordings of his sermons during this time. The videos are of special interest as they are the only films ever made of his preaching. These sessions will form the basis of the DVD, which is being produced at Brown University and will be published and distributed by the University of Illinois Press. The DVD will also contain complete texts of all Rev. Franklin\'s sermons, as well as audio excerpts from his life history, interpretative and contextual information, still photos, and excerpts from my book, <i>Give Me This Mountain</i> (on  Rev. Franklin\'s life and sermons) and from Nick Salvatore\'s biography of Franklin, <i>Singing in a Strange Land</i>. <br /><br />2. A hypertext-multimedia interactive fiction entitled <i>The Virtual Festival</i>. In this computer representation of a folk festival, the user experiences something of what it is like to be both front stage and backstage at a folk festival, viewing and listening to presentations, performances, and narratives, while also overhearing conversations backstage, many of which highlight the intentions of the festival organizers, the logistical and other problems they encounter, and the excitement generated when all come together to stage it. <i>The Virtual Festival</i> can be a teaching tool as well as an interactive fiction. In one projected version, it follows a conflict over authority that emerges between a performer and various festival organizers concerning the way the performer is represented, thus foregrounding certain problems and issues involved with festival presentation today. The internet is envisioned as the delivery system for this project, and I demonstrated an early version of it at the 2005 conference of the American Folklore Society.<br /><br />3. Ethnographic research on the musical culture and lined hymnody of Old Regular Baptists in southeastern Kentucky. This is an ongoing project which began in 1990 and has resulted in numerous field recordings and videos, as well as two CDs published by Smithsonian Folkways, demonstrations of lined hymnody at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 1997 (see my article, "\'The Real Thing,\'" for an interpretation of their appearance at that event), and at a conference on lined hymnody that took place in 2005 at Yale University. I envision a collaborative musical ethnography in the form of a book, with a CD insert, to emerge from this work.<br /><br />4. A project theorizing the concept of "sustainable music," which considers music as a human cultural resource. I organized a panel on the subject for the Fall 2006 conference of the Society for Ethnomusicology; papers from that panel were published in a special issue of <i> the world of music </i> in 2009. In the meantime I\'ve been developing an ecological approach to musical and cultural sustainability, contrasting the sustainability discourses of conservation ecology and developmental economics. Most recently I delivered a series of lectures on this subject at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China, and I am scheduled to deliver five invited lectures on it during the spring of 2011, at the University of Texas, the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina, Portland State University, and Indiana University. My current thinking in this area can be seen on my research blog: http://sustainablemusic.blogspot.com/<br /><br />5. Fiction writing and musical performance and composition. I continue to write and publish fiction, and to compose and perform music. Recently I read my fiction at the Hugh Ogden Memorial Reading, in Rangeley, Maine, in August of 2009; my most recent public appearance as a musician took place at the Common Ground Fair, in September 2010, in Unity, Maine, with the Bound to Have a Little Fun String Band.'

S'Jeff Todd Titon received the B.A. from Amherst College, and the M.A. (in English) and Ph.D. (in American Studies) from the University of Minnesota, where he studied ethnomusicology with Alan Kagan, writing his dissertation on blues music. He has done fieldwork on religious folk music, blues, and old-time fiddling, with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities. For two years he was the guitarist in the Lazy Bill Lucas Blues Band, a group that appeared in the 1970 Ann Arbor Blues Festival; in the 1980s he took up the fiddle and banjo, and most of his music-making today involves old-time string band music from the upper South. He also repairs and restores violins. He is the author or editor of seven books, including <i>Early Downhome Blues</i> (1977; 2nd edition, University of North Carolina Press, 1994), which won the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award; <i>Worlds of Music </i> (five editions since 1984, with translations into Italian and Chinese); <i>Powerhouse for God </i> (a book, record, and documentary film); and most recently <i>Old-Time Kentucky Fiddle Tunes</i> (University Press of Kentucky, 2001), and <i>American Musical Traditions,</i> (Gale, 2002), chosen by <i>Library Journal</i> as one of the outstanding reference works of 2003. His work in applied ethnomusicology was the subject of an interview by John Fenn in the fall, 2003 issue of <i>Folklore Forum</i>. In 1991 he pioneered in writing a hypertext-multimedia computer program on old-time Kentucky fiddler Clyde Davenport that is still regarded as a model for weblike interactive computer representations of people making music. His current projects include ongoing fieldwork with Old Regular Baptists in eastern Kentucky, with whom he has produced two CDs for Smithsonian Folkways (1997 and 2003); a DVD on the life and preaching of the Rev. C. L. Franklin, father of the singer Aretha Franklin, which will include video footage of his chanted sermons; writings on music and sustainability (see http://sustainablemusic.blogspot.com/) and fiction writing. From 1990 to 1995 he was editor of <i>Ethnomusicology,</i>, the Journal of the Society for Ethnomusicology. He is a Fellow of the American Folklore Society. His teaching began at Tufts University, where he was assistant professor of English, then associate professor of English and music. He has been a visiting professor at Carleton College, Amherst College, Berea College, the University of Maine, and Indiana University. Since 1986 he has been professor of music (ethnomusicology) at Brown.'

He is author of Liberalism Beyond Justice: Citizens Society and the Boundaries of Political Theory (Princeton University Press, 2001), and numerous articles.<br /><br />He received his B.A. from Colby College, his M.A. from the University of Arizona (1990), and his B.

His specializations are political theory and ethics and public policy.<br /><br />Liberal regimes shape the ethical outlook of their citizens, relentlessly influencing their most personal commitments over time. This fact raises pressing questions: If liberals cannot prevent the spillover of public values into nonpublic domains, how accommodating of diversity can a liberal regime actually be? To what degree can a liberal society be a home even to the people whose viewpoints it was formally designed to include?'

S'Hepatitis B virus (HBV): chronically infects nearly 400 million people worldwide, leading to viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. HBV is endemic in Asia, where the virus usually transmits from HBeAg+ mother to infants. HBV related liver cancer is a leading cause of death among males in this part of the world. Asian patients are infected primarily by genotypes B and C. Over the course of decades of infection, the wild-type virus is gradually replaced by various mutants, including precore mutants and core promoter mutants. HBV isolated from most liver cancer patients harbor core promoter mutations.<br /><br />Experimental approaches: cloning of full-length HBV genomes from patient sera or making chimeric constructs or site-directed mutants; generation of replication competent form (dimer); transfection into human hepatoma cells; analysis of protein expression, genome replication, and virion secretion. <br /><br />Research projects:<br /><br />1.&#9;Regulation of HBeAg expression by naturally occurring mutations. Known and potential mutations include those affecting transcription of HBeAg mRNA, translation initiation, premature chain termination, posttranslational cleavage (signal peptide removal and carboxyl terminus removal), maintenance of HBe antigenicity by a disulfide bond. Current interest is to identify the enzyme responsible for carboxyl terminal cleavage.<br /><br />2.&#9;Regulation of genome replication. We are interested in determining whether the common precore mutation that abolishes HBeAg expression enhances genome replication. We would like to establish the molecular mechanisms whereby core promoter mutations enhance genome replication. We hypothesize that enhanced genome replication brought about by the core promoter and/or precore mutations elevate the risk of developing liver cancer.<br /><br />3.&#9;Regulation of virion secretion. We have identified amino acid substitutions in the core protein and envelope proteins that impair virion secretion. We have also identified an amino acid substitution in the envelope proteins that can overcome the secretion defect induced by other mutations in the same proteins. In addition, we found certain point mutations in the core protein can affect the genome maturity of secreted virions. Future studies aim to elucidate the mechanisms involved.<br /><br />4.&#9;Characterization of virion secretion property of the immune escape mutants. Current HBV vaccine is made of the major envelope protein and induces neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine fails in some people due to the emergence of the so-called "immune escape mutants" containing amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes. We hypothesize that immune escape mutants will not overtake the wild-type virus because they are compromised in virion secretion. Experiments are being conducted to test this hypothesis.'

S'At critical points in chronic liver injury the potential for liver repair is lost. Timely surgical and medical treatment, however, initiates liver repair in infants, children, and adults, interrupting the cycle of inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. The subsequent cellular regulation of matrix protein degradation and resolution of injury-dependent fibrosis is unknown. The long-term goals of our studies are to define the molecular mechanisms required for ordered matrix resorption and liver repair without scar. Specific aims have been designed to test the hypothesis that repair, resolution of scar, and the restoration of hepatic architecture depend on coordinated regulatory mechanisms of matrix degradation through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) gene expression, cellular localization, and most importantly, biologic activity. Further, we propose that Kupffer cells (KC), the resident macrophage population, have a central role in the inflammatory and fibrogenic regulation of liver repair after chronic injury. Specific Aim 1 addresses the molecular and cellular mechanisms of reversible hepatic fibrosis and those of delayed matrix resorption. A unique rat model of reversible biliary obstruction will simulate early, intermediate, and late, near end stage cholestatic liver injury. This model allows biliary decompression to initiate liver repair. The effect of injury duration on matrix (Collagen I, III, IV, elastin, laminin), MMP (1,2,8,9,13,14), and TIMP (1,2) mRNA and protein expression will be measured in whole liver and cells using new methods of laser capture microdissection. Changes in these profiles will be directly applied to the mechanism of matrix resorption by simultaneous measurement of MMP activity by in-gel and in situ zymography. Specific Aim 2 mechanistically tests the hypothesis that KC are in vivo regulators of matrix metabolism. Through strategies of KC depletion/inactivation by gadolinium or Dexa-Man10-HSA targeted dexamethasone during repair, matrix resorption, regulatory cytokine profiles, and MMP-TIMP activity will be localized in cells and measured. In Specific Aim 3 we will establish the effect of progressive injury on the in vitro capacity of isolated hepatic macrophages (Mf) to express specific MMP and fibrogenic/antifibrogenic cytokine (TGFb, IL1, 6, 10) profiles during repair. KC inactivation and MMP stimulation/suppression strategies will isolate the net collagenolytic activity of Mf. Apart from broad clinical implications for the treatment of cholestatic or other chronic liver diseases, these studies have the potentialto be the first studies to identify key molecular mechanisms for successful repair after progressive liver injury. They have the potential to yield targets for therapy to promote liver repair or rescue patients approaching end stage liver disease.'

S'When I joined the Department of Modern Culture and Media at Brown, in September 2005, the United States was embroiled in a controversial war in Iraq, but there was little evidence of protest on the campus. For most of the previous decade, I had worked at the intersection of contemporary art and new media. I had founded and run Rhizome, an organization dedicated to the exchange of ideas and information in the field of new media art, and had made several Internet art projects. But as I was finishing New Media Art (Taschen, 2006), a book I co-wrote with the journalist Reena Jana, and as the death toll in Iraq continued to mount, I became increasingly interested in the place of protest in contemporary politics, and in the ways in which protest is performed, documented and mediated.<br /><br />Since arriving at Brown, I have investigated these themes in two major works (the Port Huron Project and The Dystopia Files) and several smaller ones (Star Spangled Cover, Chinoise A, Sweet Child Solos, and The New Revolution).<br /><br />These projects are animated by three interrelated questions:<br /><br />&#149;&#9;How has the use of media to document and represent political protest changed the ways in which protest is performed?<br /><br />&#149;&#9;How have contemporary technologies of mediation and distribution shaped the role of protest in the public sphere?<br /><br />&#149;&#9;How can the formal language of video installation be used to investigate the ways in which performance is conventionally documented and represented?<br /><br /><b>The Port Huron Project (2006-2009)</b><br /><br />In September 2006, I staged the first of six reenactments of protest speeches from the Vietnam era: a public address originally delivered by Coretta Scott King in 1968 in New York City\'s Central Park. By reenacting and re-documenting events from the radical movements of the 1960s and \'70s, I sought to investigate the ways in which these movements are remembered, imagined, and invoked in the context of contemporary political protest. The New Left casts a long shadow over today\'s radical activists, and I felt I had to address its legacy if I was to begin to understand the mood of political despair and futility I sensed around me.<br /><br />The following summer, I staged reenactments of speeches given by Paul Potter, president of Students for a Democratic Society, at the 1965 March on Washington and by Howard Zinn at a 1971 peace rally on Boston Common. In 2008, I staged reenactments of speeches given by Angela Davis at a 1969 Black Panther rally in Oakland, Cesar Chavez at a 1971 Vietnam veterans memorial rally in Los Angeles, and Stokely Carmichael at a 1968 peace march in New York City. <br /><br />Two of the speeches had been published in books; the others I transcribed from audio recordings or found in archives. I selected speeches that were both rhetorically effective and apposite to contemporary politics. For example, Paul Potter\'s speech included these lines: "WHAT IN FACT has the war done for freedom in America? It has led to even more vigorous governmental efforts to control information, manipulate the press, and pressure and persuade the public through distorted or downright dishonest documents." <br />I cast actors to deliver the speeches in the parks and streets where they were first given. Audiences, which included invited guests and passersby, ranged in size from 25 to 300 people. I avoided period costumes, props, and other common features of historical reenactments. My goal was not to take my audience on a nostalgic journey into the past, but, rather, to bring these strikingly relevant speeches into the present as a way of denaturalizing contemporary politics&#151;to create moments during which one might ask why, despite the parallels between the Vietnam era and this one, the "massive social movement" envisioned by Potter in his 1965 address seems almost inconceivable today. "Most of the college-age spectators gathered there in a clutch were fully aware that they were witnessing art, but by the end they also seemed not to be simply playing along but to be engaged by Mr. Potter\'s arguments," wrote one reporter who attended my reenactment of Potter\'s speech. (Kennedy, Randy. "Giving New Life to Protests of Yore." New York Times 28 July 2007: B1.) At the same time, by setting up situations in which the past seemed to speak to the present, I sought to provoke a critical interrogation of common notions and uses of history. As Rebecca Schneider, Chair of the Department of Theatre and Performance Studies at Brown, wrote about the Port Huron Project:<br /><br /><i>Questions of the returns of history that arise around such reenactments can be mind-boggling: What happens to linear history if nothing is ever fully completed nor discreetly begun? &#133; [T]he artist makes work that touches another temporal register, bringing an alternative now into play and using seeming anachronism, suggestive deferral, and explicit repetition as political and aesthetic spurs to thought&#133;. Tribe and many other artists currently engaging reenactment complicate the singularity of "now" and approach performance by mixing and matching time, playing across temporal registers through explicit and literal re-play. The queering of time troubles our heritage of Enlightenment (and capitalist "development") investments in straightforward linearity as the only way to mark time, reminds us of a durational "now" for political action, and points to a politic in veering, revolving, turning around, and reappearing. </i> (Performing Remains: Art and War in Times of Theatrical Reenactment. New York: Routledge, 2011. 180-182.)<br /><br />I worked with college students, high school students, and young artists to produce extensive documentation of each reenactment. The photographers, videographers, sound recordists, and other production crew played a significant role in the events themselves: they became part of the spectacle, serving as inescapable reminders of the artifice inherent in reenactment, as well as the importance of cameras as vicarious spectators for whom protesters perform.<br /><br />From this documentation, I made single-channel videos that could be viewed on YouTube, downloaded under Creative Commons licenses, exhibited in galleries, or screened in cinemas and other venues. The videos cut between four cameras, but included no voiceovers, archival footage, interviews, or other means of contextualizing the reenactments. I wanted these works to function as documentation rather than as documentary&#151;as ambiguous actualities that raise questions while providing few answers. The videos have been exhibited as looping single-screen projections at several venues, including the National Center for Contemporary Art, Moscow, and Trinity Square Video, a media art space in Toronto. They also received cinematic screenings at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Dance Theater Workshop in New York City, and the Cranbrook Art Museum in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.<br /><br />For a 2008 exhibition on a giant high-definition video screen in Times Square, I made short videos of the reenactments featuring close-ups of the speakers and cable news-style graphics. This format was dictated in part by practical considerations: the crawl, closed captions, and other on-screen text compensated for the venue\'s lack of sound and curatorial context. But, by presenting these speeches as if they were contemporary news, I also foregrounded the question of how radical politics are represented in mainstream media, and how these representations have changed since protesters appeared on the evening news programs of broadcast networks in the late 1960s and early \'70s. These videos were later exhibited as Port Huron Project: The Whole World Is Watching (Times Square Edition) at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, a New York City gallery, and at the Contemporary Museum in Baltimore.<br /><br />For "Democracy in America," a 2008 group exhibition organized by Creative Time at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City, I made a panoramic installation featuring two high-definition video projections. Each projector corresponded to a stationary camera at the performance, displaying a single unedited shot. By matching angles of projection to camera angles, and scaling the projections so that the figures on screen were more or less life-sized, I produced an effect of spatial correlation between the installation and the event site. The panoramic aspect ratio afforded by side-by-side, high-definition video projections created a quasi-immersive experience which, because of the sculptural presence of the screens and the gap between them, remained fractured and incomplete. The installation\'s symbolic form thus suggested a parallel between gallery visitors and reenactment participants, while at the same time reminding those in the gallery that, like the installation, the reenactments were mediated fabrications.<br /><br />As in conventional cinema, the screens functioned as virtual windows onto a coherent space. But by presenting two different camera angles simultaneously, arranging the screens in an asymmetrical V formation, using rear projections (so that visitors did not cast shadows), and eschewing cinematic techniques of camera movement and editing, I encouraged spectators to engage the video with a kind of bodily involvement different from that afforded by conventional cinema: to zoom in by approaching the screen, pan by turning their heads, etc. The net effect of these formal structures was to draw attention to the embodied performativity of the spectator and, by extension, to the significance of the body in protest, both as performing subject and, via the mediating apparatus of video, as spectacle. And bodily performance, I would argue, is crucial to understanding the roles played by protest and its mediated representations in the public sphere. Protest functions not only through words but also through deeds and images. The public sphere is not only a discursive realm of rational-critical debate, as formulated by J&#252;rgen Habermas and others, but also a space of embodied action&#151;a performative space in which human bodies play a decisive role. <br /><br />The final incarnation of the project was a book, The Port Huron Project: Reenactments of New Left Protest Speeches, published by Edizioni Charta (Milan) in 2010. It includes the full texts of the speeches, archival photos of the original speakers, photos of the reenactments and installations, and essays by Rebecca Schneider and Nato Thompson, Chief Curator at Creative Time. I conceived and edited the book, and wrote the introduction.<br />My work, like that of other contemporary artists whose audience straddles academia, the art world, and the broader public, has generated commentary in scholarly publications, specialized art magazines, and mainstream periodicals. The Port Huron Project was the focus of an article in Framework: the Journal of Cinema and Media, a peer-reviewed, international journal, and discussed extensively by Rebecca Schneider in Performing Remains. It was reviewed or featured in Artforum, Frieze, Flash Art, the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Los Angeles Times. It has been included in 20 exhibitions and screenings, and was supported by the Creative Capital Foundation ($50,000) and the New York Foundation for the Arts ($7,000).<br /><br /><b>The Dystopia Files (2010-2011)</b><br /><br />The 1999 protests surrounding the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Seattle, Washington, marked a turning point both for political protest and for the ways in which the state attempts to manage it. Protesters developed new models of organizing, such as affinity groups and spokescouncils, and new tactics of direct action. Governments, in turn, heightened security measures by denying protest permits, surveilling and infiltrating activist groups, preemptively detaining activists, creating militarized security zones, and deploying "less-lethal" weapons such as tasers, tear gas, and Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs). The policing of protest intensified again after 2001, as laws preventing domestic spying were repealed, anti-terrorism funding flowed to law-enforcement agencies, and larger patterns of militarization and control emerged. Activist groups responded to this new environment by adopting "security culture" practices intended to prevent infiltration and avoid surveillance.<br /><br />In 2009, I began work on The Dystopia Files, an archive of video clips depicting public interactions between police and protesters in the United States and Canada between 2000 and 2010. Typically shot on city streets during protest actions of various kinds, this footage portrays scenes of public conflict that are by turns familiar and shocking. I shot some of the material myself; the rest was recorded by activists, observers, police, journalists, and other artists.<br /><br />In the course of assembling this archive, I attended many protests and spoke with activists, civil-rights attorneys, scholars, and journalists. I also spent dozens of hours watching videos. I was fascinated by the storm-trooper gear, weaponry, and choreographed movements of the police, as well as the costumes, signage, chants, and gestures of the activists. The performance studies scholar Baz Kershaw has argued that protest became increasingly theatrical in the decades following 1968, due in part to the ways in which the media frame politics as performance ("Fighting in the Streets: Dramaturgies of Popular Protest, 1968-1989." New Theatre Quarterly 13 [1997]: 255-276). I realized that the footage I had been collecting reflected not only the spectacle of protest and discipline, but also the changing relationship between protest and mediation in an era of proliferating video cameras and social media. I came to see protest as a kind of public ritual, in which activists and police play socially defined roles and perform unscripted yet predictable actions for imagined audiences (from YouTube watchers to judges) represented by video cameras. <br /><br />I exhibited The Dystopia Files as an interactive installation at the 2010 DeCordova Biennial at the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln, Massachusetts. I projected clips from the archive onto a frosted glass door that led to a small gallery space. The space was rigged with a system of sensors and switches that controlled the projection and the gallery lights. When a visitor opened the gallery door (onto which the video was projected), the projection stopped and the gallery lights turned on. The gallery was empty except for a set of locked flat files, the drawers of which were labeled with the names of protest groups and political art collectives currently active in North America, ranging from the relatively familiar (Code Pink, The Yes Men) to the obscure (Shadowy Revolutionary Cell, Zombie Flash Mob). The projection remained off, and the lights remained on, as long as the room was occupied. <br />The installation functioned as an inverted camera obscura, selectively revealing and concealing the contents of the archive. The archival video could only be seen from outside the gallery, where, because of the vertical proportions of the door, large parts of the video frame were obscured. When a viewer attempted to enter the archive, the system of surveillance and control responded by extinguishing the spectacle of conflict. The installation\'s operations mirrored the interplay of exposure and occlusion that has characterized the visual representation of protest in recent years: each group plays its part, rendering itself visible before the eyes of ubiquitous video cameras. But, because the video captured by each party serves an evidentiary function in legal skirmishes and public relations campaigns, it is carefully guarded, and released only under specific conditions of display. The few clips that find their way into public view, such as the widely circulated video of protesters burning police cars at the 2010 G20 Summit in Toronto, tend to be presented with little context, as transparent signifiers that speak for themselves. My installation rehearsed this decontextualization by displaying what activists sometimes call "protest porn," without any background information, yet its interactivity suggested that state power functions as much through classification (e.g. the naming of suspects) as it does through denial of access (to images and information).<br /><br />In October and November 2010, I showed The Dystopia Files at the Cin&#233;ma des Cin&#233;astes in Paris, as part of a program organized in conjunction with the inaugural exhibition at Le Bal, a new venue for the "document-image." For these screenings, I made a 30-minute montage of clips from the archive, over which I superimposed vertical black bars of varying widths, which slowly traversed the screen. I invited Fr&#233;d&#233;ric D. Oberland, a Parisian guitarist, to play a guitar solo during the screening. Standing between the audience and the screen, Oberland improvised in response to the video. His presence emphasized both the performative qualities of the actions represented on the screen and the performative nature of spectatorship. In January 2011, I invited Marcy Mays, lead guitarist of Scrawl, to play during a screening of the same video at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.<br /><br />In June 2011, I exhibited The Dystopia Files as an interactive installation at the Galerija Miroslav Kraljevic (G-MK) in Zagreb, Croatia. In this iteration of the project, I projected video from the archive onto three walls of the gallery: one showed footage shot by police, another showed video shot by observers, and the third showed video shot by protesters. I positioned the projectors at odd angles so that the images they produced had irregular shapes (two trapezoids and a hexagon) instead of the standard rectangles.<br />These projections were visible from outside the gallery through an exterior wall of mirrored glass. But when the gallery door was opened, the  protest videos were replaced by monochromatic projections (green, blue, and red). The color fields remained visible as long as visitors were present in the gallery. When the gallery was unoccupied, or when visitors remained motionless for at least twenty seconds, the protest video returned. <br /><br />As in the DeCordova installation, access to the protest video was governed by a system that sensed the spectator\'s presence and determined the conditions under which the video was visible. But at G-MK, visitors entered the gallery to find not locked files but fields of projected color&#151;a formalist gesture suggesting, as Herbert Marcuse argued, that even the most political art risks aestheticizing that which it aims to critique.'

S'Our studies are focused on the signal transduction pathways important for regulation of cardiac myocyte proliferation during the transition from fetal to early postnatal life. The growth of cardiac myocytes switches from hyperplasia to hypertrophy shortly after birth. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the switch are not well understood. We have demonstrated that beta-adrenergic receptors (betaAR) are involved in regulation of neonatal cardiac myocyte proliferation, and that this mitogenic control is in large part mediated via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) pathway. We examined the expression and activity of PI3K signaling during development and shown that there is a globally high input of cardiac PI3K signaling activity during late gestation and in the early postnatal days of development, but not in postnatal and adult life. The high signaling activity occurs when cardiac myocytes are undergoing hyperplastic growth. In neonatal rats, when cardiac p70S6K activity is already maximal, there is no further activation by betaAR stimulation. In contrast, acute betaAR stimulation results in activation of p70S6K at later stages when the endogenous activity is low. Our findings suggest that betaAR activation, via the PI3K signaling pathway, plays a significant role in regulation of cardiac myocyte proliferation in a development-dependent manner. We hypothesize the PI3K signaling pathway is critical for regulation of cardiac myocyte proliferation during the transition from fetal to early postnatal life. Attenuation of the PI3K signaling pathway underlies terminal differentiation in postproliferative cardiac myocytes. We further hypothesize that activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in postproliferative cardiac myocytes will augment cardiac myocyte proliferation in response to ischemic injury.<br /><br />We have engineered a tetracycline transactivator-controlled conditional transgenic mouse line with cardiac-specific overexpression of PI3K. This new transgenic animal model allows us to induce or suppress cardiac PI3K at desirable time points during development and address the question whether temporal overexpression of PI3K signaling in the heart can stimulate cardiac myocyte proliferation in postproliferative stages without causing cardiac hypertrophy that is normally seen in constitutive overexpression animal models. Our recent data suggests that cardiac-specific conditional overexpression of PI3K in the postnatal animal improves myocardial function. There is emerging evidence for cardiac myocyte proliferation in the regions adjacent to myocardial infarction in human and in animal models. We are using the new animal model to address the role of PI3K signaling in cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction. These studies will contribute to our understanding of the regulation of cardiac proliferation during the perinatal transition and in pathological conditions during adult life.'

Currently we are focusing on the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor and PI3K signaling pathway on the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation during the transition from fetal to neonatal stages. Multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches are used in our study. A new animal model was established in our laboratory in which overexpression of cardiac-specific PI3K can be induced or repressed with a tetracycline transactivator-controlled binary system. This conditional transgenic animal model is been applied to investigate 1) the critical role of PI3K signaling in regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation; and 2) the effect of PI3K signaling in acute cardiac injury."

S'My research is centered on popular musicians, their fans and followers, and the people who structure the dynamic relationships between them, including mediators, publishers, concert promoters, and scholars. I am particularly interested in examining the media terrain through which popular music moves in search of listeners, and explaining the way that its topography shapes the publics that accrue to particular styles. The fragmented, highly idiosyncratic nature of local media systems has long made for a public sphere that is divided into competing subsectors, often organized around social boundaries of class, race, gender, and age set. Meanwhile, the growing saturation of urban environments by musical sound means that musical consumption has become a central means by which the members of particular publics recognize one another, and develop a purposive sense of intersubjectivity. Especially during times of demographic or technological change, when existing social boundaries dissolve and new communicative means provide methods of organizing new kinds of audiences, mass-mediated music, which is both pervasive and cheap to produce, circulate, and consume, readily provides new possibilities for rethinking musical genres as well as the nature of the listenerships that they gather.<br /><br />I have treated such issues in my previous work on Peruvian huayno music, a folkloric style from the country\'s Andean highlands, which has long been a central site of subject formation for mestizo citizens in the country\'s provincial regions. As Peru\'s demographic weight shifted from the rural highlands to the coastal capital after midcentury, huayno music was increasingly industrialized in Lima, its musical parameters and its context of performance changing in response to the emergence of an unprecedented Andean middle class. I focused on the musical and social ideologies that surround huayno music from the Andean city of Ayacucho, showing how Ayacuchano intellectuals of the early twentieth century made their city\'s style into the dominant sonic emblem of elite mestizo identity. These associations were repurposed toward the end of the twentieth century, when a rising middle class of humbler origin came to treat the genre as a site of conspicuous, cosmopolitan consumption congruent with its emergent social position. Placing the actions of record labels and radio DJs acted at the center of this shift, I demonstrated that processes of sociomusical change cannot be understood without attending to the everyday actions of those mediators who sit at the nodes of the networks connecting listeners to musicians, and sounds to ideologies of self and other.<br /><br />My current book project focuses on the transnational circulation of Andean indigenous music, and the cultural ideologues who shape the nature and the reception of indigenous artists\' work. Touching on topics ranging from Andean New Age and heavy metal music in Peru and Europe, to the cultural revivalist efforts of NGOs based in the country, to images of indigenous musical performance in contemporary and classic film, it aims to explore the ways that Peruvian artists and intellectuals are rethinking the very nature of indigeneity, in response to both the rising power of an internationalized indigenous politics, as well as the longstanding global market in images of indigenous culture.<br /><br />I am also currently beginning a project that examines the relation between musical genre and cultural change, centered on Brazilian choro music, which coalesced among the middle and lower classes of Rio de Janeiro during the city\'s late-19th century "Belle Epoque." I am particularly interested in the way that a series of informal and loosely-coordinated musical practices came to be perceived and consumed as a new genre, in a time when scholars and organic intellectuals increasingly debated the nature of the Brazilian nation and the proper constitution of its citizenry. I also mean to interrogate the way that the subsequent narrativization of choro\'s essential brasilidade, reiterated and reinforced across several waves of musical revival, has marginalized other aspects of the musical and cultural milieu within which its founding artists moved, and which may provide alternate avenues for conceptualizing both choro music and fin-de-si&#232;cle Rio de Janeiro.'

S"The experimental work by my group in the past several years has concerned: 1) testing whether previously proposed constitutive relations adequately describe rock friction in laboratory experiments, 2) experimentally determining the values of the constitutive parameters in these relations, and 3) testing whether theories of instability that employ these constitutive relations agree with observations of stability behavior in the experimental setting. We have found that the stability theories work well and we are able to understand quantitatively the transition from stick-slip to stable sliding in the laboratory. However, the constitutive descriptions only describe the behavior over more limited ranges of velocity than we have studied experimentally or are important in nature, and thus they represent only a partial description of constitutive behavior. Consequently we are attempting to measure the frictional response at intermediate slip velocities with and without pore fluid and are building equipment to slide at higher rates in the future. With pore fluid shear heating can cause the pore pressure to rise and thus the shear resistance to fall. Without pore fluid, shear melting can occur &#150; this is expected during earthquakes, but it does not occur at the rates we can now attain. Both processes could be important in allowing dynamic stress drops during earthquakes to be larger than static stress drops and can be important in affecting the magnitude of accelerations at the earthquake source and consequently the magnitude of the damage-causing strong ground motions.<br /><br />To do the laboratory friction measurements I have designed and built a unique high-pressure rotary shear gas apparatus &#150; for the past 30 years I have been using and improving this machine. I am now modifying it so that we can slide at seismic slip rates of 1 meter per second. To do this at 100 MPa normal stress requires 80 horsepower, and the current electric motor and hydraulic power supply can only deliver 10 HP &#150; this is what presently limits us to only intermediate slip rates. Consequently, I have purchased a 100 HP motorcycle engine and I am partway through designing a way to adapt this to the rotary shear apparatus so we can slide at seismic slip rates and investigate the new processes that are expected to occur at these more rapid rates. I have also nearly finished building the sample assembly parts that incorporate an internal furnace so we can do experiments in rotary shear at both high pressure and elevated ambient temperature &#150; the most complex of the parts have already been constructed by our machinist.<br /><br />The constitutive relations we presently use to describe the frictional response are primarily derived empirically from experimental data and are not based upon an understanding of the micromechanical processes that operate during frictional sliding. This is an unsatisfactory situation, both from the point of view of gaining a true understanding of the observed phenomena and that of applying laboratory observations to natural faults. One of the principal difficulties is that the processes that cause frictional resistance in rocks are not really known. Various possible processes have been proposed, in part by analogy with friction in metals, but the relative importance of these for rocks is unknown. One of the major continuing efforts I am engaged in is to try to understand the processes that operate and the implications these have for the constitutive behavior, both in the laboratory and on natural faults. This is an important problem, but a difficult one. The difficulties arise in part because it is hard to make observations of the samples on the scale at which the frictional resistance occurs. One of the important processes in frictional resistance is probably adhesion acting across very small areas of contact. In order to understand the role played by adhesion, I have been investigating the effect of chemical environment on frictional behavior, since recent advances in understanding intermolecular and surface forces suggest that different chemical environments should show different tendencies for attraction and repulsion between surfaces. I am also investigating the quantitative role played by small changes in the thickness of the fault zone and whether these may demonstrate that time-dependent indentation creep is responsible for the changes in friction that occur with time and velocity. This part of my planned research involves fundamental materials science and also has important practical applications for understanding the earth.<br /><br />I also initiated a series of indentation experiments on quartz in a variety of chemical environments in order to determine whether the time dependencies observed in rock friction could be due to plastic flow of contact points. More work on this has been conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory with Dr. David Goldsby, an Associate Professor, Research at Brown. <br /><br />In the last few years I have been conducting research on numerical modeling of fault behavior using constitutive descriptions of fault zone materials obtained from laboratory experiments. This is not only interesting in helping to understand the behavior of faults, it can be of value in determining the extent to which earthquake prediction can be aided by accurate constitutive descriptions. With the availability of increased computer power it is becoming more feasible to study realistic three dimensional models. I have made three dimensional instability models of the series of characteristic earthquakes that occur at Parkfield, California, and have made videos of these models to aid in understanding their complex behavior. This was intended to evaluate whether the model of Parkfield earthquakes could be predicted by existing arrays of field instruments in the presence of earth noise, something that does not seem possible. This numerical modeling of earthquakes suggests that although accelerating slip probably occurs at the earthquake hypocenter prior to the main earthquake, its magnitude may be too small to detect from the ground surface by most measurement methods. However, foreshocks are likely to occur as part of the accelerating slip process and, if they can be identified, they could form the basis for predicting the earthquake. I am interested in working with NASA to determine whether the space-based geodetic methods of GPS and INSAR might be able to detect the small displacements of the Earth's surface that we expect will precede some earthquakes.<br /><br />I have become involved with a group of other scientists who are interested in trying to understand earthquakes through a combination of simulations of earthquakes and analysis of a wide variety of observations made of the earth that are relevant to earthquake occurrence and prediction. This group was intitally called GEM (General Earthquake Models) and I was the cochairman of the GEM Committee on Simulations. As part of this GEM effort I have attended eight workshops and have taken the lead in applying some advanced computation methods (Fast Multipoles) to this earthquake modeling effort so that we should be able to make much more realistic models using parallel processing on large supercomputers. My results so far on using this method suggest that it is possible to make models with enough elements that we can properly represent a continuum and can simulate microearthquakes as well as major ones in the same model. As part of this the GEM group received a 3-year, $2.2 million grant from NASA that allowed us to make some substantial progress solving these problems. As my part of this I have completed the programming and the code improvement that involves converting the earthquake code to run in parallel using MPI. Documentation on this is publicly available at http://www.servogrid.org/slide/GEM/PARK/ as one of the computer codes on the web site set up by our group. A subsequent evolution of this group into QuakeSim (http://quakesim.jpl.nasa.gov/) has provided a framework for continued efforts and obtaining grants."

S'I focus on understanding the mechanics of earthquakes. This involves a combination of lab experiments on the frictional behavior of rock and computer modeling of earthquakes that employs the constitutive relations that arise from the lab experiments. Computer modeling is used to determine if there are any signals that might be used for short - or intermediate - term earthquake prediction. We are trying to understand the processes responsible for the observed frictional behavior.'

Her early prospective work identified behavioral and psychological markers of the later development of schizophrenia and eating disorders.  More recently, she has focused on stress reactivity and neuroendocrine function as a marker of risk for mood and anxiety disorders.  Her research involves two major types of investigations: 1) studies of the biological, psychological, and social underpinnings of mood and anxiety disorders, and 2) studies of the efficacy of novel treatments for mood disorders. She is conducting several investigations of subjects at risk for mood and anxiety disorders by virtue of their family history, genotype, neuroendocrine reactivity, or adverse experiences.  These potentially vulnerable individuals are studied in comparison to patients with major depression and healthy controls with regard to genes linked to depression and stress reactivity, neuroendocrine function, history of adverse life experiences, social support, personality and emerging psychiatric symptomatology.  The goal of this work is to discover individual factors and interactions among factors that produce risk for mood and anxiety disorders and, ultimately, to use this information to guide prevention and treatment efforts.  A second line of research involves efforts to advance the treatment of major depression.  Our group has investigated several new treatments for depression, including novel pharmacologic and neurostimulation approaches to the treatment of major depression and treatment resistant depression."

S"Valles' group performs research in two distinct areas:  low temperature condensed matter physics and biological physics.    <br /><br />The condensed matter physics research focuses on uncovering and exploring the properties of the possible phases, such as superconducting, insulating, or magnetic, that metals assume at very low temperatures.  Which phase emerges in a given system can be determined by a subtle interplay of its geometry, its microscopic structure and whether or not it is in a magnetic field.  Most recently, Valles has focused on  films of metals that are so thin that they exhibit two dimensional properties.  Some of these come with their own nanostructure, while others are patterned with features on the scale of nanometers.  The specific topics that this research addresses are the two dimensional superconductor to insulator and superconductor to metal transitions, localization phenomena, proximity effects in mesoscopic systems, and the physics of thin film growth on low temperature and nanostructured substrates.<br /><br />Biological physics work in the Valles lab has been directed at developing the use of intense, static magnetic fields as a means of manipulating biological systems.  They have shown that cell division in frog eggs, the swimming of microorganisms, and biopolymerization phenomena can be modified and investigated with static magnetic fields."

S"Autologous adult human skeletal muscle cells have numerous potential cell transplantation applications, including regenerating heart and skeletal muscle, and for therapeutic protein delivery when genetically engineered to express a recombinant protein. Human myoblasts offer a number of advantages over other cell types for implantation therapies, including a readily available cell source, ease of growth in vitro, and strong safety profile when implanted in humans. In addition, postmitotic muscle fibers formed from myoblasts are long lived (decades), have a high protein synthetic capacity, and the postmitotic muscle fibers (myofibers) are nonmigratory, making treatment reversibility possible (an attractive safety feature). But when implanted as either proliferating myoblasts or differentiated muscle fibers, loss of cell viability and/or function occurs. Our project examines the survival and functionality of human muscle cells transplanted as either proliferating myoblasts or differentiated myofibers into an immunodeficient murine model. Primary human myoblasts isolated by needle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle of volunteers are bioengineered into either human 'bioartificial muscles' (HBAMs) containing organized postmitotic muscle fibers in a collagen gel or as a disorganized but tensioned muscle cell layer on bioresorbable polymer scaffolds (MBPS). Proliferating myoblasts, HBAM and MBPS are implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice. Muscle cell survival as well as transcriptional/translational activity is determined over a two month period and correlated with implant vascularization. Development of a functional interface between cell implants and host blood vessels is assessed by immunohistochemistry, laser doppler perfusion imaging, fluorescent microsphere perfusion, and secretion of recombinant proteins into the systemic circulation. Survival and performance of the implanted cells is studied following the local delivery of angiogenic/vasculogenic/anabolic proteins either short term by their release from the scaffold polymer, or long term by genetically engineering the muscle cells with replication deficient viral vectors. It is hypothesized that ex vivo differentiated and genetically 'enhanced' skeletal muscle fibers that are rapidly vascularized will provide the best functional skeletal muscle implant technology. Successful completion of this project will be a step toward the development of improved methods for skeletal muscle cell transplantation for the treatment of numerous endocrine, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular disorders."

S'Herv&#233; Vanel is a scholar of contemporary art who first came to Brown in 2001 and has since continued teaching in History of Art and Architecture. He was educated at the Sorbonne, earning an M.A. (1992), a D.E.A. (1993) and a Ph.D. (2001). He offers introductory survey courses devoted to the history of art after 1945 and more specialized seminars in this field. His current research investigates critically the utopian visions of an emancipated artistic community as it developed during the second half of the 1960s in order to evaluate, through the archeology of our recent past, the contemporary developments of visual music and the infatuation for relational aesthetics. His publications include essays on Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Mel Bochner, Andy Warhol and John Cage.'

For me, this means applying epidemiological and statistical analysis to the growing body of evidence-based literature for the newborn, and bringing the identified best practices to our current policies.  Then as a medical educator, I enjoy developing curriculum to support the dissemination of this knowledge to the pediatric residents and medical students who learn with me each week in the Newborn Nursery. <br />&#9;My major research interests are medical education, breastfeeding, survey methodology, and public health.

S'The main focus of my research is the medieval Spanish epic and historiography, and my main aim is to ask what forms oral narrative takes, what work it does in the world, and how. My past and current research is also concerned with two essential problems: first, the relationship between epic and history, or the relation between "just another story about the past" and historical "facts"; and secondly, the phenomenon of "transitional literacy" or how scribal records show evidence of oral modes of thought. My research&#151;and teaching--is basically historical and philological in orientation, although my work tends to be eclectic and interdisciplinary.<br /><br />My monograph on Fern&#225;n P&#233;rez de Guzm&#225;n is the product of serendipity. Like my book on <i>Tradiciones orales</i> (1990) it was triggered by discovery of an unknown or ignored manuscript. Fern&#225;n P&#233;rez is a major intellectual figure in 15th century letters. His library was known to us partially, only through a short and incomplete catalogue preserved in an 18th-century manuscript. The manuscript I edited in my recent book contains his last will and testament from 1463, which includes the entire catalogue of his library, with a description of the value of its contents and, in some cases, the physical appearance of its volumes. I study this library in the context of other seigneurial collections that belonged to other "grandes familias" that controlled the political destinies of Castile in the 15th century. The manuscript is also a gem because it gives us extensive biographical information about Fern&#225;n P&#233;rez, which was previously unknown. It should be of great value to historians and other scholars of 15th century Castile. <br /><br />Several of my contributions interweave many of the issues that have concerned me over the years (epic, historiography, orality, and women). My recent book on women and the epic (<i>La mujer en la &#233;pica castellano-leonesa en su contexto hist&#243;rico</i>) is partly a result of my research on the epic over the years, and partly the result of teaching several courses on women and the epic. The hypothesis of the monograph, which synthesizes this work, is as follows: the origins of the primitive Castilian-Leonese epic songs can be found in the Imperial program of King Fernando I of Castile and Queen Sancha of Le&#243;n in the 11th century, and these songs were probably recreated in the first half of the 13th century, when king Fernando III of Castile 1217-52 and of Le&#243;n 1230-52, planned and almost fulfilled his Imperial program.<br /><br />I am currently at work on two studies and editions: first, a 15th-century prosification of the <i>Poema de Fernan Gonzalez, and second, the Cantar de Sancho II</i>. Another research project with which I am involved is the study of private libraries of the late Spanish Middle Ages.'

S'I am interested in the mechanics of soft materials: from self-assembled bilayer membranes to structured fluids such as emulsions and blood. My early work has focused on surfactant monolayers at interfaces, in particular, dynamic surface tension and non-Newtonian rheology of surfactant-laden emulsions. During my six years as an Assistant Professor, I have started my independent research program exploring the non-equilibrium dynamics of biomimetic membranes with a goal of understanding a wide range of problems such as pathological blood rheology, electro -poration and -fusion of biological cells, electric-fields-directed cell migration, and design of vesicles for biomedical applications such as drug delivery. <br /><br />Membranes play a central role in living systems: all cells are encapsulated by membranes; membranes divide the eukaryotic cell into compartments to sequester specific cellular functions; membranes are the sites where many cellular machineries carry out their tasks. Since living cells function out-of-equilibrium and are constantly subjected to stresses (e.g. cells in the blood flow), the non-equilibrium behavior of membranes is emerging as an important open problem at the forefront of biophysics research. <br /><br />My research contributions include the development of a novel framework that combines theory and experiment to interrogate several fundamental non-equilibrium problems: membranes in external flow and electric fields, multicomponent and active membranes. Currently, I am exploring three topics of particular interest:<br /><br />1. Electro-mechanics of biomembranes<br /><br />&#9;Living cells actively maintain electrochemical potentials across their membranes. Changes in the transmembrane electric field are biologically important signals underlying many physiological processes such as signal propagation in neurons via action potentials, electric-fields-directed cell migration in development and regeneration, and ciliary motility in cell swimming. <br /><br />The plasma membrane plays a central role in establishing the electric properties of a cell, through its regulation of the transport of ions between the extracellular and intracellular spaces. Using giant unilamellar vesicles (cell-size membrane envelopes) as model system we carry out fundamental theoretical and experimental studies on the membranes response to electric fields. This allows us to gain insights into the biophysical aspects of the interaction of cells and electric fields.<br /><br />In AC fields, vesicles exhibit a frequency dependent shape deformation, which we have exploited as a facile and non-invasive method to measure the membrane capacitance. In DC fields, the membrane undergoes transient instability, which can lead to appearance of ``corners,\'\' poration, and vesicle burst. Our theoretical analysis of the coupling between transmembrane potential and membrane deformation shows that the capacitor charging controls membrane dynamics. In addition, in order to identify features specific to the electrohydrodynamics of biomembranes, in parallel we study ``simple" interfaces (drops); we find surprisingly complex particle behaviors in uniform electric fields -- rotation, oscillations, and even chaos.<br /><br />This research provides a foundation for future investigation into the active electric properties of excitable cells. In a broader perspective, it may lead to new insights into improving biomedical technologies that employ membrane electroporation (e.g., cell fusion) and  engineering artificial neurons.<br /><br />2. Mechanics of multicomponent biomembranes<br /><br />&#9;Membranes in eukaryotic cells are composed of hundreds of lipid species, and the reason for this lipid diversity remains one of the puzzles in cell biology. Almost 15 years ago it was proposed that membrane rafts, which are dynamic, nanoscale, ordered assemblies of lipids and proteins, function as a membrane organizing platform in cellular processes such as signaling.  Nowadays, the raft paradigm has evolved to include membrane structures that span from nano- to micro- scales.<br /><br />Raft formation is  strongly influenced by changes in physico-chemical variables such as membrane composition, temperature, and tension. To this date, only lipid demixing induced by adjusting the temperatureof lipid bilayers of appropriate composition has been studied. Tension (which is a two-dimensional analog of pressure) is a more natural regulator of membrane phase behavior in the living cell, where temperature variations are minimal. Yet, tension has received limited attention because it is difficult to control its variation. To overcome this problem, we plan to use electric fields and microfluidic flows to create well-defined and reproducible tension conditions.  We have started a new experimental project on the tension-induced microdomain formation in model membranes with composition mimicking the membranes of living cells.<br /><br />The knowledge gained from this work will lead to a better understanding of the morphological consequences of bilayer phase separation, which can benefit the development of bioengineering applications that exploit the cell signaling and trafficking machinery, e.g., targeted drug delivery.<br /><br />3. Mechanics of red blood cells and blood flow in the microcirculation<br /><br />Blood flow in the microcirculation is an extensively studied problem, yet the behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) continues to surprise researchers. For example, recently it was discovered that in steady shear flow RBCs not only tank-tread or tumble, but can also ``swing" (tank-treading accompanied by oscillations in the inclination angle). My analytical and numerical work explains this behavior and other features in the RBCs dynamics.<br /><br />In steady shear flows, the theory shows that a closed incompressible membrane (capsule or RBC) deforms into an ellipsoid, which tumbles at low shear rates, and swings at high shear rates. The amplitude of the oscillations decreases with shear rate. Vesicles (made of lipid bilayer membranes) do not swing unless they enclose a nonspherical particle. In quadratic flows, vesicles and RBCs always migrate towards the flow centerline unlike drops, whose direction of migration depends on the viscosity ratio. The theory also predicts that  the viscosity of dilute suspension of vesicles/RBCs  attains a minimum at the tank-treading to tumbling transition, which can serve as a method to determine cell properties such as internal viscosity.<br /><br />My work to date was focused on individual vesicles and healthy RBCs.  In the future, I am interested in exploring the dynamics of diseased RBCs and rheology of concentrated RBC suspensions'

S"The goal of the Language and Behavioral Outcomes of Children with Congenital Hearing Loss: Family Perspective Study II project is to prospectively examine the language, communication, behavior and adaptive skills of early identified children with minimal (unilateral or bilateral < 40 dB) hearing loss (Min HL) and children with moderate-to-profound bilateral (&#8805; 40 dB) hearing loss (Mod HL) compared to typically hearing children at 24, 36, and 48 months, and to identify the child, family, and intervention characteristics which contribute to optimized outcomes. This is a continuation of comprehensive evaluation of this cohort at 6, 12, and 18 months of age. There is increasing evidence that unilateral and mild/minimal hearing loss < 40 dB impact negatively on academic and language outcomes at school age. The school age outcome data on mild and unilateral HL is important on two counts. First, current screening protocols based on a target threshold of 40 dB may not identify these infants, and second, in some states even if identified, these infants are not eligible for intervention services. There is no data available on the outcomes of early identified infants with Min HL. We have been evaluating prospectively a cohort of children with Min HL, Mod HL, and typically hearing controls at 6, 12, and 18 months of age. In this continuation we will complete comprehensive evaluations at 24, 36, and 48 months. The specific aims are: 1) to assess the longitudinal development of receptive and expressive language, behavior, and adaptive skills; 2) to evaluate effects of the onset and frequency/quality of participation of early intervention (EI) on child language, behavior, and adaptive skills; 3) to evaluate the communicative effectiveness of mother-child dyads and assess its relationship with child receptive and expressive language, behavior, and adaptive skills; and 4) to evaluate the effects of maternal environmental factors and child factors (degree of HL, entry to Early Intervention, co-morbidities) on child outcomes. The three primary hypotheses are: 1) children with bilateral moderate-to-profound HL (Mod HL) will have lower language, adaptive scores than children with unilateral or mild bilateral HL (Min HL) and children with typical hearing; 2) language and behavior scores of children with Min HL will diverge from those of typically hearing children with increasing age; and 3) children with both Min and Mod HL enrolled in EI &#8804; 3 months, and whose parents have frequent and positive experiences in EI, will have better language, behavior, and adaptive skill development than those enrolled after 3 months of age.<br /><br />Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or hemorrhage into the germinal matrix tissues of the developing brain, results in significant neurodevelopmental handicap. Our multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that indomethacin significantly lowered the evidence and decreased the severity of IVH in those very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants with no evidence for IVH at 6 to 12 postnatal hours, our primary analysis population. A secondary trial conducted at the same time showed no effect of indomethacin for the prevention of existing IVH. Indomethacin has recently been demonstrated to have gender-mediated effects. Although a gender-by-indomethacin effect was not an a priori hypothesis of the application, reanalysis of our data demonstrated that the indomethacin-IVH effect occurred exclusively in male infants. Children randomized to indomethacin had better long-term survival, and male indomethacin subjects exhibited better verbal testing scores during their early grade school years than male placebo children, suggesting this neonatal intervention may produce a long-lasting effect on developmental skills in VLBW preterm infants. <br /><br />The purpose of the study is to understand the learning abilities of children born prematurely who have been participating in our multicenter trial to reduce the incidence of brain hemorrhage in preterm infants. Previous assessments were done at 3, 4-1/2, 6, 8, and for some children at 12 years of age.<br /><br />A neurological, developmental, behavioral, and attention assessment will be completed at 12 years and 16 years. The neurological assessment evaluates coordination and reflexes. The developmental assessment evaluates language, overall knowledge, perception, attention, memory skills, reading, and mathematics. A psychometrist will administer the tests, and a developmental pediatrician will do the neurological. Most tests are similar to those done at the previous visit. The developmental tests will take 120-180 minutes and the neurological exam will take about 30 minutes. The mother will complete questionnaires about her child's behavior, which will take about 60 minutes. Speech language testing will take 60 to 90 minutes. <br /><br />The proposal is a reapplication from the Brown Medical School to participate in the Cooperative Multi-Center Neonatal Research Network (RFA-HD-04-010). Abbot Laptook, M.D., will serve as the Principle Investigator, the Co-Investigator (Alternate) will be William Oh, M.D., and the Follow-up Investigator will be Betty Vohr, M.D. The primary teaching hospital of Brown for this proposal is Women and Infants' Hospital of Rhode Island (WIHRI). The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of WIHRI has a 60+ bed capacity and serves as the sole level III NICU in Southeastern New England. Adjoining WIHRI is Hasbro Children's Hospital, which provides all needed specialized pediatric services for radiologic, surgical, and other subspecialty services. There are a number of considerations that justify Brown as one of the sites for the Network. First, Brown is the sole regional provider of perinatal services in Southeastern New England and thus provides a population that represents a geographic region. The stability of the number of deliveries, number of infants with a birth weight < 1500 grams, and referrals of high-risk pregnancies demonstrate a well-organized regional perinatal care system with established referral lines among the obstetric and pediatric communities. Second, the Brown site has a proven record within the Network. It has been a member institution since 1991 and continues to have a well-organized research team with a high percent of eligible infants enrolled in randomized trials, limited errors in conducting studies, complete data acquisition, and an almost 90% follow-up rate. Third, the Brown site has an outstanding trio of investigators in Drs. Laptook, Oh, and Vohr, who are experienced in clinical research and provide expertise in multiple areas critical for the success of the Network. Finally, the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at Brown has a strong commitment to clinical research. This commitment is reflected among the NICU staff at WIHRI who have come to expect patient participation in clinical research. The Brown site and WIHRI has made many important contributions to advance perinatal care over the last 30 years both as a single institution and in collaboration with other academic centers. Participation in the Neonatal Research Network provides the ideal forum to perform interventional and observational studies of neonates, and achieve a divisional and institutional goal to advance neonatal care though rigorous research and evidenced based medicine."

S"My research takes place at the intersection of three fields in American history: Civil War and Reconstruction; Legal and Constitutional History; and Slavery, Emancipation, and Race.  My first book, <i>Final Freedom: The Civil War, the Abolition of Slavery, and the Thirteenth Amendment</i> (Cambridge, 2001), dealt with the making and meaning of the Thirteenth Amendment, the measure that outlawed slavery in the United States, but the larger subject was the way that popular attitudes toward race and the law collided with unanticipated effects of the Civil War to create a movement for a reworking of the constitutional order.  Under this new order, Americans came to believe that they were empowered to change the Constitution, even though it was viewed by many as the product of irretrievable wisdom if not divine inspiration.  With this new appreciation of the legitimacy of altering or amending the Constitution, Americans gained faith in their ability to shape the power of the state and the definition of who was American.  <br /><br />In my second book project, <i>Reconstructing the People: The Invention of Citizenship During the American Civil War</i>, I continue in a similar vein by examining how elite and ordinary members of the Union and the Confederacy during the Civil War strove for the first time in American history to translate latent notions of citizenship into law, policy, and manifest belief.  The project already has been awarded a major grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, which provided me with a two-semester leave from teaching to work on the project, as well as a summer stipend from the National Endowment for the Humanities and a short-term fellowship from the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts. <br /><br />I have prepared for publication three articles based on this new work. The first examines the connection between racial and constitutional thinking in nineteenth-century America; the second examines disputes over Mexican and American landholding rights in the far West during the Civil War; and the third examines oath-taking and African Americans' acquisition of the right of testifying as witnesses during the Civil War era.  I have presented some of the research involved in these articles and the larger book in lectures at Northwestern University Law School, The Nevada Law School, and the annual meetings of the American Society for Legal History and the Southern Historical Association.  <br /><br />In addition, I am under contract with Bedford Books/St. Martin's Press for a book on The Emancipation Proclamation.  Finally, I have written two essays reflecting on my research in the context of the current state of the field of legal and constitutional history during the Civil War and Reconstruction era.  The first of these essays was published in <i>The Democratic Experiment: The Promise of American Political History</i>, edited by Meg Jacobs, William Novak, and Julian Zelizer (Princeton, 2003), and the second will appear in a volume titled <i>Reconstructions</i>, edited by Thomas Brown (Oxford, 2006)."

S'In magnetic resonance imaging, field gradients are used for spatial encoding of the signals.  A Fourier transform model is used to convert the data into the spatial domain for viewing of images.  Difficulties with this model are that signal decay (a normal process) and local field gradients (arising in the tissue, especially near air-tissue interfaces) are not taken into account.  Consequences include geometric distortion (which can result in misregistration of activation locations when mapping to anatomic reference images) and signal voids (no activation detection possible).  The SS-PARSE techniques (Single-Shot Parameter Assessment by Retrieval from Signal Encoding) discards the Fourier transform model and instead casts the image reconstruction procedure as a nonlinear optimization process with the goal of providing an inverse solution to the MRI signal equation.  Parametric maps of magnetization, decay rate, and frequency (a field map) are provided as the final solution in the reconstruction process.  We are therefore able to map relaxation rate changes associated with the BOLD effect directly, rather than observing contrast changes in a conventional echo planar image as a consequence of the BOLD effect.  Since frequency (field variation) is taken into account in the optimization process, geometric fidelity is enforced without any postprocessing.<br /><br />An active program in nanoparticle contrast agent development is underway in the Chemistry Department at Brown.  Variations of the PARSE technique are being considered for the rapid mapping of relaxation rates associated with nanoparticle agent uptake.  This work will provide a means of rapidly assessing agent distribution and will permit time-resolved studies of agent uptake.'

S'The Liver Research Center is a newly constructed 13,000-sq. ft. facility that will emphasize studies relating to the molecular biology of liver diseases. There are numerous ongoing studies that relate to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma as well as a major effort in gene therapy of liver diseases. For example, we investigate the relationship of chronic hepatitis B and C infection and hepatocellular carcinoma at the molecular level. Of particular interest is the generation of naturally occurring viral variants that are produced during active viral replication or immune selection by the host. These mutations convey different biologic properties as compared to "wild type" virus. Such viral variants have different biologic properties including the development of viral latency, low level viral gene expression, increased virulence, vaccine escape, and integration into the hepatocyte cellular DNA.<br /><br />With respect to chronic hepatitis B infection, there are ongoing studies that examine the molecular mechanisms of viral integration into the cellular DNA during the development of cellular carcinoma with particular emphasis on hepatitis B viral variants. Attempts are being made to understand hepadnavirus hepatocyte cell surface receptor binding proteins. We are also interested in the functional role of the hepatitis Bx protein and these studies focus on cloning and characterizing liver specific proteins that interact with HBx. Such investigations may have relevance to the hepatocyte transformation process since HBx, in combination with cellular factors, acts as a transcriptional transactivator of many growth related genes. <br /><br />Studies are ongoing on the development of antiviral approaches to interfere with HBV and HCV replication. These approaches include antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, dominant negative mutants and therapeutic viral DNA based vaccines. In this context, there is a major effort to develop vectors to specifically deliver DNA constructs to the liver and thus there is a major program in gene therapy of viral diseases of the liver. In this regard, we are using several approaches that include receptor mediated endocytosis of targeted liposomes and use of various adenovirus, retrovirus, and adeno-associated virus constructs that express genes of interest in hepatocytes. Such approaches are also being applied to gene therapy of primary hepatocellular carcinoma using animal model systems.<br /><br />There is also a major focus in the study of growth regulation of hepatocytes through growth factor receptors and intracellular signal transduction pathways with particular emphasis on the insulin stimulated hepatocyte growth. The expression and tyrosyl phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) as well as activation of downstream MAP kinases are being studied in a variety of experimental systems as well as in human disease. Finally, the relationship of chronic HBV infection and activation of growth factor signal transduction cascade is being actively pursued at the molecular level.'

S'I am always interested in the theory and applications of probabilistic methods. My previous work was largely on mathematical finance, where many fundamental questions, such as option pricing and portfolio optimization, can be answered using the technical tools from stochastic optimization theory. My main contribution is the study of explicit solution to path-dependent options with a double exponential jump diffusion stock price, and the convex duality method for portfolio optimization in an incomplete semi-martingale financial market. <br /><br />Recently, I have been working on game-theoretic importance sampling (IS). Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique in Monte Carlo simulation, and can be especially effective when the quantities of interest are largely determined by rare events. Its basic idea is to sample the system under a different probability distribution, and the efficiency of the algorithm depends on the choice of this alternative sampling distribution, which is the central question of importance sampling. In close collaboration with Paul Dupuis, we introduced a game theoretic approach toward importance sampling, and showed that IS algorithms are intimately connected with a differential game. The corresponding Isaacs equation and its subsolutions can serve as a very useful tool for the design and analysis of IS algorithms. The significance of this game formulation is that, for the first time, it allows one to build a comprehensive framework within which one can systematically and rigorously construct efficient dynamic IS schemes. <br /><br />Much still remains to be done in the theory and applications of game-theoretic importance sampling. For example, one can consider the extension of importance sampling to different settings such as Jackson queuing networks, networks with Markov modulated arrival and service rates, and functionals of exit time and location for a small noise process in a region surrounding a stable rest point. Another interesting area I hope to investigate is the robust control for general queuing networks. There seem to be very few concrete, explicit results, especially in high dimensions. This difficulty is largely due to the dimensionality and the nature of constrained dynamics associated with such systems. I am interested in developing network models and cost structures such that a fairly complete characterization of the optimal policies are possible, regardless of dimension.'

S'Professor Lingzhen Wang\'s areas of expertise include modern Chinese literature and culture, Gender Studies, Feminist Theory, and Chinese cinema. Her first major research project centers on Chinese women\'s life and writing in the long, turbulent twentieth century. Her book, Personal Matters: Women\'s Autobiographical Practice in Twentieth-Century China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004) studies a group of both well known and lesser-known Chinese women writers in relation to dominant discourses of Chinese modernity&#151;nationalism, revolution, socialism, and market commodification&#151;and emphasizes aspects of women\'s experience, especially their subjective, emotional, psychic, and bodily activities, that tend to be dismissed in mainstream studies of history and literature. The book reconfigures Chinese women\'s autobiographical writing as an important means of self-negotiation and re-theorizes the concept of the personal in feminist and literary criticism. <br /><br />Professor Wang\'s second book project, Women Directing Films: History, Cinematic Authorship, and Feminisms in Modern China, focuses on gender and Chinese visual modernity, examining particularly the role of female film directors in constructing mainstream Chinese cinema and/or negotiating gendered and different spaces in the second half of the twentieth century. With emphatic attention to social and historical conditions and transformations in modern China, the project also critically reexamines existing feminist theories of gender and cinema, questioning and revising the prevalent Western feminist approaches to women directors and visual culture that are based on binary models of "sexual difference." She has published several articles on the following female film directors: Dong Kena, Huang Shuqin, Zhang Nuanxin, Hu Mei, and Ma Xiaoying. <br /><br />Her other research and writing projects include translations of Chinese women writers into English, a study of transnational feminism in the contemporary globalized world, and a critical re-examination of the socialist legacy on gender, politics, and identity formation.  <br /><br /><br />Prof. Wang\'s current project is titled <i>Women Directing Films: History, Cinematic Authorship, and Feminisms in Modern China </i>'

S'Bill Warren takes an ecological approach to problems of perception and action, which aims to see how much of the organization in behavior can be explained "for free" on the basis of informational and physical constraints in natural environments. His current research focuses on the visual content of locomotion and investigates the following questions: First, how do we perceive self-motion from patterns of optic flow? Computer displays that simulate motion through the world are manipulated to understand how the visual system determines one\'s path of self-motion.  Second, what are the visual control laws that govern human walking? Using a large Virtual Reality (VR) Lab (40\' x 40\'), experiments examine the on-line control of balance, braking, steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection in a world of stationary and moving objects.  Third, how might such principles be extended to longer-range navigation? A collaborative project with Michael Tarr and Leslie Kaebling uses the VR lab to study visual navigation and "cognitive maps" in humans and mobile robots.  Finally, how can control problems be simplified by exploiting the dynamics of the system? Experiments on this problem examine critical behavior near gait transitions, mode-locking between gait and posture, the dynamics of steering control, and stable behavior in infant bouncing. The ultimate aim of Dr. Warren\'s research is a dynamic theory of adaptive visual control.'

S"My research focuses on the visual control of action - in particular, human locomotion and navigation. On the one hand, I want to understand how motor behavior such as posture and gait become stably organized. On the other, I seek to explain how this behavior is adaptively regulated by visual information in complex environments. Using virtual reality techniques, my research team investigates problems such as the visual control of balance, steering, and obstacle avoidance during walking. This technology allows us to manipulate what human subjects see while walking through the virtual landscape, and to measure how they respond to this information. By using computer graphics, we test how the visual system determines one's future path of self-motion from information such as optic flow, in order to characterize the functions that the brain must perform. The ultimate aim of this research is to understand how adaptive behavior emerges from the dynamic interaction of an organism and its environment. I think the answers will not be found solely in the brain, but will also depend on the physical and informational regularities that the brain comes to exploit. This research contributes to a foundation of basic knowledge that is needed to understand visual-motor disorders and mobility problems in humans, and to develop mobile robots that can operate in novel environments such as the surface of Mars.<br /><br /><br />I became interested in this research as a doctoral candidate in experimental psychology at the University of Connecticut when it became clear to me that the function of vision is to control behavior. Early perceptual experiments led to my current interest in the link between vision and action."

S'In our global world, in which multinational companies constantly form or merge and in which people of diverse nationalities are increasingly asked to communicate and work together, the need to understand a culture other than one\'s own has become of paramount importance.<br /><br />We, as educators, must prepare our students for that new world and help them develop a deep understanding of these other cultures. This will no doubt be one of the most important skills graduates everywhere will need to possess in this new century. Now, more than ever, is the time to search for ways in which this new level of understanding of cultures around the world might be attained.<br /><br />One common assumption in the field of foreign languages instruction is that, when we teach language, we also automatically teach culture. We also commonly agree that the understanding of another culture is crucial. If we are going to have meaningful social interactions, we need to know and understand the different cultural value systems that shape our respective thoughts and actions. Yet teaching culture in the classroom (in the sense of behaviors, attitudes and values) is a very difficult task, since culture is a very elusive, often abstract, implicit and essentially invisible notion. What is needed is an approach and a tool for teaching these cultural ideas and relationships.<br /><br />One approach that seems promising is to start with the notion of cultural comparisons. As is well known, comparing and contrasting separate entities makes it possible to see differences and similarities that would not otherwise be visible. CULTURA offers this type of cross-cultural approach through which learners observe, compare and analyze similar materials from the two cultures studied. This approach allows them to start "seeing" the differences as well as similarities: the different values given to words, the negative or positive connotations, the various attitudes toward events or situations, etc. It constitutes the first step toward deciphering and understanding what these differences may reveal and signify.<br /><br />The tool that best serves our purpose is the World-Wide Web. We believe that interactive multimedia/ hypermedia bring forward, juxtapose and connect different types of materials. The sheer process of juxtaposition allows the similarities and differences between these materials to emerge, thus providing students with the unprecedented ability to see and identify underlying connotations, traits, and attitudes as well as discover, on their own, connections between different and separate elements. Additional materials include films, newspapers, and other cultural artifacts of any kind.<br /><br />The CULTURA project, originally designed at MIT and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, shows a concrete and dynamic way in which the Web can be used to foster understanding between two groups of students living in their own country. ALthough the initial focus of the project was to promote the cross-understanding of French and American cultures, CULTURA provides such a basic and broad methodology that it can easily and effectively be applied to the cross-understanding of any two cultures, whether they are national cultures, business cultures, or even sub-cultures. At Brown, it has been applied to French, Spanish, and Russian cultures within the framework of language classes. The original project team consisted of Gilberte Furstenberg (MIT), Sabine Levet (Brandeis) and Shoggy Waryn (Brown). At Brown, adaptation for Spanish was conducted by Beth Bauer and for Russian by Lynne Debenedette. <br /><br />The latest developments involve automation of questionnaires via a web-based interface, templates for users of WebCT and Blackboard, and expansion of the project to more campuses in the United States.'

S'Shoggy Waryn was born and educated in France where he received his MA in English from the University of Dijon. After moving to the United States, he received his Ph.D in Film studies from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a dissertation entitled : French Television, French Culture: State Television in the Age of Globalization.<br />He taught French at MIT for several years, developing a Web-based cross-cultural project, Cultura, which provides a unique comparative approach for understanding another culture. This project was created in collaboration with Gilberte Furstenberg and Sabine Levet and has grown to include many more colleagues from several universities.<br />At Brown, Shoggy teaches French language courses and French film classes. He has imported Cultura as a model for French and other languages notably Spanish (with Beth Bauer) and Russian (with Lynne Debenedette). He has also served as Resident Director of the Brown-in-France program in Paris.'

S'David Weil\'s primary field of interest is economic growth, a topic to which he has made both empirical and theoretical contributions. Weil\'s early work in this area (joint with Mankiw and Romer) was a path-breaking study of the causes of income differences among countries.  The paper identified differences in investment rates, population growth rates, and schooling as proximate determinants that explained a large fraction of the variance in income levels and growth rates among countries.  This was an enormously influential paper which has been cited more than 800 times in published work. <br /><br />In later research, Weil examined the individual determinants of growth in greater detail.   His papers with Carroll and Overland examined differences in saving rates among countries, arguing that high income growth raises the saving rate, which is a finding at odds with standard models of preferences.   They show that a model of habit formation utility is able to explain this finding.  Two theoretical papers with Galor examined the factors underlying fertility transition.  One paper looked in particular at the interaction of economic growth, fertility, and the wage gap between men and women.  The other paper examined the historical process by which economies moved from a Malthusian trap into an equilibrium of sustained growth.   Weil\'s paper with Ryder and Kalemli-Ozcan examined the link between declining mortality and increased schooling.   His paper with Basu examined the process of technology transfer between countries, paying particular attention to whether rich country inventions are appropriate to the mix of factors of production found in poor countries.   <br /><br />Weil\'s recent research in this area focuses on the interaction of population health and economic development.  His recent NBER working paper uses microeconomic estimates of the effect of health on individual outcomes to construct macroeconomic estimates of the proximate effect of health on GDP per capita.  He finds that the fraction of world income variance that  is explained by health is roughly the same as the share accounted for human capital from education, and larger than the share accounted for by physical capital. Another recent paper examines the effect of health improvements in explaining increased education, using the natural experiment of malaria eradication in Sri Lanka.  Weil has recently embarked on a new empirical project examining the long-run effects of a public-health intervention on the quality of workers.  The experiment he is examining is the iodization of salt in the United States, beginning in 1924.  Prior to this period, rates of goiter (a marker of iodine deficiency) in parts of the country such as the Great Lakes basin and the Pacific Northwest were as high as they are today in many developing countries.  <br /><br />Weil\'s textbook, <i>Economic Growth</i> (2005), brings together not only his own work, but that of many contemporaries who are working in the area of growth.  Although much of the labor that went into the book was pedagogical &#150; that is, making advanced material accessible to undergraduates &#150; the book also represents a new synthesis and intellectual approach to the field.   The book has been adopted as a primary text in many undergraduate courses, both in the United States and abroad.  It is also used by many professors to give graduate students a broad introduction to the field before delving into more advanced material.  <br /><br />Weil\'s second area of research is on the macroeconomic effects of demographic change, mostly in the context of developed countries.  Much of this work has examined both empirically and theoretically the implications of changes in the age structure of the population, and in particular population aging, for various macroeconomic aggregates.  His early work in this area examined the life cycle pattern of saving in both household level data and through cross-country regressions.  He also co-authored with Mankiw an influential paper examining the role that demographically-induced changes in demand play in affecting housing prices.  A recently published paper analyzes the effects of demographic change on the return to equities &#150; in particular whether the aging of the baby boom cohort contributed to high stock market returns in the 1990s, and whether there will be a corresponding meltdown in asset prices when the baby boomers begin to retire. <br /><br />Weil\'s recent work in this area includes a paper with Hock looking at the feedback from population aging to fertility, an issue which is particularly germane to Western Europe and Japan, where fertility rates are already low, and where the coming 25 years will see severe economic strains resulting from population aging.  His working paper with Kalemli-Ozcan goes to the other end of the life cycle, to ask what explains the boom in retirement over the course of the 20th century.  Their answer is that changes in adult mortality, which made living into old age more certain, are part of the story.  Weil is also working on a paper that unites his aging and growth interests by examining how population aging, by affecting the average "vintage" of the education of teachers, affects the appropriateness of the human capital embodied in workers, and thus the pace of economic growth.  <br /><br />In addition to his work in economic growth and demographic economics, Weil has written on assorted other topics, including the creation of the Social Security system in the United States, optimal portfolio allocation, the relationship between income inequality and intergenerational economic mobility, and various aspects of monetary policy.'

S'I work on the evolutionary genetics of biological adaptation, in theory and in laboratory populations of microbes.  <br /><b>I am actively seeking new lab members at all levels from High School interns to postdocs.  Please click the <b>Teaching</b> tab above and see the BIOL 1950/1960/2980 description for ongoing student projects.  <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/LabWebPages/WeinreichLab.htm">Click here </a> to visit the lab web page.   Or <a href="mailto:Daniel_Weinreich@Brown.edu">send me an email </a> describing your background and interests if you would like to join us.  </b><br /><br /><b> Background </b><br /><br />Some time ago I developed novel theory to describe the evolutionary constraints that that mutational interactions impose (<a href="http://webpub.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/WeinreichPublications/Weinreich2005.pdf" target="_blank">Weinreich 2005</A>, <a href="http://webpub.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/WeinreichPublications/WeinreichWatsonChao2005.pdf" target="_blank">Weinreich <i>et al.</i> 2005</A>, <a href="http://webpub.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/WeinreichPublications/WeinreichChao2005.pdf" target="_blank">Weinreich and Chao 2005</A>).  Specifically I pointed out that if mutation X unconditionally improves an organism\'s fitness but Y improves it only in the presence of X, a population\'s evolutionary trajectory would be constrainted because mutations would only be favored in some temporal order (here, Y must follow X).  We designated this form of mutational interaction <b>sign epistasis</b> (<a href="http://webpub.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/WeinreichPublications/WeinreichWatsonChao2005.pdf" target="_blank">Weinreich <i>et al.</i> 2005</A>).<br /><br />Microbes offer several technical advantages that render them an excellent experimental complement to this theoretical framework.  For example, the ease of reverse genetics in <i> E. coli</i> allowed us to construct all 32 combinations of five point mutations in a &#946;-lactamase gene known to jointly increase antibiotic resistance ~100,000-fold.  We showed that four of these five mutations exhibit sign epistasis and that as a result, only 18 of the 5! = 120 possible mutational trajectories to this high-resistance quintuple-mutant are selectively accessible (<a href="http://webpub.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/WeinreichPublications/Weinreich_etal2006.pdf" target="_blank">Weinreich <i>et al.</i> 2006</a>).<br /><br />This finding raises the question of mechanism: what are the functional interactions among these five mutations responsible for this sign epistasis?  A simple biophysical model of protein evolution suggests that sign epistasis may occur if mutations pleiotropically perturb multiple phenotypes, each under stabilizing selection (<a href="http://webpub.brown.edu/Research/Weinreich/WeinreichPublications/DePristoWeinreichHartl2005.pdf" target="_blank">DePristo, Weinreich and Hartl 2005</a>) and we are testing this hypothesis using &#946;-lactamase.  We imagine that the drug resistance conferred by each &#946;-lactamase sequence may be decomposed into it\'s expression level, it\'s protein product\'s folding stability, enzymatic properties, etc.  <br /><br />This and several other current projects are detailed under <b>RESEARCH PROJECTS</b> at the top of this page.'

S'Professor Weitz-Shapiro\'s research aims to understand variation in the quality of representation and accountability within new democracies. As many third-wave democracies enter their second or even third decade of existence, concerns about national democratic consolidation have waned. Nonetheless, in a number of these countries, free and fair elections coexist with democracy-distorting practices that raise serious questions about the quality of democracy that citizens experience. Professor Weitz-Shapiro\'s completed and ongoing projects seek to understand the conditions under which phenomena that diminish the quality of representation and accountability can survive&#151;-or even thrive&#151;-in competitive electoral environments.<br /><br />Weitz-Shapiro\'s research is particularly attuned to the difficulty of measuring these accountability-diminishing practices, many of which are informal, illegal, or intentionally hidden from public view. In her research, she has collected original data using survey experiments, elite surveys, and in-depth interviews. In addition, much of her work has employed subnational data collection.<br /><br />Weitz-Shapiro has recently completed a book manuscript that focuses on the phenomenon of political clientelism: the individualized exchange of goods and services for political support. The manuscript, "Choosing clientelism: politics, poverty, and social policy in Argentina," asks why, within the same country, state, and even political party, some politicians rely on clientelism while others opt not to.  Weitz-Shapiro argues that political competition has mixed consequences for politician incentives to employ clientelism: only when high competition is coupled with low poverty do politicians opt out of clientelism. She support this hypothesis using results of a survey of policy implementation in over 120 Argentine municipalities, a mass survey experiment, and qualitative interviews.<br /><br />A second project (joint with Matthew S. Winters, UI-UC), currently underway, seeks to understand when and why citizens will punish political corruption. In the first stage of this project, the authors fielded an experiment embedded into a nationally-representative survey in Brazil. Their initial findings show that, contrary to popular opinion that Brazilian voters are tolerant of corruption, Brazilian citizens reject politicians who are described as having engaged in corrupt acts, even when these politicians perform well in other areas.'

These psychophysical experiments are carried out on adult humans.

This best performance can be compared across tasks in order to assess what information is actually used to do a specific discrimination or detection.<br /><br />I am especially interested in how we perceive the speed and direction of objects in motion. My approach to studying motion perception includes trying to discover the motion system's limitations and determining what those limitations can tell us about how the system works. I am also interested in how we determine the relative position of objects in dept and how differences in relative depth can influence what shapes observers see. These different kinds of information (among many others) are integrated by the visual system to form a unified perception of the world, since we do not perceive motion information as distinct from position information for the same object. Interactions between the different processes can tell us how the different types of information are combined.<br /><br />The goal of my research is to discover the mechanisms the brain uses to solve perceptual problems. The visual system is a convenient system to work with because the input can be defined very precisely.

S"Fertilization and the block to polyspermy: Sperm-egg interactions result in a cascade of responses including exocytosis of cortical granules. This secretory event functions in the permanent block to polyspermy, important for fertilization, and in the formation of a protected environment for early embryonic development. We study the function of cortical granules in the modification of the egg cell surface and extracellular matrix using a molecular analysis of the protease and peroxidase activities, the structural proteins of the fertilization envelope, and the major protein of the extraembryonic matrix, hyalin.<br /><br />Signaling Mechanisms in Oogenesis, Meiotic Maturation, and Fertilization: We examine the signal transduction pathways leading to normal cell function. These pathways target the release of free calcium into the cytoplasm, the generation of nitric oxide, and resumption of the cell cycle. We find a network of interacting molecular machines that include heterotrimeric G-proteins, and use yeast two-hydrid approaches to identify new components of each pathway. <br /><br />Oocyte-Specific Transcriptional Mechanisms: Oocytes make several organelles specific to their cell type and transcribe a host of genes not active in any other cell. Some of these genes make the most abundant transcripts in the cell, which are then degraded selectively at maturation of the cell. Using GFP reporter gene constructs, we examine the gene's cis-elements, and through use of bioinformatic approaches, have cloned and are testing specific transcription factors found greatly enriched in oocytes for their contribution to this cell's phenotypic development."

S"The goal of the research in our laboratory is to understand how TGF-B signaling molecules facilitate the communication between cells. Cellular communication is essential to the proper manifestation of cell movements, growth, and differentiation during the development of multi-cellular organisms. Secreted proteins, such as those which belong to the transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B ) superfamily, are thought to mediate intercellular communication through their binding and/or association with integral membrane proteins. The transmission of such a signal culminates in the activation or repression of gene expression in the responding cell, resulting in alterations in the cell's phenotype, its position in the cell cycle, the types or extent of proteins expressed on the cell's surface, and/or in further transcription of new sets of genes. TGF-B -related proteins have been identified in both vertebrates and invertebrates as signaling factors which are instrumental in the control of cellular growth and differentiation, as well as in inductive events that specify cell fates. In order to understand the control of cellular growth and differentiation central to normal development, it is important to elucidate the regulation and molecular and cellular mechanisms of TGF-B signaling. Our approach to elucidating these signaling mechanisms is to exploit the genetic, molecular, and cell biological techniques of Drosophila to analyze the genes and their products, which act in TGF-B-type signaling pathways, and to investigate the function and regulation of these molecules in vivo. <br /><br />To initiate this research program and as a means toward understanding the specificity of TGF-B -related signaling molecules, we have identified a new Drosophila member of the superfamily, the 60A gene. As a first step toward understanding 60A function, we have generated mutations in the locus. The phenotype of 60A mutants coupled with its wild type expression pattern suggest that 60A is important in multiple developmental processes. We are currently analysing the role of 60A in these processes, as well as beginning to identify other components of the signaling pathway which mediates the 60A signal. It will be of particular interest to compare the action and signaling pathway of 60A with that of decapentaplegic, dpp, which is probably the TGF-B family member best understood in terms of in vivo function."

Most of my research investigates issues that stand at the intersection of sociology and public policy. I wear the hat of a demographer, so I naturally lean toward population studies and the use of censuses and surveys. I am presently involved in a wide range of research projects in a variety of geographic settings. Current research on the United States includes studies of immigrant adaptation in schooling, family and the labor force. I am also working on new methods for analyzing residential segregation that can reflect the increasing ethnic diversity of contemporary America\'s urban areas. In developing societies, I study the determinants of migration, urbanization, and their demographic and environmental consequences. In China and Vietnam, I examine the link between migration patterns and economic restructuring. Currently, I am very actively involved in field research in Ghana, where I coordinate an interdisciplinary project that brings demographers and biologists together to look at demographic change, health issues, and water quality along the coast. For the last several years I have taught Sociology 13 "American Heritage: Democracy, Inequality, and Public Policy." I also teach graduate courses in migration, sociological research methods, and other subjects. A list of publications and working papers appear elsewhere on this website.

S'I continue to develop a long-range research program in continental ecosystem evolution, especially in ancient lake systems, using a suite of sensitive isotopic and paleontological proxies to better understand the role of historical contingency, environmental cyclicity, and rare, sometime catastrophic events in earth history at a sample resolution and time scale appropriate for numerical, process-based models.<br /><br />This year I initiated research in the Late Triassic (Chinle Formation) of the southwestern U.S. to examine how changes in climate and carbon cycle dynamics are related to biotic turnover events including the rise of dinosaurs. I have already obtained exciting preliminary results suggesting an unstable carbon cycle for much of the Late Triassic (Dunlavey, Whiteside, & Irmis, GSA abstract 2009) and have identified carbon isotopic excursions occurring at the only major faunal and floral turnover event recognized in the Chinle Formation. This work formed the basis for a collaborative proposal to NSF SGP and integrates well with my investigation of similar processes with the Colorado Plateau Coring Project. <br /><br /><i>New Lab Set-up:</i> My primary focus has been to get my lab operational, including my central research tool, a ThermoElectron DeltaVPlus mass spec interfaced with GC, TC/EA and gas bench. <br /><br /><i>Field work in Green River Formation:</i> I spent five weeks in the field, three with graduate student Devina Swarup recovering samples and measuring sections from the Green River Formation of Utah and Colorado. This was a successful field expedition; we sampled in detail 30 m of outcrop section and took back with us ~200 m of &#189; round cut of the White River Shale Project, P-4 and Tosco Corp., Utah State 1 cores from the Utah Geological Survey. <br /><br /><i>Field work in Kinney Quarry:</i> With an associate from the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Sciences, I excavated the Pennsylvanian age strata of the Kinney Quarry lacustrine lagerst&#228;tte, west of Albuqueque, NM, famous for well-preserved fossils of the oldest diapsids (the group to which living lizards, crocodilians, birds, and dinosaurs belong). Along with Brown undergraduates, I am currently analyzing the samples for a suite of paleoenvironmental/ paleoclimate proxies to better understand the practically unknown environmental context. <br /><br /><i>Colorado Plateau Coring Project:</i> I am a collaborator on a major proposal to recover cores spanning 100 million years of the early Mesozoic sedimentary record of the Colorado Plateau. My component of the project is to develop a molecule-specific carbon and hydrogen chemostratigraphy that will yield a synoptic view of early Mesozoic long-term trends in CO2 &#948;13C and water balance. These cores, needed because of pervasive surface alteration, will place this rich biological and geological archive in a high-resolution global picture that will allow tests of alternative models of climate evolution during the assembly of Pangea and tests of models of the tempo and mode of biotic change during the first half of the Mesozoic.'

It argues that, over the past decade, writers have both challenged and profited from new transnational markets for their work, in a move whose literary and ideological implications are far-reaching.<br /><br />Whitfield is also editor of the critical edition of Antonio Jos&#233; Ponte\'s stories (Un arte de hacer ruinas; M&#233;xico: FCE, 2005) and co-editor with Jacqueline Loss of an anthology of Cuban short fiction in translation, _New Short Fiction from Cuba_ (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2007). She has published several articles on contemporary Latin American fiction and Welsh diasporic literature.<br /><br />Her second book project, "Remembering the Welsh of Patagonia,"  addresses recent representations of nineteenth-century Welsh emigration to Patagonia, Argentina, and the intersections of these with debates on nationalism, language rights and ethnic studies in both Wales and Argentina.  Through a range of readings in Welsh, Spanish and English, the project proposes that contemporary recuperations of this historical episode are key to  the fashioning of local, post-imperial identities.'

S'My research projects are grouped into three distinct areas.<br /><br />The first of these focuses on obtaining structural and mechanistic <br />information for reactive intermediates such as enolate anions and <br />amide bases.  Hence I have discovered and published an extensive <br />sequence of crystal structures of aggregates that are formed upon <br />mixing enolizable substrates with amide bases.  A sequence of <br />aggregated 15-20 structures depicting different possible stages of an <br />aldol reaction can be found on my web page.<br /><br />Most recently, I have begun to utilize diffusion oriented NMR (DOSY <br />or DO-NMR) to correlate the solid state crystal structure determined <br />by x-ray diffraction analyses with the corresponding solution state <br />species.  We are also developing the DOSY NMR methodology to allow us <br />to determine molecular weights of these species in solution.  This is <br />extremely exciting because it allows us to determine the solvation <br />state of the aggregates in solution directly by NMR.  This is the <br />only convenient way to obtain such information at the subambient <br />temperatures where these species are typically utilized.<br /><br />The second main area of research focuses on developing asymmetric <br />synthetic reaction methods based upon the structural and mechanistic <br />information accumulated in my group.  Most recently, we are looking at <br />several template aggregates that have cropped up with a wide range of <br />structure variation but which maintain the same general 2:1 chiral <br />co-factor to reactive nucleophile stoichiometry. Also, we have <br />recently begun to expand this project by preparing small polymeric <br />versions of these chiral templates.  Initial results of this study <br />are available.<br /><br />Finally, I have maintained an involvement in several purely drug <br />development projects with different collaborators at the affiliated <br />Brown University Hospitals, the Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center, <br />and the RI Cancer Council.  These projects involve synthesis of and <br />discovery of new drugs for cancer chemotherapy.  The currently active <br />project involves synthesis of gadolinium containing porphyrin <br />derivatives and both in vitro and in vivo screening of these as <br />neutron capture agents.'

S"Dr. Wilson is interested in how structural features of healthcare systems affect interactions between physicians and patients, and how those interactions in turn affect patients' health outcomes.  In recent years his research has increasingly focused on patients' adherence with prescription medications as an important example of these relationships.  The long-term objective of this research is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of medication adherence problems in persons with HIV and other chronic illnesses.  To accomplish this, Dr. Wilson's research focuses on physicians' communication skills, on physicians' practice environments, and on system-level factors that can support physicians and improve the quality of therapeutic drug management.  This research employs a wide variety of methods, including qualitative research, analysis of observational data, and randomized trials of interventions.<br /><br />For example, in collaboration with other researchers, Dr. Wilson has developed a new method to describe and analyze physician-patient interactions called the General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS).  One of the innovations of the GMIAS is that it is the first system to code and analyze physician-patient interactions that focuses on medication adherence.  While work to date with the GMIAS has focused on medication adherence, the system is designed to be a tool that is broadly applicable to studies of physician-patient communication during office visits.  A number of grants have used the GMIAS, including a current project that examines whether differences in physician-patient communication can contribute to explaining racial and ethnic disparities in HIV care.  <br /><br />Other currently active projects related to medication adherence include 1) a grant that will use cognitive interviewing of patients taking HIV antiretroviral medications to develop new questionnaire items that improve the accuracy of self-reports of medication adherence, 2) a randomized trial of an intensive intervention to improve HIV physicians' adherence counseling skills, and 3) a study funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to examine whether a web-based, physician-focused intervention grounded in behavioral economic theory can improve patients' medication adherence.  In conducting this research, Dr. Wilson collaborates with scientists from a wide variety of disciplines, including biostatistics, epidemiology, psychology, sociology, and economics."

S'My first book reflects my early training in stylistics, semantics, and semiotics and is entitled <i>Metaphoric Narration: The Nature and Function of Metaphors in \'A la recherche du temps perdu\'</i> (1978). It grew out of my dissertation on Proust, directed by Michael Riffaterre at Columbia University, where I received my Ph.D in 1971. Given the nature of my approach in that study, I was invited by Robert Scholes to teach several courses in what was then called the Semiotcs Program, now known as Modern Culture and Media. We team taught a course on metaphor, one on narrative, and another, with Mary Ann Doane, on narrative and film.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />While at Brown, where I arrived in 1973 after having taught for three years at Williams College, I was asked to teach several courses on the novel, using different approaches. I soon became very interested in reader-oriented theories to literary texts. To encourage an open dialogue on that subject, I organized and participated in several sessions at conferences devoted to readers and reading, notably a seminar at the 1980 Modern Language Association that I organized and co-chaired with Susan Suleiman on "The Reader in Fiction: Approached through Semiotics, Hermeneutics, and Phenomenology." The enthusiastic response to our session was overwhelming: some 500 people showed up! We obviously had hit on a hot topic and decided to co-edit a book of original essays, which was published by Princeton University Press in 1980 under the title <i>The Reader in the Text: Essays on Audience and Interpretation</i>. <br /><br />I spent my first sabbatical year (1979-80) on a Humboldt Research Fellowship at the University of Konstanz in Germany, at the invitation of one of the most prominent theorists of the aesthetics of reception, Wolfgang Iser, whom I had met the previous year while we were both on the same panel at a poetics conference at Brown. This experience definitely influenced and informed my next book, <i>Poetics of Reading: Approaches to the Novel</i> (Princeton University Press, 1988). <br /><br />Around 1990, I refocused my attention on my first research interest, Proust. By this time his work had "fallen into the public domain," which meant that new discoveries were made, including the resurfacing of hitherto unseen manuscripts, which led to more than one new edition of <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i>. To keep up with this new information and the predominant approach to the study of texts, known in France as "la g&#233;n&#233;tique," I organized three lectures, with prominent scholars in the field, on reading Proust in the new editions. These lectures enhanced the work we were doing in a graduate seminar devoted to a genetic approach to Proust\'s novel during the same semester (Fall, 1990). In turn, this work led to several invited lectures elsewhere (Princeton University, the University of Texas at Austin, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia Unviversity, Urbino, and Cerisy) and to research at the Institut des Textes et Manuscrits Modernes, at the Centre Nacional de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Paris, where for several years now I have been a member of the "Equipe Proust"--an international research team that is presently engaged in transcribing the Proust notebooks for publication.<br /><br />A few years later, given our joint interest in editing texts, Julio Ortega and I organized "The Status of the Text: A Franco-Hispanic Workshop on Editing Manuscripts," sponsored by our two departments and the Centre Nacional de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), March 1997.<br /><br />Besides these new ventures into genetic criticism, I have, in the past ten years, taken a great interest in the study of emotions, which has informed my scholarship and teaching. I pay attention to both the representation of literary emotions and the reader\'s affective response. I approach the study of emotions from an interdisciplinary perspective, including psychological and philosophical theories as well as aesthetic and ethical concerns. <br /><br />My work on emotions led to a symposium I organized at Brown in 1995 ("Reading Emotions") and to courses and graduate seminars focused on the French novel from the 17th to the 20th centuries, on Proust, and on novels from different cultures (including French, German, and English novels). I also participated for a semester, thanks to a faculty research fellowship, in a seminar at the Pembroke Center on "The Question of Emotion" (Spring, 2001). All this eventually led to a rethinking of my approach to Proust and informed my next book, <i>Proust and Emotion: The Importance of Affect in \'A la recherche du temps perdu\'</i> (Toronto, 2003). Concurrently, I co-edited a book, with Elyane Dezon-Jones, for the Modern Language Association series on <i>Approaches to literature, entitled Approaches to Teaching Proust\'s Fiction and Criticism</i> (2003). <br /><br />I am presently working on Proustian ethics as conveyed in <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i>, paying particular attention to what I call the "maternal paradigm"--an affect based system of caring that structures the personal relationships of the novel\'s central characters, one that the narrator extends to the reader as well in a solicitous dialogue that reaches beyond the borders of the text.<br /><br />My long-standing interest in autobiographical fiction (a favorite seminar topic in my teaching in the 1970\'s and 80\'s) will, I hope, stand me in good stead when I try my hand at this genre in the coming years, as I endeavour to come to terms with what it means to have lived in three cultures (German, French, and American). After all, I came to the United States from Germany to study and teach French.'

S"Rena Wing's research focuses on behavioral treatment of obesity and addresses the following questions:<br /><br />1.&#9;What are the health benefits of modest weight loss?<br /><br />She was responsible for developing and implementing the lifestyle intervention that was used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).  DPP was a randomized, controlled trial testing whether lifestyle intervention or metformin (a diabetes medication) could delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.  More than 3,000 overweight patients with impaired glucose tolerance, recruited at 27 centers nationwide, participated and were randomly assigned to placebo, metformin, or intensive lifestyle intervention.  The DPP showed that modest weight losses (14 pounds on average) reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 58% compared to placebo, whereas metformin reduced risk by only 31%.  This study is the most compelling evidence to date of the health benefits of weight loss.<br /><br />Currently, Dr. Wing is examining whether weight loss improves urinary incontinence in over 330 overweight women with this disorder.<br /><br />Most importantly, she is currently chair of Look AHEAD, an ongoing study funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) testing whether weight loss reduces cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in over 5,000 overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes.  Participants are recruited from 16 centers across the United States with a center at the Miriam Hospital.  Although weight loss is known to have positive short-term (1 year) effects on diabetes, this study is the first to examine the long-term (12 years) health impact.<br /><br />2.&#9;How can we improve behavioral treatment of obesity?<br /><br />Rena Wing has been studying ways to improve behavioral approaches to obesity for many years.  She had approached this topic by conducting randomized clinical trials comparing different strategies that might be included in behavioral programs.  She has shown, for example, that higher exercise goals and structured approaches to diet can improve weight loss outcomes.  She has conducted studies evaluating the role of involving overweight spouses, using financial incentives, encouraging taking breaks from dieting, and creating intra-group and inter-group competitions.  Current studies are investigating the effects of reducing variety in the diet and examining the effect of modifying the home environment.<br /><br />Recently, this research has expanded to include studies to increase the dissemination of behavioral techniques by using the internet.  Randomized trials have evaluated various approaches using human e-mail counseling or automated counseling.  <br /><br />3.&#9;Is it possible to prevent weight gain and subsequent obesity?<br /><br />A third focus has been on key time periods where prevention of weight gain might be most effective.  These periods have included childhood, the period surrounding pregnancy, and the menopausal transition.  Working with Leonard Epstein, Rena Wing did a number of clinical trials of behavioral treatments for obese children aged 8-12 and their overweight parent(s).  Current approaches target younger children (ages 4-8) and adolescents.<br /><br />Rena Wing participated in a single center clinical trial of weight loss during menopause and showed that the lifestyle intervention successfully reduced weight gain and the increases in LDL-cholesterol that are typically seen in middle-aged women.<br /><br />4.&#9;What are the characteristics of successful weight loss maintainers?<br /><br />A key issue in the treatment of obesity is the maintenance of weight loss.  Her research incorporates several different approaches to this problem.  First, she is a founder of the National Weight Control Registry, a registry of over 5,000 people who have lost over 30 pounds (mean = 70 pounds) and kept it off at least one year (mean = 5.7 years).  Self-reported data from these successful weight losers has been used to provide information about the behaviors associated with long-term maintenance of weight loss.<br /><br />In addition, she has shown that it is possible to teach the strategies of successful weight losers to others and thereby improve their maintenance of weight loss.  In a project called STOP Regain, she has found that a self-regulation intervention delivered via internet or face-to-face can reduce the risk of weight regain.<br /><br />A current study by Rena Wing compares successful weight losers with normal weight controls and obese controls on both behavioral measures and brain responses to food cues.  The question being addressed is whether successful weight losers who have reduced to normal weight now respond to food cues as always-normal weight controls, or whether they continue to respond as if obese."

S"The perspective that patterns of local (m - km spatial scale) community structure are created by an interplay of local and regional (> 100 km) processes has been overlooked until recently. I believe that one can't understand how local communities tick without studying the influence of larger scale regional processes as well as local processes.  Consequently, my overarching research goal is to integrate traditional community ecological, oceanographic, and new macroecological approaches to understand the structure and functioning of local marine communities. I have spent a substantial portion of my research life at sea conducting field work at many local sites in order to develop this broader perspective for marine subtidal communities. Our lab is particularly  interested in framing our research questions so that they are relevant to conservation needs.  More details on the predominant themes of my research program are presented below. <br /><br />Regulation of food webs: A key question in ecology is what controls food web dynamics. I have focused primarily on the themes of bottom-up regulation by oceanographic processes and top-down predatory control, but have also investigated human impacts. My current food web research is examining the role of upwelling as an agent of bottom up - top down control of subtidal food webs in the Gal&#225;pagos Marine Reserve (GMR), and human impacts on cod - dominated trophic cascades in the Gulf of Maine (GOM). In the GMR, this research is testing the general hypothesis that upwelling sites have high rates of algal and sessile invertebrate prey production, attracting consumers, and creating bottom-up and top-down linkages. We hypothesize that diversity at upwelling sites is enhanced by high predation on competitive dominants and by a diverse larval supply.  Barnacles are the focal prey species since they are abundant throughout the Gal&#225;pagos subtidal; they consume upwelling production and are heavily predated by whelks, fish and sea urchins. Consistent patterns of high barnacle recruitment and predation at 5 upwelling sites  were revealed by working at 12 sites across a 120 km region of the GMR.  In the GOM, we are revisiting offshore sites where cod dominated the food web in the late 1980's to test the hypothesis that overfishing of cod since then has changed top-down control of cod prey (crabs, etc.).<br /><br />Coupling of physical and biological processes. A few decades ago the prevailing idea was that the subtidal zone was physically benign, characterized by low environmental variability.  To the contrary, our lab has documented high environmental stress in the subtidal zone caused by large hydrodynamic forces, wide fluctuations of temperature,  salinity, and hypoxia. We continue to test predictions of environmental stress models for these systems.  The rocky subtidal zone is greatly influenced by pelagic events as we found for internal waves driving a pulsed food supply regime to the sea floor across large spatial scales in the GOM. Internal wave driven coupling appears to be an important engine of productivity for topographically high areas of the sea floor in general. Current research goals in the area of benthic pelagic coupling are to develop a general model of upwelling effects for subtidal communities and to test the hypothesis that upwelling confers higher resilience to communities, warranting conservation.<br /><br />Biodiversity.  I am interested in the origin and maintenance of biological diversity. A large part of my research has focused on the question of whether the numbers of species in local communities are primarily due to local processes such as competition, predation, disturbance, etc., or simply reflect a sink from the regional source pool of species that has assembled over evolutionary time due to processes of speciation, immigration, and extinction.  By directly sampling the  local species richness of epifaunal invertebrate communities in subtidal rock wall habitats on a global scale, we  found that the richness of the regional species pool could explain 73 - 76 % of local richness. We are using our global data base of > 1500 diversity quadrats for further macroecological analyses of marine diversity patterns, specifically:  1) the relation between productivity, biodiversity, and body size from local-global spatial scales, 2) latitudinal variation in beta diversity and species rarity, 3) dispersal mode and the local regional diversity relationship, and 4) testing the neutral model of species diversity. One of the initial findings was that the proportion of regional biota represented in local communities increased from the tropics toward high latitude communities. Consequently, we are increasing the sampling of high latitude communities to test hypotheses explaining this effect, and are sampling the diversity of subtidal communities on the Alaskan peninsula in the summer of 2006. Since this work underscores the importance of source pools for local species richness, my students and I are investigating aspects of supply-sided ecology, but from a diversity rather than from a population standpoint.   Despite the fact that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is critical for the conservation of biodiversity, little is known about this relation in marine communities. We have started to investigate how the biodiversity of grazers (urchins, fish) influences one measure of ecosystem function, productivity, in the Gal&#225;pagos Marine Reserve."

S"Growing up near the broad horizon of the ocean undoubtedly influenced my interest in large-scale marine ecology. I was trained in marine benthic ecology as a high school student at Sandy Hook Marine Lab, NJ. Studying the impacts of sewage and dredge spoil dumping on offshore marine life impressed upon me the need to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the ocean. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to conduct a year long independent study of animal-sediment relations in a New Zealand estuary. This experience taught me how to do science and it helped develop my world view of ecology and sense of belonging to a global human community.  I spent another year and a half in the South Pacific, working my way through the Fiji and New Hebrides Islands to see pristine coral reefs before they were altered by human disturbance. I began to learn the spectacularly diverse marine invertebrate fauna of the western Pacific during this time, which helped enormously when I began a global biodiversity study nearly two decades later. I re-entered the academic community at the University of New Hampshire. Excited about the opportunities in marine community ecology, I went straight through for a PhD with Larry Harris. A post-doc at Northeastern University's Marine Science Center with Ken Sebens led to my first faculty position. I helped develop the East West Marine Biology Program there and enjoyed teaching marine benthic ecology in Nahant and coral reef ecology in Jamaica.  I am deeply committed to training the next generation of ecologists and to developing the best marine conservation science.  I moved to Brown University in 1994. I have been fortunate to conduct research in six out of seven oceans of the world."

S'My research is on the assessment and perception of personality and individual differences in childhood. Current research focuses on developmental psychopathology, especially aggression, withdrawal, and anti-social behavior in middle childhood. In contrast to widely used diagnostic and syndromal approaches that emphasize the overall frequency of children\'s behavior problems, our contextualist framework examines the social environments children encounter in their interactions with adults and peers, how these environments influence children\'s reactions, and how children\'s reactions reciprocally influence their immediate social ecology. <br /><br />Field studies use extensive observations of children\'s social interactions clarify how children change in response<br /><br />with topographically-similar overall behavior rates nevertheless differ both in their immediate social ecologies and how they respond to the interpersonal stimuli they encounter. Laboratory experiments, using computer-simulated analogue children, examine how children and adults encode and interpret target\'s social environments and the cross-situational patterning of their responses to specific social situations. Related research examines the discrepancies between standardized assessment methods, which de-emphasize contextual influences, and personality impressions by laypeople and clinicians, which often appear to be more sensitive to the cross-situational organization of behavior. <br /><br />Our field research takes advantage of a collaboration, now spanning two decades, with a summer residential treatment program for at-risk youth in New Hampshire. Each summer, approximately 150 children with emotional and behavior programs are enrolled in the 45-day program, served by a staff of more than 100 counselors and teachers. Daily classroom instruction focuses on academic mastery and a structured activity schedule fosters age-appropriate interests and social interaction. Individualized treatment plans identify each child\'s problem behaviors, defined behavioral goals, and set forth cognitive-behavioral interventions to promote affective self-regulation and adaptive social functioning. The setting has provided unique opportunities for extensive behavioral observations throughout each day of the session and in a wide range of social and academic settings, allowing in-depth, fine-grained analyses of the social interactional processes that contribute to children\'s problem and prosocial behaviors. <br /><br />Supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, a three-year project beginning in the summer of 2006 will obtain detailed assessments from parents and teachers of the children before they enter the program, fine-grained observations of the children\'s social interactions during the residential session, and multiple follow-up assessments after children return to home and school in the fall. Building on previous studies on the contextual patterning of behavior, this research will develop a contextualist framework for studying behavior change and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Rather than operationalizing change in terms of overall reductions in symptom frequency, change is operationalized in terms of the distinct social interactional processes that contribute to symptom reduction, including changes in the social environment, changes in the patterning of children\'s reactions to their environments, or both. In this way the research aims to clarify why treatment effects often fail to generalize from the intervention setting to other settings, why some children show "worsening" or "deviancy training" during interventions, and how outcome research can benefit from incorporating process-oriented, context-sensitive measures of the changes children undergo during treatment.'

S"VA Health Services Research: IIR 04-313<br /><br />Variability in Surgical Blood Transfusion Practices and Cardiovascular Outcome<br /><br />Funding Period: July 2005 - June 2007 <br /><br />BACKGROUND / RATIONALE: Anemia is common in the elderly undergoing surgery and has been associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. Despite the awareness of blood transfusion guidelines, variable transfusion practices still prevail among different practitioners and institutions.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE(S): Using a merge of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, the Outpatient Care (OPC) Files, the VA-Medicare dataset and the Patient Treatment Files (PTF), this research is designed to answer two questions: 1) Does blood transfusion during surgery adjusted for hematocrit values, patient comorbidities, types of operation, provider and hospital factors predict 30-day perioperative cardiac or neurologic events in elderly veterans undergoing non-cardiac surgery? 2) Do hospital's blood transfusion guideline adherence rates for elderly veterans during non-cardiac surgery adjusted for medical comorbidites, types of operations, and institutional characteristics predict the hospital's 30-day perioperative cardiac or neurologic event rates of the operated elderly with anemia?<br /><br />METHODS: This is a cohort study using the clinical and administrative information from the NSQIP database merged with prior cardiac care data obtained from the PTF, OPC and VA-Medicare datasets. We will include all veteran patients age >65 years in the NSQIP data who underwent major non-cardiac surgery in 127 VA hospitals nationwide during 1991-2003. The primary outcome will be 30-day perioperative cardiac or neurologic events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, or coma). We expect a sample of 330,000 patients and analyses will be performed at patient and hospital levels. At the patient level, we will relate anemia to outcomes and use hierarchical regression modeling to conduct a propensity analysis of receiving operative blood transfusions. The hierarchical model is based on the assumption of three levels of nested effects on the decision to transfuse blood: patient factors nested within provider factors, which in turn is nested within institutional factors. Patients will be stratified by their preoperative hematocrit and then distributed in quintiles according to their likelihood of receiving blood transfusions (based on propensity scores), and outcomes of the transfused versus non-transfused cohorts compared. At the hospital level, institutions will be distributed according to their degree of adherence to blood transfusion guidelines, adjusted for the propensity score to receive operative blood transfusions, and compared on the periopeartive event rates of the elderly with anemia.<br /><br />FINDINGS / RESULTS: No results at this time.<br /><br />IMPACT: We anticipate this project to improve the outcome of patients undergoing surgery by the identification of high risk groups that would benefit most from blood transfusion therapy, and to decrease the incidence of unnecessary blood transfusions. We will also provide a scientific rationale to the adherence to blood transfusion guidelines and expect to reduce the variability in operative blood transfusion practices.<br /><br />PUBLICATIONS:<br />None at this time. <br /><br />DRA: Aging and Age-Related Changes, Chronic Diseases, Health Services and Systems <br /><br />DRE: Treatment, Epidemiology <br />Keywords: Cardiovascular disease, Quality assessment, Surgery"

S"Xu Wenli is an Institute senior fellow through June 30, 2008. One of China's most recognized pro-democracy advocates, Mr. Xu spent 16 years in prison for his activities as a dissident. He was a leader in the Democracy Wall movement from 1979 to 1981, edited the samizdat-style journal April Fifth Forum, and played a major role in establishing the Beijing-Tianjin branch of the China Democracy Party. Mr. Xu's health suffered while in prison. In reaction to his declining condition, international human rights groups, the U.S. ambassador to China, and Western officials called for his release. The Chinese government finally relented and released him on medical grounds in December 2002. He and his wife left China immediately for the United States to be reunited with their daughter, Xu Jin, who lives in Rhode Island."

S'My manuscript Performing Conquest: Theatre, History and Identity in Tlaxcala, Mexico 1538-2004, examines theatrical and political performances in Tlaxcala, Mexico, to answer two seminal questions. First, how have "stagings" of the Spanish Conquest and subsequent colonization in state-sponsored pageants, theater productions, and political events been used to manipulate concepts of indigenous, local, and national identity so as to support competing political or socio-cultural agendas? Second, how do these events reveal how and why performance has emerged as a primary mode of political speech in contemporary Mexico, and to what end? I answer these questions by analyzing how the creators of these events used historical and cultural information to articulate a distinctively Tlaxcalan identity and how they manipulated performance practices popular from the Spanish Conquest forward to stake their claims.<br /><br />For most Mexicans, Tlaxcala\'s history centers on its indigenous residents\' 1519 choice to fight with the Spanish against their traditional enemies, the Aztecs. Disease and financial hardships caused the area\'s fortunes to decline by the seventeenth century despite their receipt of special privileges from the Spanish Crown. Tlaxcala\'s economic disenfranchisement continues today. It is the nation\'s smallest and least productive state, and is politically marginalized within the nation. Tlaxcala is also historiographically maligned; when Mexican independence movements that employed the Aztecs as their symbol of solidarity commenced in the nineteenth century, the Tlaxcaltecans were written into political treatises, literature, and historical narratives as traitors to the emergent nation, creating a frought relationship between regional and national historiography that continues today. Nonetheless, its mostly mestizo (of mixed European and indigenous descent) residents continue to negotiate their place in the Mexican cultural sphere by staging the Tlaxcalan past in order to attain their various political, social, and personal aims. The combination of Tlaxcala\'s unique history, difficult relationship with both New Spanish and Mexican governments, and its rich tradition of theatrical representation make it an ideal site to consider how underrepresented communities within Mexico came to use artistic production as a mode of political speech. <br /><br />Because I am interested in the presentational nature of politics as well as political performances, I include plays, festivals, state-sponsored pageants, and "staged" political acts as objects of study. My archival sources include published and unpublished play texts, reviews, municipal records of processions and political acts, civic maps, production photos, soundtracks, and video archives. I also use interviews, performance and rehearsal viewing, and participant observation to determine how artists articulated and audiences understood these events and their production processes as modes of identity construction and/or political speech.'

S'Shirley Yen is currently supported by a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K-23) application to further her development as an independent research scientist with a programmatic line of research that examines the phenomenology of suicidal behaviors. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) represents a significant risk factor for repeat suicide attempts and suicide deaths, yet there has been no prospective study of BPD among adolescent suicide attempters. Her research seeks to examine the associations between affective traits consistent with BPD, family functioning, and adolescent suicidality. <br /><br />Shirley Yen\'s study examinse a model, heavily influenced by Linehan\'s biosocial theory of BPD and by prominent developmental theories, in which the combination of individual dispositional factors (affective processing consistent with BPD) and environmental factors (invalidating family environment) is hypothesized to predict adolescent suicidal behavior (ideation and attempts). A naturalistic, descriptive, six-month follow-up study of 120 adolescents who had been hospitalized for suicidal behavior was be implemented to examine this model. Weekly or monthly ratings on key predictor and outcome variables was obtained over the six-month interval to allow for time-varying analyses. This study addresses a significant gap in knowledge, as it would be the first prospective study to examine BPD traits as well as the first study to examine key predictor variables dynamically, in suicidal adolescents. <br /><br />Dr. Yen is also the co-principal investigator of a treatment development grant for suicidal adolescents. The intervention, "Coping Long Term with Attempted Suicide Program for Adolescents" modeled on Dr. Ivan Miller\'s (co-PI) program for adults, is an adjunctive intervention that begins when adolescents are admitted to the inpatient hospital unit and continues for six months post-discharge, thus covering a period of high risk for subsequent attempts. The treatment is based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles and combines in-person sessions with phone check-ins, and has an individual as well as family component. This study is funded by the NIMH and is in progress.<br /><br />Dr. Yen is also an investigator of the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study. COBY is a multi-site naturalistic prospective study of children and adolescents with bipolar illness. Sites include Brown University (PI: M. Keller), University of Pittsburgh (PI: B. Birmaher), and UCLA (PI: M. Strober). COBY is currently in its 10th year of data collection and has generated numerous significant findings pertaining to the course and outcome of Bipolar I, II, and NOS that have been published in top tier journals. In the next phase of COBY we will be examining biomarkers to assess metabolic functioning as well as comorbidity with borderline personality disorder.'

S'Positron emission tomography (PET) utilizes positron-emitting radioactive tracer elements to produce images of physiologic function at a molecular level. The most commonly used radiopharmaceutical in PET is 18-F Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). Many cancer cells are hypermetabolic and use glucose as a fuel. 18-F FDG is a glucose analog, which allows the detection of many cancers. PET is being used increasingly in oncology to diagnose, stage, and restage cancers after therapy. Rhode Island Hospital is participating in a national study using PET to predict long-term survival in patients with locally advanced lung cancer who undergo combined chemoradiotherapy. Rhode Island Hospital is a leading center for radiofrequency ablation of many tumors, and PET is often being used to evaluate the response of tumors to radiofrequency ablation. PET/CT is now available at Rhode Island Hospital. PET/CT combines physiologic and anatomic information in one study by fusing or overlaying the PET images and CT images together. PET/CT opens up new avenues for research at Rhode Island Hospital.'

S'While studying pyramidal neurons differentiation and cortical development, I fortuitously showed that ectopic dendrite growth in metabolic brain disorders was accompanied by intra-neuronal cholesterol and ganglioside accumulation.  I subsequently designed a therapeutic approach that ameliorated neuropathology in animal models of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C.  This led to an ongoing clinical trial and sparked my interest in brain development and disease. <br /><br />My lab uses Genetic Inducible Fate Mapping (GIFM) to spatially and temporally mark small cohorts of cells and their progeny based on the expression of specific genes during embryogenesis. We then track these marked lineages to determine their behavior and contribution to brain regions and specific classes of neurons during brain development. <br /><br />We have used this method to reveal how Wnt1-expressing progenitors contribute to midbrain dopamine neurons and at later stages to the cerebellum. We have also elucidated how Gbx2 expressing progenitors contribute to the cerebellum and to adult spinal cord. We have also shown that Wnt1 is required for the proper development of subpopulations of dopamine neurons.  <br /><br />We have applied GIFM in combination with conditional gene inactivation to study the role of Tsc1 in thalamic neuron development and in establishing functional thalamocortical circuits.

S'Research Theme: DNA repair and stress responses to DNA damage <br /><br />DNA is the principal target of the vast majority of human carcinogens. These genotoxic chemicals initiate the carcinogenic process by causing DNA damage that subsequently generates mutations through erroneous replication. DNA is also the main target of several classes of chemotherapeutic drugs that exploit the vulnerability of cancer cells to certain forms of DNA damage. It has recently become evident that the amount of the initial DNA damage is not always predictive of the biological consequences, such as cancer risk among exposed individuals or efficacy of chemotherapy. There are numerous cases when cancer cells acquire resistance to drugs without any decrease in the amount of drug-induced DNA damage. <br /><br />Our main research efforts are directed at the characterization of biochemical and genetic causes of resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death and mutagenesis. We are focused on: <br />(1) DNA damage surveillance mechanisms and their linkage to DNA repair, cellular signaling networks and cell cycle checkpoints. We are particularly interested in the role of mismatch repair proteins as sensors of DNA damage causing activation of stress responses. <br />(2) Mechanisms of cell death triggered by DNA-targeting anticancer drugs. One of our areas of interests is the determination of the differences in cell death programs between normal and cancer cells and exploitation of these differences in the optimization of anticancer therapy.<br /><br />We are interested in two classes of DNA-reactive compounds: <br />(1) Metal complexes containing chromium (Cr) or platinum (Pt). Hexavalent Cr is a major environmental and occupational carcinogen with widespread human exposure due to its large-scale use in metal alloys and inorganic paints. Pt-based compounds, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, are the most commonly used class of drugs in cancer chemotherapy. <br /><br />(2) Agents that cause covalent DNA-protein crosslinks. DNA protein crosslinking can be caused by endogenous and exogenous aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and others), as well as bifunctional anticancer drugs. The biological role of DNA-protein crosslinks is poorly understood relative to smaller forms of DNA damage but these very bulky lesions can act as highly potent inducers of large chromosomal rearrangements and cellular senescence (permanent growth arrest).  Induction of a senescent state in cancer cells will terminate tumor growth whereas age-associated accumulation of senescence-promoting DNA-protein crosslinks can contribute to tissue aging and age-associated increases in cancer incidence.'

S'Mind/Body Interaction and Health Research<br /><br />Over the last 25 years, my research has integrated reproductive and social epidemiology, developmental psychology, and epidemiologic methods with community-based public health practice.  Major measurement development work includes research on life course exposure measurements of interpersonal and structural violence exposure, including neighborhood safety, police-related homicide of young Black men, economic composition and racial disparities in homicide victimization, and multiple studies of geospatial socioeconomic small-area interactions with respect to violence, depression, and HIV infection (Zierler, AJPH 2000; Pearlman PubPolRpt, 2003; Gjelsvik et al; J Urban Hlth 2004); development of measures of life course violence victimization (Wise et al, Zierler,  The Lancet 1991;), and dimensions of spirituality and health effects (Zierler and Stein, Fetzer presentation, Chicago 2003).<br /><br />"Compassionate love as a mediator of stress responses among HIV infected people (18+ years) and their families" (PI; Fetzer Institute; 2001-2004):  Phase I of this project is measurement of spiritual dimensions using previously validated questions supplemented with qualitative interviews on spirituality, religiosity, love, and social responsibility. Our hypothesis is that compassionate love promotes physical well-being both proactively and reactively through spiritual interactions with physiologic regulation of stress.  Preliminary data suggest that people with HIV infection who report selfless caring for others at least everyday had more than a three-fold increase in odds of CD4> 350 relative to people reporting compassionate loving less often. As well, risk of depression was over 7 times greater among people reporting less than daily compassionate love.<br /><br />"Societal factors, stress hormones, and preterm birth", Co-investigator, Subcontract from HPHC, March of Dimes 20-FY03-0699 (Rich-Edwards, PI): The aims of this study are to test the extent to which: 1) maternal experiences of racism or violence in childhood and adulthood are associated with the risk of preterm birth; 2) second trimester levels of CRH are associated with risk of preterm birth; and 3) Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels are associated with maternal experiences of racism or violence. Enduring social and psychological stress may raise the risk of preterm delivery by raising levels of placental CRH. Women who have been the targets of racism or personal violence may be at particularly high risk of preterm delivery. Dr. Rich-Edwards and her team have begun to examine these questions among women enrolled in Project Viva, a Boston-based longitudinal study of 6,000 pregnant women and their children. My role has been development and analysis of measures of violence and threats of violence over the life course of pregnant women in relation to maternal, cord blood, and newborn CRH levels.<br /><br />"Life course of violence victimization and ovarian aging" (S Zierler, PI, NIH-NIMH 1R01 MH 57735, 9/1/1998-5/31/2001): The goals of this project were to investigate physiologic effects of sexual and physical violence as cumulative stressors on occurrence of menstrual disorders and rate of decline in ovarian aging, as measured by serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2), which respectively rise and fall with onset of menopause. Overall, women who experienced abuse during childhood or adolescence relative to never abused women had a slight positive association with high FSH. However, a positive association with high FSH was not observed among women whose first abuse occurred during adulthood. We also reported early perimenopause to be associated with social and economic deprivation in childhood (ref.), and in another article, that early abuse was associated with greater risk of adult depression (Wise et al). Three articles on long-term effects of violence and social class on depression risk and perimenopausal onset have been published. Longitudinal data analysis did not support the baseline findings of early onset of perimenopause except among depressed women. Our studies have contributed to measurement discussions (laboratory levels and self-reports) and hypotheses regarding embodiment of early violence victimization as a cause of premature ovarian aging.<br /><br />Other research on social inequalities in health include studies of protection laws of discrimination against sexual minorities and teenage suicide;  neighborhood housing and environmental conditions and asthma risk; neighborhood, race/ethnicity, and overweight/obese prevalence; and pre-natal HIV testing in relation to race/ethnicity.'

S'Research in our laboratory is in the area of molecular and cellular neurobiology, with an emphasis on the function, structure, and regulation of ion channels, and the mechanisms of visual transduction. Essentially every function in the body is controlled by the activity of ion channels&#151;membrane proteins that change their conformation in response to chemical and electrical signals, allowing specific ions to enter or exit cells as needed. Ion channels are critically involved in functions as diverse as nerve impulses in the brain, the beating of the heart, visual perception, muscle contraction, learning and memory, and embryonic development. They are also the targets of many drugs, such as those used to treat pain and heart disease, and genetic defects in ion channels can cause devastating diseases, such as cystic fibrosis.<br /><br />Our current work centers on ion channels that are opened by direct interaction with cyclic nucleotides (e.g., cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP) and by changes in membrane voltage. Since these ion channels contain pores that allow the passage of Ca2+ and Na+ into cells, their activity affects membrane voltage and the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, both of which are vital regulators of cell function. These "cyclic nucleotide-gated" ion channels are intimately involved in the first stages of vision, and mutations in these channels cause some forms of blindness (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa).<br /><br />We study the molecular mechanisms by which these ion channels undergo conformational changes, how they are affected by mutations, and how they are regulated by intracellular factors, such as calcium binding proteins and phosphorylation enzymes, and by external agents such as local anesthetics. Some of our current research centers on the control of ion channel function by the lipid bilayer, by lipophilic modulators and by protein-protein interactions. Our experimental techniques include electrophysiology (mainly patch clamp methods), molecular biology (including site-directed mutagenesis), biochemistry and mathematical/computer modeling. For most projects, we study cloned ion channels heterogously expressed in Xenopus (frog) oocytes, but we also use photoreceptors (rod and cone cells) to study the role of channel modulation in vision.'

These protein molecules change shape in response to signals between cells or within cells. In one shape, a pore opens that allows ions like calcium and sodium to enter or leave cells, producing vital electrical and chemical signals. Ion channels are the targets of some drugs, such as those used to treat pain and heart disease, and their defects cause diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. Her lab uses molecular biology and electrophysiology methods to study channels cloned from the brain, retina and heart. These channels are opened by the binding of molecules called cyclic nucleotides. She studies the molecular mechanism of channel opening, as well as how other factors affect this process. Understanding how ion channels are regulated can help in the design of drugs or gene therapy protocols to treat many diseases.<br /><br />She has always had a very strong interest in physics and math as they apply to biology and chemistry. This is a good way to combine them. Also, she is interested in how cells in the nervous system communicate with each other and with the outside world.

S'The Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project is an ongoing clinical research project that began more than a decade ago.  To date, approximately 2,500 patients presenting for treatment at the Rhode Island Hospital Department of Psychiatry outpatient practice have been evaluated with semi-structured diagnostic interviews making this the largest clinical epidemiological study ever conducted.  In 2003 we published a book chapter describing the background and methods the MIDAS project and summarizing the results published in several journal articles. To date more than 100 articles have been published based on the MIDAS project dataset. Below is the book chapter that summarizes much of this work.<br /><br />DSM-III was published in 1980 (American Psychiatric Association 1980). The principal goal of changing the way psychiatric disorders were defined from DSM-II\'s prototypic descriptions of disorders to the Washington University diagnostic approach of specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria (Feighner, Robins, Guze et al. 1972) was to improve diagnostic reliability.  The early reviews of DSM-III suggested that it succeeded in "solving" the reliability problem (Klerman, Vailant, Spitzer et al. 1984), and up until recently few questions had been raised about the adequacy of diagnostic practice in clinical settings in the post-DSM-III era.  However, during the past few years, several studies have raised concerns about the thoroughness and accuracy of diagnostic evaluations conducted by mental health professionals in routine clinical practice (Basco, Bostic, Davies et al. 2000; Shear, Greeno, Kang et al. 2000; Zimmerman and Mattia 1999d).<br /><br />Back in 1980, when DSM-III was published, I was a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Iowa.  During this time I began working in the Department of Psychiatry, which was then chaired by George Winokur (one of the co-authors of the Washington University criteria), and worked as a researcher in the Department for six years.  Working with Bill Coryell on one of the two inpatient units of Psychopathic Hospital I was trained in the administration of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS, Endicott and Spitzer 1978) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD, Hamilton 1960).  Working with Bruce Pfohl, I helped develop the first semi-structured interview to assess the DSM-III personality disorders&#151;the Structured Interview for DSM-III Personality (SIDP, Stangl, Pfohl, Zimmerman et al. 1985).  The three of us, along with Dalene Stangl, conducted a large psychobiological study of depression which included research interviews for depressive symptoms, personality disorders, family history of psychiatric disorders, life events, social support, and follow-up status (Pfohl, Stangl, and Zimmerman 1984; Zimmerman, Coryell, Pfohl et al. 1986; Zimmerman, Pfohl, Coryell et al. 1991).  In another study conducted during my tenure at Iowa I administered the full SADS to a series of nonmanic psychotic patients, conducted six and twelve-month follow-up interviews of these patients with a standardized instrument, and coordinated a family study of psychiatric disorders in which first-degree family members of patients and controls were administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) and the SIDP (Coryell and Zimmerman 1987; Zimmerman and Coryell 1990). Thus, my initial experience in evaluating psychiatric patients, which lasted for six years, consisted almost entirely of the administration of comprehensive, standardized research interviews.<br /><br />The structure and content of these interviews were imprinted, and when I began my clinical career I found that I was essentially administering the instruments.  Consequently, my initial intake appointments typically lasted at least two hours whereas my colleagues completed theirs in less than an hour.  When I examined my colleagues\' charts I noticed that they were unlikely to diagnose patients with more than one psychiatric disorder.  This was clearly in contrast to the high comorbidity rates found in studies of patients based on research instruments, and lower than the rates I found in my patients.  It was this observation, in the context of my research background, that was the impetus for initiating the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project in which research assessment methods have been incorporated into routine clinical practice.<br /><br />The MIDAS project consists of two major components&#151;a structured initial diagnostic evaluation and standardized follow-up outcome ratings. An expanded version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, described below) has thus far been administered to more than 1,800 psychiatric outpatients presenting for treatment.  The study is ongoing; consequently, the sample size in our more recent publications is larger than initial papers.  After the study was underway and running smoothly, the full SIDP for DSM-IV was introduced and more than 1,000 patients have been evaluated on DSM-IV Axis II.  From the outset we assumed that comprehensive structured interviews were unlikely to be incorporated into many other clinical practices; thus, we developed a self-administered questionnaire to screen for the most common DSM-IV Axis I disorders diagnosed in outpatient settings (Zimmerman and Mattia 1999f; Zimmerman and Mattia 2001a; Zimmerman and Mattia 2001b).  The goal was to develop a measure with good psychometric properties that could be incorporated into routine clinical practice.<br /><br />Adequate outcome evaluation requires attention to comorbidity; a wealth of data indicates that comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception.  An outcome instrument should also monitor psychosocial functioning and quality of life.  Structured research interviews, either on a regular basis or simply as pretreatment and post-treatment endpoint assessments, are too time consuming and thus expensive for use in routine outpatient mental health settings.  A major obstacle towards implementing a comprehensive outcome program in routine clinical practice is the lack of a single, user-friendly instrument that assesses each of these important domains of treatment outcome.  Consequently, as part of the MIDAS project we developed a DSM-IV based self-report questionnaire and clinician-rating system that can provide information to clinicians and clinics in a cost-effective manner.<br /><br />To date the focus of the publications from the MIDAS project has been on the initial assessment.  Consequently, in this chapter I focus on this aspect of our research-clinical practice integration.  Readers interested in how we integrated the outcome ratings into our practice, and how this enabled us to examine such clinically important questions as the relative efficacy of switching or augmenting antidepressants in treatment refractory depressed patients, are referred to these publications (Posternak and Zimmerman 2001; Posternak, Zimmerman, and Solomon 2002).<br /><br />Methods of the MIDAS Project<br /><br />Patients who call our practice are offered the option of receiving a standard clinical evaluation or a more comprehensive diagnostic interview.  Patients are told that the comprehensive diagnostic interview lasts half a day.  Patients are asked to arrive at 8:00 a.m., are given two questionnaires to complete, and then are interviewed with the SCID, the SIDP-IV, and the FH-RDC. A trained diagnostic rater, currently a Ph.D. level clinical psychologist, conducts the interviews. The patient is usually scheduled to be seen by the treating psychiatrist in the afternoon of the same day.  After completing the standardized interviews, while waiting to see the psychiatrist, patients are asked to complete additional self-report scales.  Sometimes, the interview with the psychiatrist is scheduled for another day, and patients are asked to bring the completed questionnaires at this time.  For all evaluations, the diagnostic rater meets with the psychiatrist to summarize the findings from the structured interviews before the psychiatrist meets with the patient.<br /><br />When this methodology was first proposed my colleagues did not believe that this protocol could be successfully implemented in a clinical practice because it would interfere with the development of a therapeutic relationship with patients.  Because the patient spent more time with the diagnostic rater than the treating psychiatrist it was suggested that it would be more difficult to develop a therapeutic alliance.  To avoid jeopardizing the clinical practices of my colleagues, the first patients enrolled in the MIDAS project were limited to those who were scheduled to see me.  When seeing patients for the intake evaluation I began my clinical interview by summarizing the results of the research interviews, and then clarified areas of uncertainty and elaborated on topics that had been insufficiently covered. Even though I was provided with the information from the SCID and SIDP-IV, my evaluation typically lasted for an hour.  It was my impression this method posed no threat to the development of a therapeutic alliance and in fact might have enhanced it because it enabled me to collect developmental and psychosocial history information that I otherwise would not have had time to ascertain because of the time needed to evaluate current psychiatric symptoms.  A comparison of dropout rates between my patients and patients seen in the rest of the practice revealed a higher retention rate in my patients thereby further suggesting that the SCID/SIDP interview did not compromise the therapeutic alliance.  As a result, the comprehensive diagnostic interviews were offered to patients being treated by all psychiatrists in the practice.<br /><br />Through the years the percentage of patients presenting for treatment in our practice who were administered the SCID/SIDP varied according to the availability of diagnostic interviewers and patients\' interest in receiving a more comprehensive interview.  More recently, we have changed the policy in our practice and now require almost all patients to receive the comprehensive evaluation.  Since implementing this change fewer than 10% of patients calling for an appointment decide to seek treatment elsewhere because they are unwilling to undergo such a lengthy evaluation. An important contributor to the success of the MIDAS project has been the support staff who schedule the initial evaluations and who have been educated about the benefits of comprehensive diagnostic evaluations so this can be explained to patients calling to make an initial appointment.<br /><br /><br />An Overview of Results from the MIDAS Project<br /><br />Clinical Epidemiology<br /><br />Community-based epidemiological studies of psychiatric disorders provide important information about the public health burden of these problems. While the frequency of treatment seeking may be increasing (Olfson, Marcus, Druss et al. 2002), epidemiological studies indicate that most patients in the community do not get treatment for psychiatric disorders. Seeking treatment is related to a number of clinical and demographic factors.  Consequently, studies of the frequency and correlates of psychiatric disorders in the general population should be replicated in clinical populations to provide the practicing clinician with information that might have greater clinical utility.  The gap between general population and clinical epidemiological research might be greatest when examining disorder prevalence and diagnostic comorbidity.  Obviously, one cannot extrapolate from community-based prevalence rates to clinical settings where the disorder rates are higher.  Comorbidity rates are also expected to be higher in clinical settings because help-seeking may be related to comorbidity (Berkson 1946).<br /><br />Most clinical epidemiological surveys have been based on unstructured clinical evaluations (Koenigsberg, Kaplan, Gilmore et al. 1985; Mezzich, Fabrega, Coffman et al. 1989; Oldham and Skodol 1991). However, several recent studies have questioned the accuracy and thoroughness of clinical diagnostic interviews. Shear and colleagues (Shear et al. 2000) studied diagnostic accuracy in two community mental health centers, one in urban Pittsburgh and the other in rural western Pennsylvania.  They questioned whether clinicians apply DSM-IV diagnostic criteria in a rigorous manner, and suggested that clinical diagnoses may not be very accurate. Shear et al. interviewed 164 psychiatric outpatients with the SCID after they were evaluated clinically.  More diagnoses were made on the SCID.  Shear and colleagues found that more than one-third of patients were diagnosed with adjustment disorder by the clinicians versus only 7% by the SCID interviewers.  Only 13% of the patients diagnosed by clinicians were given an anxiety disorder diagnosis whereas more than half (53%) of the patients interviewed with the SCID were diagnosed with a current anxiety disorder.  The authors also found that half of the patients with a current primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) on the SCID were diagnosed with adjustment disorder by clinicians.  Shear and colleagues concluded that clinicians\' diagnoses are often inaccurate, and that this poses a barrier to the implementation of treatments that have proven effective for specific disorders.<br /><br />In another study of community mental health patients, this one conducted in Texas, (Basco et al. 2000) psychiatric nurses administered the SCID to patients as a test of the utility of research diagnostic procedures in clinical practice.  They found that supplementing information from the patients\' charts with the information from the SCID resulted in more than five times as many comorbid conditions being diagnosed.  A gold standard diagnosis, consisting of the SCID diagnosis supplemented by chart information and then confirmed by a research psychiatrist or psychologist after interviewing the patient, was made for all patients, and the level of agreement with this standard was higher for the nurse-administered SCID than the clinical diagnoses.<br /><br />Miller and colleagues (Miller, Dasher, Collins et al. 2001) compared diagnoses of 56 psychiatric inpatients evaluated with the traditional diagnostic assessment, SCID, and a computer assisted diagnostic evaluation.  Consistent with the other studies they found that diagnoses were missed by the unstructured clinical diagnostic evaluation compared to the computer-assisted interview.  In addition, diagnoses based on the SCID and computer assisted interview were significantly more highly associated with an all sources of information consensus diagnosis than was the unstructured clinical interview.<br /><br />These studies, together with the findings from the MIDAS project (described below) suggest that clinical epidemiological studies should be based on structured research evaluations.  To obtain accurate disorder prevalence rates in clinical settings it may also be important to assess a broad range of pathology in contrast to a single disorder. Melartin and colleagues (Melartin, Rytsala, Leskela et al. 2002) suggested that studies that focus on a single disorder find higher rates of that disorder compared to studies that assess several different disorders.  It is possible that researchers who have expertise in the study of a particular disorder may be inclined to more frequently diagnose that disorder.<br /><br />The MIDAS project is one of the first clinical epidemiological studies using structured interviews assessing a wide range of psychiatric disorders conducted in general clinical practice.  Among the strengths of the study are that diagnoses are based on the reliable and valid procedures used in research studies, and the patients are presenting to a community-based psychiatric outpatient practice rather than a research clinic specializing in the treatment of one or a few disorders.  A limitation of the study is that it is based in a single site.<br /><br />The characteristics and correlates of several DSM-IV disorders hypothesized to be underdetected by clinicians have been described in case series.  One of the first reports from the MIDAS project focused on one of these disorders&#151;body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), Zimmerman and Mattia 1998). BDD is a distressing and impairing preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance.  In a large case series of patients with BDD, Phillips and colleagues (Phillips, McElroy, Keck et al. 1994) reported that the disorder was associated with significant impairment in academic, occupational, and social functioning.  BDD was also associated with a risk of suicidal behavior (29% of patients had attempted suicide).  Despite its associated suicidal risk and psychosocial impairment, many individuals are so humiliated or ashamed of their BDD symptoms that they keep their concerns secret even from clinicians who have been treating them for years.  The underdiagnosis of BDD has been consistently described in case series and research reports (Phillips 1991; Phillips, McElroy, Keck et al. 1993; Phillips et al. 1994).   There are some studies of the prevalence of BDD in psychiatric patients; however, these studies were limited to patients with selected axis I disorders.  The MIDAS project was the first to assess the presence of BDD in an unselected sample of patients presenting for treatment in an outpatient psychiatric setting.<br /><br />In a sample of 500 patients interviewed with the SCID, 16 (3.2%) patients were diagnosed with BDD.  BDD was the principal diagnosis for three (0.6%) patients and an additional diagnosis for 13 (2.6%) patients. In a separate sample of 500 patients The 500 patients presented to the same practice but not concurrently.  The non-SCID sample was ascertained prior to the SCID sample. They were evaluated with a standard, unstructured clinical interview the prevalence of BDD was 0%. Patients with BDD received more axis I diagnoses than the patients without BDD.  Looking at the specific axis I diagnoses, BDD patients were significantly more likely to have current diagnoses of social phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  The most frequent diagnosis in the BDD patients was MDD; however, BDD patients were no more likely to have MDD than were patients without BDD. The BDD patients were rated significantly lower on the GAF, indicating that their overall level of functioning was poorer. Across all patients the BDD patients were more severely depressed, despite a lack of difference in prevalence rate of MDD.  The patients with BDD were not significantly more likely to have a lifetime history of suicide attempts or psychiatric hospitalization.<br /><br />This study illustrated some of the power of the MIDAS project.  We were able to examine the prevalence of a disorder that is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice and empirically demonstrate that BDD is, in fact, underdiagnosed by clinicians.  We were also able to examine the strength of association between BDD and other psychiatric disorders, and the frequency of BDD in patients with these other disorders.  This information is useful to clinicians who, because they have limited time to conduct diagnostic evaluations, can target higher risk individuals for inquiry about BDD.  Finally, we were able to establish that patients with BDD, compared to patients without BDD, are more severely ill and functionally impaired, but not at greater risk for suicidal behavior.<br /><br />We examined the clinical epidemiology of all Axis I disorders in a separate publication.  Disorder frequency was examined in the first 400 patients interviewed with the SCID (Zimmerman and Mattia 2000).  For patients with more than one disorder, the diagnoses were assigned as principal or additional according to the DSM-IV convention of whether it was the patient\'s stated primary reason for presenting for treatment. The most frequent diagnosis was MDD, which was present in nearly half of the patients. MDD was also the most common principal diagnosis, with more than three-quarters of the depressed patients having this as their principal diagnosis.  The second most common diagnosis was social phobia.  In contrast to MDD which, when present, was usually the principal diagnosis, very few patients with social phobia had it as their principal diagnosis.  The other diagnoses that were present in at least 10% of the sample were posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder with agoraphobia, specific phobia, and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).  Most disorders were more frequently diagnosed as additional disorders rather than the principal disorder.  Only the mood and adjustment disorders were more frequently diagnosed as the principal disorder rather than as an additional disorder.<br /><br />Underrecognition of Psychiatric Comorbidity<br /><br />The recognition of comorbidity has important clinical significance.  Comorbidity predicts poorer outcome for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders, and the presence of multiple psychiatric disorders is associated with greater levels of psychosocial impairment (Grunhaus 1988; Keller, Klerman, Lavori et al. 1984; Noyes, Reich, Christiansen et al. 1990).  In routine clinical settings, an unstructured interview is typically used to assess patients.  Unstructured interviews, however, may result in missed diagnoses, with potential negative clinical consequences.<br /><br />In an early report from the MIDAS project, the goal was to examine whether diagnostic comorbidity is less frequently identified during a routine clinical evaluation than a semistructured diagnostic interview (Zimmerman and Mattia 1999d).  Axis I diagnoses derived from structured and unstructured clinical interviews were compared in two groups of psychiatric outpatients seen in our practice.  Five hundred patients underwent a routine unstructured clinical interview.  Subsequent to the ascertainment of the first sample a second sample of 500 was collected though the individuals in this sample were interviewed with the SCID.  The two groups had similar demographic characteristics and scored similarly on symptom questionnaires.<br /><br />More current diagnoses were made in the SCID sample than the clinical sample (2.3+1.4 vs. 1.4+0.8, t=11.6, p'

The alignment of these 1 &#150; 3 nm sized molecules is probed using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Individual molecules' conformations is modulated by interaction with the strong electric field near the STM tip. This interaction is being explored for purposes related to Molecular Electronics.<br /><br />Bioactive Fluorescent Nanoparticles for Glycoprofiling. We are developing assays to distinguish malignant, benign, and healthy cells based on the identities of the carbohydrates presented on their surface.

S'I am currently working on two projects. <br /><br />The first is a study of political and cultural internationalism in the United States, focusing primarily on the the short period between 1942 and 1948 --during and after World War II but before the Cold War-- when various Americans imagined a number of alternative global futures for the nation. I am interested in the work of popular intellectuals like EB White, Wendell Willkie, Dorothy Thompson, Walter White, and others who earned wide audiences for various forms of "popular internationalism."<br /><br />The second is a long term investigation of the linked discourses of modern selfhood and metropolitan form, concentrating on changing understandings of lived everyday selfhood across the 20th century.<br /><br />My recent book, Manhattan Projects: The Rise and Fall of Urban Renewal in Cold War New York, offers a new look at the politics and culture of urban renewal in Manhattan in the twenty years after World War II. I focus on the ways that superblock planning and modernist architecture remade the cityscape of the postwar city and were themselves remade by resistance to their overweening imposition on the lives of  ordinary New Yorkers. Urban renewal, I show, was at the heart of New York\'s simultaneous rise to "world city" status and fall into the "urban crisis."<br /><br />The book argues that urban renewal in New York is best understood as more than a set of national or municipal policies. I believe that it was also a highly contested vision and cultural symbol, one that was shaped by its interactions with the political culture of the domestic Cold War. In the postwar era the term "urban renewal" came to be understood, by both its proponents and its critics, as a symbol of the way that superblock urban planning and modernist architecture was remaking the daily lives of city-dwellers.  Specifically, I look at four iconic postwar sites&#151;the United Nations Headquarters complex, Metropolitan Life\'s middle-income housing development Stuyvesant Town, the vast belts of public housing in East Harlem, and the Lincoln Square renewal area that included Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts&#151;and show how they were physically and culturally constructed as agents and emblems of urban transformation.  I explain how they were pitched as cures for urban obsolescence, depicted as symbols of a new city, and received by New Yorkers as reorderings of the fundamental experience of city life.'
