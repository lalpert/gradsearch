S"Professor Adams served a tour in the Air Force, and held short-term jobs in design and development in industry before receiving his Ph.D.  After receiving the degree he was employed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California where he was involved in the design of the first spacecraft to explore the Moon, Venus and Mars. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1966.  The courses he has taught at Stanford range from mechanical and product design through courses having to do with the nature of technology.  He is particularly interested in issues having to do with the management of creativity and change in technology-based organizations, with the design process and product design, and with the emotional aspects of technology.  He has consulted and conducted seminars on the topics of creativity, innovation, general problem-solving, organizational change, management of R&D, planning, and design for over 100 commercial clients, ranging from large to small and technical to financial.  He has also been a consultant and lecturer to a large number of government, educational, and professional groups and been a faculty member in many executive programs at Stanford. Adams has held many administrative posts at Stanford including Director of the Design Divison, Chairman of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management  and the program in Science, Technology, and Society,  Chairman of the Faculty Advisory Board, Associate Dean for Special Projects and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the School of Engineering.

S"Aiken's research focuses on developing techniques for the construction of reliable software systems. His interests include both static and dynamic methods of analyzing programs, and span both detecting errors and verifying the absence of errors in software. Most of his research combines a theoretical component (for example, proving the soundness of a analysis technique) and a practical component, which often involves the implementation and measurement of advanced program analysis algorithms. Finally, his research also extends to the design of new programming languages and programming techniques in which it is easier to write software that can be checked for a wide variety of errors."

S"Dr. Altman's primary interests are in the application of computing technologies to basic molecular biological problems, now referred to as bioinformatics. He is particularly interested in the analysis of protein and RNA structure and function, both in an individual problem-centered manner and on a functional genomic scale.  He has an interest in applying systems biology concepts to pharmacology and personalized medicine.  His core initial work was the development of probabilistic algorithms for the determination of protein structure from sparse and uncertain experimental data. These algorithms have been shown to have some advantages over other methods of structure determination including the ability to calculate not only a protein conformation, but also an explicit estimate of the uncertainty in the position of each atom.His current efforts are in three areas.First, he is interested in techniques for representing biological knowledge (not just data) for automatic scientific computation. His group is working on representing the contents of the scientific literature for pharmacogenomics (http://www.pharmgkb.org/) in order to support the task of building robust models of biological systems. As part of this work, the group is also interested in novel user interfaces to biological data, and computational architectures for knowledge environments.Second, he is interested in the analysis of microenvironments within macromolecules. In particular, his group is developing methods for statistically analyzing related structures to infer the key conserved features that distinguish these structures from unrelated structures. This work has implications for the recognition of functional sites in proteins, for protein engineering, and for drug design (http://feature.stanford.edu/).Finally, he is interested in physics-based simulation of biological structures, particularly RNA and proteins. Within this broad area, our focus has been on creating coarse-grain representations of RNA, and on combining machine learning and informatics methods with simulation to maximize the performance of each (http://simbios.stanford.edu/)."

The PRL offers courses, mentors and tools in support of integrated product creation.Pedagogically, Beach believes that creation of experience from which students (and teams of students) can interpret and internalize their own conclusions provides an excellent complement to content based teaching. His goal is to add strength in tacit knowledge which derives from the hands-on synthesis of design, prototype building, presentation and criticism.. The resulting judgment and instinct regarding materials, devices, materials transformation processes, and design process complement classical analytical engineering education to create superior engineers Beach teaches or co-teaches:ME203: Manufacturing and Design ME206: Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability      (with Jim Patell, Erica Estrada, and Stuart Coulson)ME219: The Magic of Materials & Manufacturing(with Kara Johnson)ME314: Good Products, Bad Products ME318: Computer Aided Product Creation ME324: Precision Engineering (with Professor Dan DeBra) ME399: Special Projects in Product Development The PRL has engendered many new companies which design, manufacture and distribute products in diverse domains including Haptic Devices, Medical Devices, Sporting Goods, Underwater Video Equipment, Robotics, and Automated Genomics Laboratory Equipment.'

S"The over-arching goal of Professor Bejerano's lab is to bring vertebrate development and genomics closer together.Research in the lab sits at the intersection of highly cross-fertilizing fields: evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), comparative and functional genomics of extant species, and paleo-genomics (the reconstruction and study of ancestral genomes). Our focus is the functional landscape of vertebrate genomes, and in particular that of the Human Genome.Our computational approaches rely heavily on machine learning, probabilistic and statistical reasoning, and aim to glean novel biological insights. Accordingly, projects range from the pursuit of novel biological knowledge through to the design and implementation of the tools that facilitate these studies."

S'My primary research area is coastal water quality, and recently I have expanded my research to include activities on sanitation more broadly. The work on coastal water quality is focused on understanding the sources, transformation, transport, and ecology of biocolloids - specifically fecal indicator organisms, pathogens, and phytoplankton, as well as sources and fate of nitrogen and phosphorus. This knowledge is crucial to directing new policies, and management and engineering practices that protect human and ecosystem health along the coastal margin. The work on sanitation aims to develop microbial risk assessment models to gain a better understanding of how pathogens are transmitted to humans through their contact with water, feces, and contaminated surfaces. Research is focused on key problems in developed and developing countries. The goal is to design and test effective interventions and technologies for reducing the burden of infectious disease.'

Recent work has centered in three areas: the direct numerical simulation of turbulent shear flows, theoretical studies of the fine-scale structure of turbulence, and experimental measurements of turbulent structure in flames. Experimental studies include the development of particle-tracking methods for measuring velocity fields in unsteady flames and variable density jets. Research in turbulence simulation includes the development of spectral methods for simulating vortex rings, the development of topological methods for interpreting complex fields of data, and simulations of high Reynolds number compressible and incompressible wakes. Theoretical studies include predictions of the asymptotic behavior of drifting vortex pairs and vortex rings and use of group theoretical methods to study the nonlinear dynamics of turbulent fine-scale motions. Current projects include studies of fast-burning fuels for hybrid propulsion and decomposition of nitrous oxide for space propulsion."

S'The Chidsey group research interest is to build the chemical base for molecular electronics. To accomplish this, we synthesize the molecular and nanoscopic systems, build the analytial tools and develop the theoretical understanding with which to study electron transfer between electrodes and among redox species through insulating molecular bridges. Members of the group have synthesized several series of saturated and conjugated oligomers with which we have studied the fundamental aspects of electron tunneling through well-defined molecular bridges. The oligophenylenevinylene bridge of these molecules promotes rapid tunneling over remarkably long distances compared with other unsaturated and saturated bridges we have studied. For instance, starting in the activated complex, the tunneling rate between a gold electrode and an appended ferrocene through 3.5nm of an oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) bridge is 8 x 10 9 s-1 whereas the tunneling rate through an alkane bridge of the same length is expected to be slower than 1s -1.To date our electron-tunneling studies have largely focused on what we casually denote as a "one-electrode" measurement with the molecular bridge connecting one electrode to a redox species which acts as a molecular capacitor to an ionically conducting solution. The other electrodes necessary to measure the tunneling conduction are remotely located in an electrochemical cell. We are currently embarked on a broad based effort to make conduction measurements with two electrodes, one on each end of a single molecule. We are also developing strategies to include one or more additional electrodes so that molecular circuits with electrical power gain can be assembled. This effort is leading us to develop nanostructured wiring schemes and self-assembly methods for the construction of whole circuits of wired molecules. We will be examining nanowires formed from doped silicon and other substances. This emerging effort in nanowiring will be greatly aided by the previous work in the Chidsey lab on the surface chemistry of silicon, particularly the self-assembly of complex molecular monolayers on silicon surfaces.'

The main goal is to develop new technologies for basic science and biomedical applications. Clinical applications of the research involve bone and wound healing, biomimetic corneas, neural cell regeneration, and cancer imaging and therapy. Professor Cochran\x92s research is driven by the philosophy that in order to control physiological processes it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive these processes. Her group is interested in elucidating molecular details of receptor-mediated cell signaling events; at the same time developing protein and polymer-basedtools that will allow manipulation of cellular processes on a molecular level. For biomedical applications, they combine rational design and combinatorial methods to create designer protein therapeutics and diagnostic agents. One such example is highlighted in a recent <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/may24/cochran-052406.html"> press release.</a>'

S'Richard W. (Dick) Cottle was born in Chicago in 1934. He received his elementary and high school education in the neighboring village of Oak Park. Dick enrolled at Harvard College to take up political science and premedical studies in order to become a physician (or possibly a foreign service officer if that didn\'t work out). As it happened, both of these alternatives were abandoned because he was strongly attracted to mathematics and ultimately received his bachelor\'s degree in that field. He stayed on at Harvard and received the master\'s degree in mathematics in 1958. This was the Sputnik era, and Dick was moved by a passion to teach secondary-level mathematics. In the first of a series of fateful decisions, he joined the Mathematics Department at the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts where for two years he taught grades 7-12. Midway through this period he married his wife Suzanne (Sue). At this time he began to think of returning to graduate school for a doctorate in mathematics. He decided to study geometry at the University of California at Berkeley and was admitted there. Just before leaving Middlesex, Dick received a telephone call from the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley offering him the part- time job as a computer programmer for which he had applied. Through this job, he became aware of linear and quadratic programming and the contributions of George Dantzig and Philip Wolfe. Before long, Dick left the Rad Lab to join Dantzig\'s team at the Operations Research Center at UC Berkeley.Under the tutelage of George Dantzig (and the late Edmund Eisenberg), Dick developed a symmetric duality theory and what was then called the "composite problem". These topics along with a re\xebxamination of the Fritz John conditions, formed the core of his doctoral dissertation. The composite problem involved a fusion of the primal and dual first-order optimality conditions. It was realized that the resulting inequality system could be studied without reference to the primal-dual structure out of which it was born. The name "complementarity problem" was suggested by Dick and introduced in a joint paper with Habetler and Lemke. After Berkeley, Dick\'s work took two closely related directions. One was the study of quadratic programming; the other was what we now call "linear complementarity". The interesting role played by classes of matrices in both these areas has always held a special fascination for Dick. In quadratic programming, for instance, with Jacques Ferland he obtained characterizations of quasi- and pseudo-convexity of quadratic functions. Dick (and others) were quick to recognize the importance of matrix classes in linear complementarity theory. It was he who proposed the name "copositive-plus" for a matrix class that arose in Lemke\'s seminal paper of 1965. The name first appeared in the classic paper of Cottle and Dantzig called "Complementary Pivot Theory of Mathematical Programming". The subjects of quadratic programming and linear complementarity (and the associated matrix theory) remain central to his research interests.'

S'Charles Debbas established Debbas Architecture in Berkeley, CA, in 1989 quickly carving a niche as an architect whose work is fluid, well proportioned and non-traditional.  His work attempts to capture the spirit of each project individually staying clear of trends or solidly anchored styles of architecture, allowing it to embrace genuine and timeless solutions.  In 1997, Charles designed and launched the Ergopen, a unique ergonomic pen.  He sold the company to BIC in 2001 but contiues to be one of their main product designers.'

S'Professor DeBra collaborates with Stanford physicists on three projects: Gravity Probe-B (GP-B), Space Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP), and the vibration isolation of a gravity-wave antenna (LIGO). These involve satellite control of attitude and translation and the development of instruments of extraordinary precision and accuracy. In GP-B gyroscopes were successfully orbited in 2004. They have been compared to stars to an accuracy approaching a nanoradian. In STEP the orbital performance promises improvements of a million in testing the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. (It is currently in a hiatus of funding.) Professor DeBra\'s interests in precision engineering extend to manufacturing where his students\' work developing "quiet hydraulics" in the 1990\'s has more recently been applied to the vibration isolation of the optical systems of LIGO.'

S'Generation of force and motion inside living cells.</b>  Almost all the work in understanding how motor proteins work has been done under highly artificial conditions, abstracted from the cellular milieu in which the proteins actually work. Recent results demonstrate that the internal structure of the cell is pre-tensioned, and that generating, releasing, and sensing this tension is a key element in controlling how the cell reacts to its environment. We will observe single motors at work inside living cells.  Our goal is to understand how the cell generates, detects, and manages tension at the molecular level.  The results from this project will be highly relevant to many aspects of human health, including heart disease, cancer metastasis, and the development of stem cell therapies.'

S'Structure and Dynamics of Polymers in Constrained Geometry</b><br/>The properties of ultrathin polymer films are often different from their bulk counterparts. We use spin casting, Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, and surface grafting to fabricate ultrathin films in the range of 100 to 1000 Angstroms thick. Macromolecular amphiphiles are examined at the air-water interface by surface pressure, Brewster angle microscopy, and interfacial shear measurements and on solid substrates by atomic force microscopy, FTIR, and ellipsometry. A vapor-deposition-polymerization process has been developed for covalent grafting of poly(amino acids) from solid substrates. FTIR measurements permit study of secondary structures (right and left-handed alpha helices, parallel and anti-parallel beta sheets) as a function of temperature and environment.</p>Interface Science of Biomolecular Materials</b><br/>The cell membrane is a wonderfully complex structure having a phospholipids matrix with a wide variety of associated and integral membrane proteins. We are exploring highly simplified analogues of the cell membrane for possible applications in bioanalytical devices. Vesicles or liposomes of phospholipids are prepared by sonication or membrane extrusion and characterized by dynamic light scattering. The kinetics of adsorption of these vesicles on a solid substrate followed by fusion to form a continuous supported bilayer is followed by the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. This instrument allows determination of both the mass deposition as well as the viscoelastic coupling of the adsorbed film with the surrounding fluid. Fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching is used to monitor the lateral diffusivity of labeled lipids.</p>Polymer Development of an Artificial Cornea Based on Polymer Hydrogels</b><br/>A broadly interdisciplinary collaboration has been established with the Department of Ophthalmology in the Stanford School of Medicine. We have designed and synthesized a fully interpenetrating network of two different hydrogel materials that have properties consistent with application as a substitute for the human cornea: high water swellability up to 85%,tensile strength comparable to the cornea, high glucose permeability comparable to the cornea, and sufficient tear strength to permit suturing. We have developed a technique for surface modification with adhesion peptides that allows binding of collagen and subsequent growth of epithelial cells. Broad questions on the relationships among molecular structure, processing protocol, and biomedical device application are being pursued.</p>To view a list of his Professorships, see his <a href="http://chemenew.stanford.edu/faculty/profiles/cwfrank/cwfrank.html">department page</a>.</p>'

S'Complex Fluids and Complex Fluid InterfacesOrientation Dynamics and Complex Liquids</b>The processing of complex liquids (polymers, suspensions, emulsions, biological fluids) alters their microstructure through orientation and deformation of their constitutive elements. In the case of polymeric liquids, it is of interest to obtain in situ measurements of segmental orientation and optical methods have proven to be an excellent means of acquiring this information. Research in our laboratory has resulted in a number of techniques in optical rheometry such as high-speed polarimetry (birefringence and dichroism) and various microscopy methods (fluorescence, phase contrast, and atomic force microscopy).Elegant flow-processing techniques have been developed to produce organized, biocompatible structures for applications in tissue engineering. Collagen, protein commonly found in load-bearing tissues, possesses the unique ability to organize into complex ordered structures due to its liquid crystalline properties. The result is an oriented substrate of collagen capable of inducing cellular level control. It has been observed that cells will respond to the substrate\x92s ordered microstructure by polarizing themselves to align in the direction of flow deposition. Another application of orientation dynamics is in the development of solar cells. The efficiency of second-generation solar cells fabricated with conjugated polymers is limited by photoelectron transport within the polymer film. Inspired by electrorheological fluids, an external electric field is applied to the film to induce anisotropy in polymer crystallites, which is expected to enhance electron mobility. The microstructure of polymeric and other complex materials also cause them to have interesting physical properties and respond to different flow conditions in unusual manners.  In our laboratory, we are equipped with instruments that are able to characterize these materials such as shear rheometer, capillary break up extensional rheometer, and 2D extensional rheometer.  Then, the response of these materials to different flow conditions can be visualized and analyzed in detail using high speed imaging devices at up to 2,000 frames per second.  Interfacial Dynamics and Rheology</b>There are numerous processes encountered in nature and industry where the deformation of fluid-fluid interfaces is of central importance. Examples from nature include deformation of the red blood cell in small capillaries, cell division and structure and composition of the tear film. Industrial applications include the processing of emulsions and foams, and the atomization of droplets in ink-jet printing. In our laboratory, fundamental research is in progress to understand the orientation and deformation of monolayers at the molecular level. These experiments employ state of the art optical methods such as polarization modulated dichroism, fluorescence microscopy, and Brewster angle microscopy to obtain in situ measurements of polymer films and small molecule amphiphile monolayers subject to flow. Langmuir troughs are used as the experimental platform so that the thermodynamic state of the monolayers can be systematically controlled. For the first time, well characterized, homogeneous surface flows have been developed, and real time measurements of molecular and microdomain orientation have been obtained. These microstructural experiments are complemented by measurements of the macroscopic, mechanical properties of the films.'

S'My research interests encompass the physics and mathematics of imaging with Magnetic Resonance. Presently my research is directed in part towards exploration of rapid MRI scanning methods using spiral and other non-Cartesian k-space trajectories for dynamic imaging of function. Using spiral techniques, we have developed MRI pulse sequences and processing methods for mapping cortical brain function by imaging the metabolic response to various stimuli, with applications in the basic neurosciences as well as for clinical applications. These methods develop differential image contrast from hemodynamically driven increases in oxygen content in the vascular bed of activated cortex, using pulse sequences sensitive to the paramagnetic behavior of deoxyhemoglobin or to the blood flow changes. Other applications include imaging of contrast uptake in the breast.'

S'My laboratory employs diverse interdisciplinary methods of inquiry to understand the relationships among cell shape detection, determination, and maintenance in bacteria. Cell shape plays a critical role in regulating many physiological functions, yet little is known about how the wide variety of cell shapes are determined and maintained. Inside the cell, many proteins organize and segregate, but how they detect and respond to the cellular morphology to end up at the right place at the right time is also largely mysterious. The group uses a combination of analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to probe physical mechanisms of shape-related self-organization in protein networks, membranes, and the cell wall. Current topics of interest are (i) cell-wall biosynthesis, (ii) the regulation and mechanics of cell division, (iii) membrane organization, and (iv) membrane-mediated protein interactions. Ultimately, the manipulation of cell shape may provide a direct tool for engineering complex cellular behaviors.'

S'Recent years have seen unprecedented motivation for the emergence of new energy technologies. Global dependence on fossil fuels, however, will persist until alternate technologies can compete economically. We must develop means to produce energy (or energy carriers) from renewable sources and then convert them to work as efficiently and cleanly as possible. Catalysis is energy conversion, and the Jaramillo laboratory focuses on fundamental catalytic processes occurring on solid-state surfaces in both the production and consumption of energy. Chemical-to-electrical and electrical-to-chemical energy conversion are at the core of the research. Nanoparticles, metals, alloys, sulfides, nitrides, carbides, phosphides, oxides, and biomimetic organo-metallic complexes comprise the toolkit of materials that can help change the energy landscape. Tailoring catalyst surfaces to fit the chemistry is our primary challenge.</p>Fuel Cells</strong><br />A fuel cell is a promising energy conversion device in which chemical energy is directly converted to electrical energy, for example: H2 + 1/2O2 &#8594; H2O, DG = -1.23 eV. Despite the attractiveness of fuel cell technologies, a number of materials-related problems have hindered their wide-spread use. Projects in this area are geared for the development of promising new electrocatalytic materials by studying fundamental electrochemical surface phenomena, with the ultimate aim of overcoming the technological challenges in fuel cell catalysis. In the case of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the greatest challenge is the cathode, where much of the cell voltage must be "consumed" in order to drive the sluggish reaction kinetics of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), O2 + 4H+ + 4e- &#8594; 2H2O. The potential at which the cathode operates is also problematic, as unwanted surface chemistry is often induced, including surface oxidation, poisoning by OH- adsorption, or electrochemical dissolution. New materials are needed as the best catalysts for this reaction are based on Pt or Pt-group metals which are scarce and expensive. Similar problems exist at the anode; earth-abundant and catalytically active materials are needed for the oxidation of fuels such as hydrogen and methanol with the constraint that they must also be tolerant to possible catalyst poisons such as carbon monoxide or CHx species, which are ubiquitous in fuel feeds, or could even exist as reaction intermediates.</p>To view Jaramillo\x92s full Research Statement, Current Students and Researchers list, see his <a href="http://chemenew.stanford.edu/faculty/profiles/jaramillo/jaramillo.html">department page</a>.</p>'

S"My lab studies speech and language understanding and production in both humans and machines.  On the human side, we use computational and probabilistic models to understand how humans comprehend and produce language (How do we understand sentences? How do we produce words?).  For example we have shown that humans are subconscious probabilistic reasonersin dealing with language, and that computation of these probabilities is sensitive to contextual factors (like who you're speaking to!).  On the engineeering side, we leverage this knowledge about human processing to build better computational tools for tasks like understanding meaning or inducing language structures from raw text, automatic recognition and synthesis of speech, or automatic question answering.  We also apply natural language processing to answer social science questions, such as exploring the history of science by extracting ideas from on-line papers."

These devices are usually fabricated from silicon wafers using integrated circuit fabrication tools.  Using these techniques, the group builds sensitive accelerometers, infrared detectors, and force-sensing cantilevers.  This research has many applications, including integrated packaging, inertial navigation, fundamental force measurements, experiments on bio-molecules, device cooling, bio-analytical instruments, and small robots.  Because this research field is multidisciplinary in nature, work in this group is characterized by strong collaborations with other departments, as well as with local industry."

S"Research interests in Khosla's laboratory lie at the interface of enzyme chemistry and medicine.For the past several years, we have investigated the catalytic mechanisms of modular megasynthases such as polyketide synthases, with the concomitant goal of harnessing their programmable chemistry for preparing pharmaceutically relevant natural products. Recent accomplishments include methods for heterologous production of polyketides; genetically reprogrammed biosynthesis of anthraquinones and polypropionates; and chemo-biosynthesis of new polyketides not readily affordable by synthetic or biological methods alone. These methodologies are already finding practical use. At the same time, we have placed a major emphasis on the biochemistry and structural biology of these giant protein assemblies. Fundamental insights into assembly line biosynthetic mechanisms have emerged, including the finding that protein-protein interactions play a central role in intermodular communications. In turn, these insights are highlighting opportunities for enhancing the efficiency of biosynthetic engineering. Over the next decade we envision that the predictive power of polyketide biosynthetic engineering will mature analogous to current protein engineering capabilities.More recently, we have investigated the pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue, an HLA-DQ2 associated inflammatory disease of the small intestine that is induced by exposure to gluten from foodgrains such as wheat, rye and barley. Within the past few years, we have explored three potential therapeutic strategies for this widespread but overlooked disease. By dissecting the unique chemical features of gluten, we discovered an intimate link between proteolytic stability and immunotoxicity of gluten, and translated this knowledge into the design of an oral enzyme therapy for the disease. We have also synthesized and evaluated mechanism-based inhibitors of human transglutaminase 2, the predominant disease associated auto-antigen, and used them to deduce the high-resolution structure of the antigen-bound protein. Finally, our structural and mechanistic dissection of HLA-DQ2 has been used to design, synthesize and evaluate gluten peptide analogues that selectively inhibit disease associated T cells. We remain committed to the vision that, within the next decade, safe and effective drugs will start having measurable impact on the health of celiac sprue patients."

Studies of unconventional configurations employ rapid turnaround analysis methods in the design of efficient subsonic and supersonic commercial aircraft. Recent research has included investigation of configurations such as joined wings, oblique wings, and tailless aircraft. Nonlinear low-speed aerodynamics studies have focused on vortex wake roll-up, refined computation of induced drag, the design of wing tips, and the aerodynamics of maneuvering aircraft."

My area of professional expertise is Computational Biomechanics, the creation of theoretical and computational models to predict the acute and chronic response of living biological tissue to environmental changes during development and disease progression. My specific interest is the multiscale modeling of growth and remodeling, the study of how biological tissues adapt their form and function to changes in mechanical loading, and how this adaptation could be traced back to structural alterations on the cellular or molecular levels. Growth and remodeling might be induced naturally, e.g., through elevated pressure, stress, or strain, or interventionally, e.g., through prostheses, stents, tissue grafts, or stem cell injection. Combining theories of electrophysiology, biophysics, and continuum mechanics, my lab has specialized in predicting the chronic loss of form and function in growing and remodeling cardiac tissue using patient-specific custom-designed finite element models.'

S'Is it possible to understand the molecular structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids in enough detail to make accurate predictions about structure and function? We are mounting a two-pronged attack on this problem using both molecular dynamics simulation and molecular modeling.(i) Simulation attempts to reproduce the structural, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of a macromolecule in as accurate a way as possible. Starting with simple but realistic expressions for the interactions between atoms and classical laws of motion, we calculate a trajectory that specifies the position and velocity of every atom as a function of time. The time-step between calculated structures is small at 10-15 seconds, and we need to reduce hundreds of thousands of sets of atomic coordinates into a simple coherent description. We have simulated with reasonable fidelity the measurable static and dynamic properties of the several different proteins surrounded by thousands of water molecules. Simulation at different temperatures has allowed exploration of the pathways of protein denaturation of entire proteins and small fragments of protein secondary structure (a-helices and \xdf-hairpins). Companion studies of DNA double-helix segments in solution preserve the classical double helix while still showing a wide repertoire of interesting motions. (ii) Molecular modeling attempts to build a model of a macromolecule using known three-dimensional structures and energy minimization as complementary guidelines. Specific examples of this work include the automatic modeling of antibody variable domains, the general modeling of homologous proteins and studies of DNA base-pair mismatches. Questions we are trying to answer include: How can a protein be stabilized by a single amino acid change? How does the sequence of DNA cause local variations of double-helix conformation and stability? Extensive use is made of sophisticated programming, sequence and structural data bases, and computer graphics'

Projects to develop and operate civil infrastructure increasingly involve private, public and NGO participants from multiple countries, resulting in clashes between participants\' values, cultural norms and laws that can create high "institutional costs" and attendant delays.Levitt\'s current research, conducted through the Collaboratory for Research on Global Projects (CRGP), which he founded and directs, is aimed at developing new financing, governance and organizational approaches to enhance the long-term financial, environmental and social sustainability of these critically needed, but institutionally challenging, projects.'

S'Manoharan\'s research program seeks to apply the "bottom-up" approach of atomic and molecular manipulation to a variety of outstanding problems in science and technology.  The effort is interdisciplinary in nature, centering on physics and engineering but involving ideas, techniques, and conundrums from other fields such as chemistry, biology, materials science, and information technology.  The primary experimental apparatus for these investigations are custom-built low-temperature scanning probe microscopes capable of both studying and controlling matter at atomic length scales.  Research projects, whose motivations are drawn from several research frontiers, include:  Nanoassembly using Atomic and Molecular Manipulation, Studies of Isolated and Interacting Magnetic Moments, Local Probes of Correlated Electrons in Reduced Dimensions, Local Response of Novel Superconductors, Exploring New Paradigms in Computation, Atomic and Molecular Electronics, Organic Molecules and the Structure of Life.'

S"Melosh's research is focused on developing methods to detect and control chemical processes on the nanoscale, to create materials that are responsive to their local environment. The research goal incorporates many of the hallmarks of biological adaptability, based on feedback control between cellular receptors and protein expression. Similar artificial networks may be achieved by fabricating arrays of nanoscale (<100 nm) devices that can detect and influence their local surroundings through ionic potential, temperature, mechanical motion, capacitance, or electrochemistry. These devices are particularly suited as 'smart' biomaterials, where multiple surface-cell interactions must be monitored and adjusted simultaneously for optimal cell adhesion and growth. Other interests include precise control over self-assembled materials, and potential methods to monitor the diagnostics of complicated chemical systems, such as the effect of drug treatments within patients.Research Interests:</b>Molecular materials at interfaces Directed dynamic self-assembly Controlling molecular or biomolecular assembly and behavior Influence of local electronic, optical or thermal stimuli."

S'Most physical, chemical and biophysical experiments in condensed phases measure the average behavior of a huge number of molecules, from millions to billions to Avogadro\x92s Number. At the same time, most theoretical models describe the behavior of a single molecule interacting with its surroundings, and ensemble averaging over the number of molecules N is normally required to compute an observable. To explore what happens when ensemble averaging is removed, we use single-molecule optical spectroscopy, a set of ultrasensitive far-field and near-field laser techniques that allow us to detect and probe the detailed properties of individual molecules (N=1). In this way we can explore truly local behavior inside a solid, a liquid, or in a biomolecular system such as a protein in vitro or most recently, even a protein structure in a cell. Why is this new regime of single-molecule nanoscience fascinating? Complex systems such as condensed matter or biomolecules can contain hidden heterogeneity produced by different local environments, different conformational states, or even different protein folds. Single-molecule studies allow us to explore hidden heterogeneity because we measure the distribution of behavior by recording the properties of each member of the ensemble, one by one. There are several specific ways single molecule measurements can provide new information. Photochemistry or other photophysical changes in the immediate local environment can be detected as changes in resonant frequency or emission spectrum of the single molecule (spectral diffusion). We also obtain kinetic information from the detailed time dependence of the photon emission, or from the polarization changes that occur when the fluorophore rotates, or from the physical motion of the single-molecule label due to diffusion or other effects. By measuring energy transfer between two different fluorophores, distance information on the 5-9 nm scale can be obtained. Within the cell, many functional changes take place as a result of the action of a small number of copies of a protein or oligonucleotide, thus extreme sensitivity is required to understand how the system works. In collaboration with the molecular biology and biochemistry communities, we hope to discover how much can be learned with such single-molecule biophysical measurements. Recent studies have explored various genetically encoded fluorescent proteins like GFP, kinesin molecular motors, Ca++ ion concentration sensors, transmembrane proteins of the immune system in living cells, and genetic regulatory proteins in bacteria. Single fluorophores are also being used to explore local polymer dynamics in entangled systems. Single molecules also provide window into a growing new field, nanophotonics. We have used a single molecule to make a quantum mechanical (non-Poissonian) light source operating at room temperature. From another point of view, a single molecule can be viewed as a probe of its immediate local nanoenvironment on the scale on the order of the molecular size (~1 nm). At the same time, nanoscale electromagnetic structures can themselves perturb or enhance the molecular emission. In the future, a single molecule might be used as a readout element for a molecular scale device.'

Since its birth in 1956, the AI dream has been to build systems that exhibit "broad spectrum" intelligence.  However, AI has since splintered intomany different subfields, such as machine learning, vision, navigation, reasoning, planning, and natural language processing.  To realize its vision of a home assistant robot, STAIR will unify into a single platform tools drawn from all of these AI subfields. This is in distinct contrast to the 30-year-old trend of working on fragmented AI sub-fields, so that STAIR is also a unique vehicle for driving forward research towards true, integrated AI.Ng also works on machine learning algorithms for robotic control, in which rather than relying on months of human hand-engineering to design a controller, a robot instead learns automatically how best to control itself.  Using this approach, Ng\'s group has developed by far the most advanced autonomous helicopter controller, that is capable of flying spectacular aerobatic maneuvers that even experienced human pilots often find extremely difficult to execute.  As part of this work, Ng\'s group also developed algorithms that can take a single image,and turn the picture into a 3-D model that one can fly-through and see from different angles.'

S"I have been engaged in the study of mechanical properties of materials for more than 40 years.  My early work was on high temperature creep and fracture of metals, focusing on techniques for measuring internal back stresses in deforming metals and featuring the modeling of diffusional deformation and cavity growth processes.  My students and I also studied high temperature dispersion strengthening mechanisms and described the effects of threshold stresses on these creep processes.  Since the mid-1980's we have focused most of our attention on the mechanical properties of thin film materials used in microprocessors and related devices.  We have developed many of the techniques that are now used to study of thin film mechanical properties, including nanoindentation, substrate curvature methods, bulge testing methods and the mechanical testing of micromachined (MEMS) structures.  We are also known for our work on the mechanisms of strain relaxation in heteroepitaxial thin films and plastic deformation of thin metal films on substrates.  In addition we have engaged in research on the growth, characterization and modeling of thin film microstructures, especially as they relate to the development of intrinsic stresses.   Our current work deals with the mechanical properties of nanostructures and with strain gradients and size effects on the mechanical properties of crystalline materials."

The metabolic pathways that produce these compounds are key to developing sustainable biofuel feedstocks, protecting crops from pathogens, and discovering new natural-product based therapeutics for human disease. These applications motivate us to find new ways to elucidate and engineer plant metabolism. We use a multidisciplinary approach combining chemistry, enzymology, genetics, and metabolomics to tackle problems that include new methods for delignification of lignocellulosic biomass and the engineering of plant antibiotic biosynthesis.'

S'of Biological Sciences and of Applied Physics. He is a faculty member of the Neuroscience, Biophysics, and Molecular Imaging Programs in the Stanford School of Medicine, as well as of the Stanford Brain Research Institute. Schnitzer has longstanding interests in neural circuit dynamics and optical imaging, and his laboratory has two major research efforts that are mutually complementary: In vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging studies of cerebellar-dependent learning and memory. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning is one of the simplest and earliest known forms of associative memory. A modern version of such conditioning that is suitable for use in mice and that depends critically on cerebellar function is classical eyeblink conditioning, in which a subject is trained to blink in response to a conditioning stimulus such as an audible tone. Many theories of how this cerebellar-dependent form of learning occurs focus on cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which exhibit highly regular anatomical patterns of neural connections. The Schnitzer lab has shown that they can image up to ~50 Purkinje cells simultaneously in live mice using in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging. By combining in vivo imaging and electrophysiological techniques with behavioral and computational approaches, the lab seeks to understand the neural circuit dynamics in the cerebellar cortex that underlie learning, memory, and forgetting. Fiber optic fluorescence microendoscopy. The Schnitzer group has recently invented two forms of fiber optic fluorescence imaging, respectively termed one- and two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy, that enable minimally invasive in vivo imaging of cells within deep (brain) tissues with micron-scale resolution. For example, the group has been able to obtain video-rate movies of red blood cell flow within the rat hippocampus and thalamus, and to visualize hippocampal neurons and dendrites within live mice. The Schnitzer group now seeks to develop and apply microendoscopy to applications in both basic neurobiology and clinical settings. The ability to image cells deep within the live mammalian brain promises to permit studies of how cellular properties are impacted by environment, training, or over the course of life.'

S"Scott's research is aimed at learning fundamental molecular mechanisms of development, including gene regulation and cell-cell signaling.  He also studies the formation and function of brain circuitry.  He works with cultured cells, Drosophila, and mice to investigate how normal embryos grow and what goes wrong in birth defects, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. A major goal is to identify and explore new genes and proteins that control development. The lab group investigates the development of the nervous system, especially the cerebellum, using cell and tissue culture, genomics, and transgenic animals. Cells are grown on controlled and patterned surfaces to govern neurite outgrowth. To investigate signal transduction between and within cells, the group studies regulators that control cell morphology and intracellular trafficking. Time-lapse video of engineered proteins is combined with genetic modifications that alter cell-cell signaling and the assembly and transport of organelles. Imaging and image processing are important tools. Collaborative engineering projects include the invention of an embryo sorting instrument and the development of new injection methods applicable to high-throughput screens of gene functions."

S"A task common to many application domains is the analysis of data accumulated over time, leading to identification of past and present trends and to episodic decisions made on the basis of the previous and the current state of the world. An example of such a task in the medical domain is managing patients who are being treated with clinical guidelines. An inherent requirement of such tasks is to accumulate and to analyze patient data over time and constantly to revise an assessment of the patient's state by abstracting higher-level, context-sensitive concepts from the raw input data. These higher-level concepts can be used for summarizing large medical databases, for monitoring, for replanning therapy, for providing explanations to a user of a decision-support system, and as a basis for a more intelligent dialog between an automated decision-support system and a human health-care provider. My work focuses on defining basic knowledge-based, domain-independent temporal-abstraction mechanisms and the formal knowledge needed to instantiate them in any particular medical domain. Formalization of temporal-abstraction knowledge supports the acquisition, representation, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of that knowledge. I have therefore defined a knowlede-based temporal-abstraction framework, implemented it as the R\xc9SUM\xc9 system, and tested it in several clinical domains. The framework is currently being expanded, on one hand, and embedded in a larger architecture, Tzolkin, that will combine temporal-reasoning and temporal-maintenance services. Tzolkin is used within the EON component-based architecure for guideline-based care. I am also leading the KNAVE (knowledge-based Navigation of Abstractions for Visualization and Explanation) project, which focuses on an interactive framework for visualization and exploration of time-oriented data (e.g., patient clinical data) and their multiple-levels of abstractions. I also am interested in (therapy) plan generation, revision, recognition and critiquing in clinical domains; I am leading the Asgaard project, which investigates these tasks. Finally, I am interested in decision-theoretical aspects of clinical decision making, and I am heading the PANDA project, which applies decision analytic methodologies to the domain of genetic consultation."

This technology has been extended to efficiently construct multi-input devices exhibiting various higher-order information processing functions, demonstrating combinatorial assembly of many information processing, transduction, and control devices from a smaller number of components. Her laboratory is applying these technologies to addressing key challenges in cellular therapeutics, targeted molecular therapies, and green biosynthesis strategies."

S'Theory of Biological Systems and Complex Fluids<br />Overview</strong><br />Our research group utilizes analytical theory and computational techniques to address the physics of biological systems and complex fluids. Our approach makes use of a range of theoretical and computational methods in statistical mechanics and polymer physics, including analytical theory of semiflexible polymers, polymer field theory, Brownian dynamics simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation. We focus on several experimental systems that are of scientific and technological importance, addressing the physical phenomena that underlie the observed behavior. For example, we study the physical manipulation of DNA in single-molecule experiments and in the packaging of an organism\x92s genome. This theoretical effort aims to understand the exquisite control that Nature has over the DNA molecule and how we can mimic such methods in technological applications.</p>Single-molecule Biophysics</strong><br />Single-molecule manipulation plays an important role in our understanding of a wide range of biological processes. Experimental techniques for physically manipulating individual molecules have progressed in resolution to the point where processes that occur on the length scale of a couple of Angstroms can be detected, thus making it possible to directly observe a number of biological phenomena in situ. At this minute length scale, thermal fluctuations play a pivotal role in the physical behavior of these systems and act to compromise the resolution of the experimental measurement. Our theoretical work aims to predict the behavior in single-molecule experiments, providing a robust method to interpret their results and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We develop a theoretical framework for predicting the behavior of tethered-bead single-molecule experiments. Using our exact results for the statistical behavior of the molecular tether as a semiflexible polymer, we provide a formalism that is both accurate and easily implemented into experiments. This framework provides the flexibility to address a wide range of outstanding physical issues that play an important role in single-molecule biophysics.</p>DNA Packaging in Chromatin</strong><br />Our genome contains roughly a billion base pairs and is approximately 1 meter in length. This DNA strand must be packaged within a nucleus that is about 1 micron across while remaining accessible to the nuclear environment for protein expression. This engineering feat is accomplished by histone proteins that wrap the DNA into a hierarchical structure called chromatin. The first level in this hierarchical assembly is the nucleosome core particle, which consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone protein complex. We build a model of the nucleosome core particle for comparison with single-molecule experiments in order to assign quantitative values to the adhesion strengths that lead to nucleosome formation. In so doing, we predict the forces that must be overcome to gain access to the packaged genomic code, lending insight into how to condense DNA and maintain accessibility in gene therapy applications. Our long term goal is to systematically address the assembly of chromatin starting from the nucleosomal level and leading to the hierarchical structure of the chromatin fiber.</p>Viral Packaging of DNA</strong><br />We address the internal structure of the DNA strand in order to predict the forces required to package the viral genome and to understand the degree of order necessary for the subsequent ejection of the packaged DNA. Future work will focus on the packaging of single-stranded DNA into Adeno-associated virus in order to optimize packaging for a viral-based gene therapy application.</p>'

Current projects include optimized mapping of metabolite distributions in the brain and acquisition and analyis of dynamic MRI for the assessment of kidney function. In our laboratory, we have focussed on an array of novel techniques for producing clinically valuable images of important metabolic chemicals (e.g., NAA, creatine, choline, and lactate). These techniques, which include improved spectroscopic imaging and shimming methods as well as the application of estimation theory for optimal data quantification, address the inherent difficulties of low concentrations of the desired components, overlapping resonances, and field inhomogeneities caused by imperfect magnets and magnetic susceptibility variations with the body. Applications of this work include cerebral stoke evaluation as well as cancer diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prediction of response to therapy. In addition, we are conducting basic research into a variety of neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy."

S'Our overall research is directed to understand, on a fundamental level, molecular processes in microbes that are important for environmental as well as medical processes.1) Molecular interactions of microbes in complex environments</strong><br />Most microbes that exist in nature or in association with hosts live in surface-associated communities, often referred to as biofilms. Biofilms play critical roles in water clean-up and bioremediation processes but are also of concern in medical implant-associated and oral diseases. The fundamental mechanism(s) how microbes adhere to a surface and how to excise and detach from a biofilm are largely unknown. In a combined genetic and physiological approach we investigate the molecular machinery that controls biofilm stability. This includes elucidating the actual molecular mechanism of how cells stick to a biofilm, as well as the regulation of such machinery. Results from these studies have implications of how to control biofilm-related diseases and environmental processes.</p>2) Cellular level of c-di-GMP signaling</strong><br />We discovered in our biofilm research that the stability of biofilms is controlled by a novel intracellular second messenger molecule, cyclic-di-GMP. Besides affecting biofilm formation, other aspects of microbial physiology such as motility, virulence, and also metabolic processes, are controlled by c-di-GMP in response to environmental signals. c-di-GMP may function on the allosteric but also on a transcriptional level. Moreover, analyzes of microbial genomes revealed the presence of dozens of diguanylate cyclase, catalyzing the synthesis of c-di-GMP from 2 GTP, as well as c-di-GMP hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases in genomes of microbes that exist in fluctuating environments. We seek to understand the molecular basis of c-di-GMP signaling (sensing the environment, signal transduction, control of activity of effector molecules), as well as the molecular logic of signal integration using a genome level approach. In a combination of genetic, biochemical, and physiological approaches, we are dissecting the circuitry of c-di-GMP signaling in Shewanella oneidensis and Vibrio cholerae.</p>3) Molecular evolution of new genetic traits in microbes</strong><br />We have found that genetic variants rapidly arise in biofilm environments, thereby, contributing to the functional diversification in such environments. However, the molecular causes and consequences of such rapid evolution are unclear. Making use of the power of microbial evolution (rapid generation time and large population size), we are conducting studies on the molecular evolution of new genetic traits in response to specific selective pressures. In an extension of this approach, we are also pursuing the experimental evolution of microbial interactions, specifically the evolution of mutualism. We also explore how experimental evolution can be used as a molecular engineering tool to evolve industrially useful properties in microbes.</p>4) Microbial reductive dehalogenation</strong><br />Chloroethenes, such as PCE and TCE, are the most prevalent groundwater contaminants in the U.S. and the developed countries. Large scale remediation of contaminated aquifers relies largely on the activity of a group of unusual microbes (Dehalococcoides sp.) that derive energy from reductive dehalogenation, thereby, using the chlorinated </p>'

Our goal is to relate experimental measurements of atomic-scale processes to macroscopic properties of interest to the earth sciences (including mineralogy, igneous and metamorphic petrology, volcanology and geochemistry), materials sciences, and physical chemistry. Much of what we do lies at the interface between geochemistry and materials science.The major research tool in our group at this time is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. We have two fully-equipped labs for most sorts of modern solid-state high and low resolution NMR experiments. An unusual feature of the lab is our capability to do in-situ, high T studies up to about 1500 deg C.'

I have also been working on the development of X-ray emission spectroscopy for the atom-specific investigation of the surface chemical bond. My surface science interests then shifted to the study of orientation and relaxation phenomena at polymer surfaces, in particular, the alignment of liquid crystals on such surfaces. Today the major part of my research is concerned with magnetic materials and phenomena, in particular the study of magnetic thin films, interfaces and nanostructures. The studies are carried out with polarized synchrotron radiation which offers unique capabilities. Among them are the imaging of magnetic nanostructures with elemental, chemical and magnetic specificity, both by direct X-ray microscopy and holographic techniques. A particular exciting area are the direct observation of ultrafast (less than 1 nanosecond) magnetic processes by use of ultra-short X-ray pulses.My group is performing research at both the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), both located at SLAC.'

S'Using and Understanding Cell-Free Biology</b>Swartz Lab General Research Focus</b>The current and projected research in the Swartz lab balances basic research in microbial metabolism, protein expression, and protein folding with a strong emphasis on compelling applications. The power and versatility of cell-free methods coupled with careful evaluation and engineering of these new systems enables a whole new range of applications and scientific investigation. Fundamental research on: the mechanisms and kinetics of ribosomal function, fundamental bioenergetics, basic mechanisms of protein folding, functional genomics, and metabolic pathway analysis is motivated by a variety of near- and medium term applications spanning medicine, energy, and environmental needs.Swartz Lab Application Foci</b>In the medical area , current research addresses the need for patient-specific vaccines to treat cancer. Particularly for lymphomas, there is a strong need to be able to make a new cancer vaccine for each patient. Current technologies are not practical for this demanding task, but cell-free approaches are rapid and inexpensive. We have already demonstrated feasibility in mouse tumor challenge studies and are now expanding the range of applications and working to improve the relevant technologies. Experience with these vaccines has also suggested a new and exciting format for making inexpensive and very potent vaccines for general use.To address pressing needs for a new and cleaner energy source, we are working towards an organism that can efficiently capture solar energy and convert it into hydrogen. The first task is to develop an oxygen tolerant hydrogenase using cell-free technology to express libraries of mutated enzymes that can be rapidly screened for improved function. Even though these are very complex enzymes, we have produced active hydrogenases with our cell-free methods. We are now perfecting the screening methods for rapid and accurate identification of improved enzymes. After these new enzymes are identified, the project will progress toward metabolic engineering and bioreactor design research to achieve the scales and economies required.To address environmental needs, we are developing an improved water filters using an amazing membrane protein, Aquaporin Z. It has the ability to reject all other chemicals and ions except water. We have efficiently expressed the protein into lipid bilayer vesicles and are now working to cast these membranes on porous supports to complete the development of a new and powerful water purification technology. The same lessons will be applied toward the development of a new class of biosensors that brings high sensitivity and selectivity.'

S'Professor Thrun pursues research on artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning. He also works on distributed systems, human robot interaction, and programming language design. He is widely acknowledged to be a pioneer in the area of probabilistic robotics, which concerns itself with applying statistical techniques to problems in real-world perception, planning, and control. Within this area, he has focused on mobile robot exploration, mapping, and multi-robot coordination. Robots by Professor Thrun and his students have been deployed in museums as tour-guides; in elderly care facilities as personal assistants and walking aids, and in abandoned mines as tools for acquiring mine maps. Other robotic systems include submersible and aerial vehicles, and environments instrumented with many sensors. One of his robots won the DARPA Grand Challenge, which is regarded as a breakthrough in the area of self-driving cars. On the basic research level, he has pursued research on robust statistical programming techniques that scale to complex environments and to large decentralized robot systems.'

He is also co-principal investigator of the Programmable Digital Camera program, which is an industry-sponsored effort to develop programmable CMOS sensors. As part of this effort, Wandell and his team study and build devices used for digital imaging, including image sensors, high dynamic range displays, and software simulations of the digital imaging pipeline. Professor Wandell\x92s work in visual neuroscience uses both functional MRI and behavior testing to understand the action of the visual portions of the brain.  His team has developed a set of methods for identifying and measuring the signals in several visual areas within the human brain, including regions that respond powerful to motion and color. Recently, his team measured the reorganization of brain function during human development and following brain injury; they are now actively studying the development of visual signals during the age period in which children are learning to read.'

We are plotting genetic \x93phase diagrams\x94 that describe cell fates determined by combinatorial gene expression. To achieve these objectives, we are developing genetic tools that allow us to control gene expression and quantify phenotypic outcome.

S'Our group applies mechanistic principles to develop new concepts in catalysis. A particular focus is the development of organometallic and organic catalysts for the synthesis of complex macromolecular architectures. In organometallic catalysis, we investigate catalysts that can access multiple kinetic states during a polymerization reaction in order to control sequence distribution. We have devised a novel strategy for the synthesis of elastomeric polypropylene utilizing a metallocene catalyst whose structure was designed to interconvert between chiral and achiral coordination geometries on the timescale of the synthesis of a single polymer chain. We have also developed a novel method for the synthesis of alternating copolymers of ethylene and propylene by exploiting catalysts that can access multiple coordination sites that exhibit different kinetic selectivities towards the two monomers. In collaboration with Jim Hedrick of IBM laboratories, we have developed an extensive platform of organic catalysts for the controlled ring-opening polymerization of lactones. Mechanistic studies of nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbene catalysts revealed an unusual zwitterionic mechanism which enabled the synthesis of high molecular weight cyclic polyesters, a novel topology for these biodegradable and biocompatible macromolecules. These efforts combine elements of mechanistic organic and organometallic chemistry, polymer synthesis, and homogeneous catalysis to rationally design new macromolecular structures.'

Yock is known for his work in inventing, developing and testing new devices, including the Rapid Exchange \x99 balloon angioplasty system. The main focus of his research program has been in the field of intravascular ultrasound. He authored the fundamental patents for intravascular ultrasound imaging and conducted the initial clinical trials. Yock directs the Center for Research in Cardiovascular Interventions, which is a core facility for development and testing of new devices in cardiovascular medicine. The center focuses on early-stage concepts for new technologies, providing a clearinghouse where these ideas can be refined and tested in animal models and clinical studies. Recently Yock and colleagues have launched the Program in Biodesign, a new interschool initiative at Stanford that focuses on the invention and development of new medical technologies.'
