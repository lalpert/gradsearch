If you've ever tried to find grad schools you've probably found it be an infuriating experience.
Existing search engines are focused around finding a particular school.  This makes sense for an
undergraduate education, but for Grad School its all wrong.  You aren't looking for a school --
you're looking for a professor.  <Name> solves that problem.  Enter your research interests, broad
or specific, and browse through professors from dozens of universities studying what you're
studying.
