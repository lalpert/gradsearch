If you've ever tried to find grad schools you've probably found it be an infuriating experience.
Existing search engines are focused around finding a particular school.  This makes sense for an
undergraduate education, but for graduate school it's all wrong.  You aren't looking for a school --
you're looking for a professor.  <Name> solves that problem.  Enter your research interests, broad
or specific, and browse through professors from dozens of universities studying what you're
studying. 

To use <strong>re:</strong>search, enter a research interest, university, or professor's name into the search bar. 
<strong>re:</strong>search will display professors who match your query. Click on a professor to see their full profile, 
including a research summary, awards, and publications. If you register for the site, you can bookmark
professors to view later.
